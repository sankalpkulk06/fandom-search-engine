It's assumed it was here he developed his strong sense of honor and pride as a warrior, to combat the constant violence and death in his life.\nDuring his time in the arenas, Shatterstar formed a relationship withGringrave, a popular female gladiator commonly known as the Smiling Executioner. Gringrave manipulated Shatterstar for her own ends, teaching him not to love or get attached to others, and live only for the thrill of the kill.[14][15]\nEventually, Shatterstar grew disillusioned with the idea of killing for sport. He escaped and joined the Blood Cadre Alliance, the rebel group that sought to overthrowMojo V's dictatorship. From there, he learned the Cadre's language and began taking part in missions, one of which sent him back in time to find the X-Men and get their assistance in defeating Mojo.[16]\nWith X-Force\nInstead of finding the X-Men, Shatterstar was transported back in time to Earth at the point just before Cable reorganized theNew MutantsintoX-Force. WithCable's assurance that they would help him defeat Mojo, Shatterstar became a founding member of the new team.[17]X-Force was also where he first metRictor. Shatterstar and Rictor formed a close friendship. Shatterstar learned Spanish specifically to communicate privately with Rictor.[18]After an awkward trip to a nightclub, Shatterstar also confessed to Ric that he wasn't emotionally prepared for physical interaction, due to his upbringing on Mojoworld. Rictor vowed to help Star with his development.[19]\nLater Shatterstar discovered, to his bewilderment, that he also had the memories of an Earthling namedBenjamin Russell.[8]Soon afterwards, Mojo made Cable and Shatterstar his prisoners and transformed them into digital images for one of his television programs. In the course of the show, Shatterstar was mortally wounded in combat. Mojo's sometime allySpiralteleported Cable and Shatterstar back into reality, where they regained their true forms. Spiral brought Cable, Shatterstar, Longshot, and the X-Force memberSirynto theWeisman Institute for the Criminally InsaneinRutland,Vermont.[citation needed]\nThere Spiral directed them to the bedside of one of its patients, a mutant named Benjamin Russell who had no living relatives, had been in a coma since his powers had emerged, and, curiously, looked identical to Shatterstar. Longshot transferred Shatterstar's \"uemeur,\" or soul, into Benjamin Russell's body, and the two became one. Apparently Shatterstar's body merged with Russell's as well, for the resulting body bore the starburst pattern that Shatterstar had around his left eye and his hair lengthened greatly. Restored to full health and consciousness, and feeling \"whole\" for the first time in his life, Shatterstar resumed his work as a member of X-Force.[20]\nShatterstar accompanied Rictor to the Richter home inMexicoto try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business.[21][22]Presumably they succeeded, though it's not known why they later parted.\nShatterstar was later inMadripoor, earning his money by fighting in arenas. He was sought out by Spiral, who had one of her agents make Shatterstar believe she wanted to kill him. With a fake quest, Spiral lured Shatterstar to an alternate universe she had conquered and ruled. On that Earth, Spiral had also killed most of that worlds heroes and mutants. That Earth's Shatterstar had been killed as well. He was found by that Earth's rebel forces, including Cable and some others he knew from X-Force. Together, they eventually defeated Spiral.[23]Upon returning to the mainstream Earth, Shatterstar was contacted by Cable, who requested that Shatterstar temporarily join him on a mission to defeat theSkornn. Shatterstar agreed, but first Cable wanted him to train with monks on Mount Xixabangma. After those monks were killed by Skornn's worshipers, Shatterstar was reunited with his old team and they eventually killed the Skornn.[24]\nFollowingM-Dayand the passing of theSuperhuman Registration Act, Shatterstar teamed up with former X-Force alliesDominoandCalibanto breakThe 198out of the encampment set up for mutants on the grounds of theXavier Institute. They took the escapees to a secret base provided to them byCaptain AmericaviaNick Fury. While fightingO*N*Ehe nearly killedMicromax, claiming that while there is no such thing as murder during war, he had only meant to disable him.[25]\nAt some unknown point,Cortexgained control over Shatterstar and sent him to attack his friends. While searching for Madrox, Rictor andStrong GuydiscoveredFather Maddox, a dupe of Madrox's, that had been living in New England as a priest. They decided to investigate further, hoping to find the whereabouts of Madrox Prime. Upon meeting Father Maddox, a masked man crashed through the window with swords ablaze. After a brief battle, the attacker was revealed to be Shatterstar, possessed by Cortex.[26]\nRictor and Shatterstar kissing\nOnce Shatterstar was broken out of his trance-like state, and recognized Rictor, the two embraced one another and finally shared a kiss.[27]\nShortly afterwards Shatterstar transported X-Factor toLatveria, where he remained withLayla MillerandDoctor Doomfor a while.[28]Layla and Shatterstar next appeared atDublin Airportto saveTerry CassidyfromTrask'sMutant Response Division.[29]After they escaped, the trio rejoined the rest of X-Factor back in New York City.[30]\nRictor and Shatterstar began a steady romantic relationship after Shatterstar's return though not without its difficulties. Rictor, having finally come to terms with his sexual identity, wanted a stable monogamous relationship with Shatterstar. Shatterstar, on the other hand, found himself interested in a more open relationship that would allow him to explore other sexual possibilities. The two resolved that they would work things out, and proceeded to make up both emotionally and physically. However, before they could get very far, the two were interrupted when a pregnantWolfsbanebarged in.[5]\nWolfsbane was pregnant withHrimhari's child, although she led Rictor and the others to believe he was the father.[31]This lie did not last long as a brief encounter between Hrimhari and Shatterstar inNiffleheimcleared up the question of paternity.[32]\nAfter the birth and abandonment ofWolfsbane's son, Shatterstar and Rictor volunteered (unsolicited) to accompany Wolfsbane in searching for her child.[33]The trio first traveled toHeland receive a mystic amulet to locate the child, and finally found him inSproul State ForestinPennsylvania. Wolfsbane's son,Tier, was being tracked independently by bothDarwinandVanorabut Shatterstar and Rictor were able to fight off attacks from both, and Tier escaped unharmed with his mother. Wolfsbane then chose to leave X-Factor and raise Tier with the aid and protection ofJack Russell, the Werewolf By Night.[34]Shatterstar and Rictor, however, returned to X-Factor Investigations in New York City.[35]\nAfter Rahne and her son, Tier, returned to X-Factor to seek sanctuary from Darwin and other would-be assassins, all of X-Factor were transported toHell. TheHell Lordsvied to gain overall control by killing Tier, and X-Factor fought their demon armies to protect him. When Shatterstar attackedMephistoto free Tier from a magical prison, Mephisto seemingly vaporised him, before doing the same to Rictor.[36]\nIn fact, Rictor and Shatterstar both ended up going back in time and being transported to theMojoverse. Shatterstar was again brainwashed into attacking Rictor - this time in a televised gladiatorial battle. Rictor managed to incapacitate Shatterstar, before escaping the arena with help from Mojoverse rebels, including the Longshot of this era. Whilst he was unconscious, Shatterstar was brought toArize, who cloned him (and used some of his DNA to create Longshot). Shatterstar awoke in time to use his powers to escape an attack byMojoandSpiral, and Shatterstar transported them forward in time. In this new time period, Rictor came acrossDazzlergiving birth to Shatterstar as a baby. Rictor and Shatterstar helped to deliver the baby, before Shatterstar erased Dazzler's memory. To maintain the timeline as it was meant to take place, Shatterstar then transported himself, Rictor, and his infant self forward in time again - by 100 years - to the period he grew up in.[13]\nShatterstar and Rictor somehow made it back to Earth and their own time, and joined their fellow mutants - including former teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane - inNew Tian.[37]After New Tian was dismantled, Rictor told Iceman that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.[38]\nShatterstar rejoined the X-Men in New York to investigate signs that thePhoenix Forcemight have returned to Earth, checking the Manhattan sewers in a team with Dazzler and Strong Guy.[39]\nRictor and Shatterstar try to navigate their newly separated status\nFeeling unsure about himself and his relationship with Rictor, Shatterstar ended things between them.[40]Newly single, Shatterstar bought a property using the earnings he'd made and named it Manor Crossing. He offered the rooms to multi-dimensional refugees like himself and served as both landlord and protector to his tenants. When Shatterstar's tenants were kidnapped by the Mojoworld mercenary group theDeath Sponsorsand their leader, former allyGringrave, Shatterstar vowed to bring them home.[7]\nWith help from Rictor, Shatterstar followed the group to the world of Horus IV, which was ruled by theGrandmaster. Grandmaster tasked Gringrave with the kidnapping, hoping to use a gladiatorial battle between the enemies to satisfy the Horuvians lust for bloody conflict.[40]\nAfter Shatterstar killed Gringrave in revenge for her actions,[15]Grandmaster himself entered the arena, seeking to gain control of Shatterstar for all eternity. But Shatterstar refused to concede and defeated Grandmaster by teleporting them toEarth-1218, a world where super-powered beings do not exist and Grandmaster's god powers could not work. Shatterstar was then rescued by Rictor, who reached out across the universe to find him and bring him home.[41]\nShatterstar was shocked when his former mentor Cable was slain while attempting to protect the time-displaced Iceman.[42]When it was revealed that a younger version of Cable was responsible, Shatterstar partnered with his former X-Force teammates to hunt downKid Cableand have him answer for his crime. During the search, Shatterstar was turned into one ofAhab's mutant-hunting hounds and attempted to kill the time-displaced Jean Grey.[43]Shatterstar was subdued by Cannonball and freed of Ahab's influence.[44]\nAfter Kid Cable returned the time-displaced X-Men to their timeline and disappeared, Shatterstar joined a newly reformed X-Force to resume their search for him. They found Kid Cable in the small nation ofTransia, working withDeathlokto uncover how the country's military had gotten ahold of weapons from Kid Cable's future. Shatterstar and his team were forced to team up with Kid Cable when they were framed for the murder of the Transian president.[45]\nShatterstar struggled to trust Kid Cable and accept him as the real Nathan Summers,[46]but the pair worked together with the rest of X-Force to defeat the Transian military. They learned the military's futuristic weapons were being supplied byStryfethrough a time portal.[47]Strye took Kid Cable into the future through the portal and X-Force resolved to rescue both him and the kidnappedRachel Summers. Shatterstar was prepared to give his life for the potentially one-way mission, feeling like there was little left for him since Rictor's presumed death.[48]\nX-Force defeated Stryfe, rescued both Kid Cable and Rachel Summers, and found a way to return to their timeline. Shatterstar finally declared his trust in Kid Cable and forgave him for murdering the older Cable. Shatterstar also resolved to return to the present, stop seeking distractions, and instead focus on grieving Rictor properly.[49]\nShatterstar was of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation ofKrakoaupon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.[50]\nAt some point, Shatterstar returned to Mojoworld, becoming the dimension's most subscribed and top-ranked live-streamer. However, Shatterstar began to feel trapped by the celebrity status he had created for himself. When fellow live-streamerWind Dancerarranged for her own death to satisfy her fans, Shatterstar secretly informed the KrakoanX-Factorteam so they could claim her body beforeArizecould produce a clone and force Wind Dancer to resume her stream. X-Factor were successful in their mission, but had to leave Shatterstar behind in Mojoworld. They promised to one day return and rescue him.[51]The team eventually made good on this promise coming back alongside the New Mutants and arranging the freedom of all mutants there. After this they recruited Shatterstar to defeatThe Morrigan, freeingSirynfrom her control.[52]He was then rewarded with memories of his past, which lead to him seeking Rictor out during the Hellfire Gala,[53]after which they sat on the coastline of the newly created Braddock Isle and caught up with one another.[54]\nReunited with Rictor, Shatterstar joinedExcaliburin their battle againstKing ArthurinOtherworld.[55]He became one ofCaptain Britain'sKnights of Xand helped her to liberate Otherworld.[56]\nShatterstar is a mutant,[58]the naturally born son of the mutant Dazzler and the artificially-engineered Biped Longshot.[13]As a result, he was born with many of the superhuman traits Longshot was engineered to possess, in addition to his own unique mutant abilities. Shatterstar also merged withBenjamin Russell, with whom he shares an unexplained connection. Russell was also reportedly a mutant.[59]Russell's mutant powers are unknown, but Shatterstar did not appear to gain or lose any abilities when the two merged. Although his teleporting ability surfaced after he bonded with Russell, the two events happened 13 years apart and were not noticeably connected.[60]"

Her older sister,Komand'rwas the first in the line of succession, but she was crippled by a childhood illness that robbed her of her natural Tamaranean ability to convert ultraviolet light into flight energy. Therefore, she was deemed unworthy to be queen and the succession fell to Koriand'r. When both sisters were sent to train with the legendaryWarlords of Okaara, the bitter Komand'r ran off, allying herself with theCitadel. They used Komand'r's information to successfully invade Tamaran, andKing Myand'rturned Koriand'r over to the Citadel to ensure peace.\nKoriand'r endured six years of torture and sexual abuse until she and Komand'r were both released to thePsionsfor experimentation. Largely sadistic scientists, the Psions performed a deadly experiment on both sisters to see just how much energy their Tamaranean bodies could absorb before exploding from the overload. During the procedure, forces loyal to Komand'r attacked the Psion ship to rescue her, and while the Psions were distracted, Koriand'r broke free using her new ability of starbolts (destructive blasts of solar energy) acquired through the experimentation. Against her better judgment, she decided to free Komand'r who was still absorbing energy. However, far from grateful, Komand'r struck her sister down with the same - but much stronger - starbolt power and had her restrained for later execution. Koriand'r escaped and eventually found her way to Earth, where she gained the help of theTeen Titans.[1]She chose to remain with the team and took the nameStarfire, and quickly formed a romantic relationship withDick Grayson, then - asRobin- the leader of the team.\nShe has been married twice, both times to Tamaranean men: once toPrince Karrasto seal a peace treaty, and once toGeneral Ph'yzzonfor love. Both of her husbands died in battle. She even dated and fell in love with a human man named Franklin Crandall, who turned out to be a freelance spy working forH.I.V.E.and was eventually killed.[2]She almost married Dick Grayson, but their wedding was interrupted byRaven, who had followed in the footsteps of her father, the demonTrigon. Raven murdered the priest before he pronounced Dick and Kory husband and wife. The relationship was already on unsteady ground, with Kory fearing that Dick was rushing into marriage and also being concerned by the anti-alien sentiments that sprang up in response to the news of the impending nuptials. She had casual relations withCaptain Comet, who clearly felt more for her than she did for him.[3][4][5]\nStarfire has served as mentor/teacher to the latest roster of Teen Titans, and also began serving with theOutsiders.\nStarfire was stranded on a paradise-like planet with fellow heroesAnimal ManandAdam Strangeafter the battle withAlexander Luthor, Jr.andSuperboy-Prime. After several weeks, Adam was able to get his spaceship working, and they departed for Earth. Their ship, however, was attacked byDevilance, who they had encountered on the planet and who had pursued them into space.Loboappeared just in time to destroy Devilance and, after some negotiation, agreed to help them out.\nWhen it was believed that Animal Man had perished in battle againstLady Styx, Starfire took it upon herself to bring his jacket back to his surviving family on Earth. Upon reaching Earth, however, she quickly discovered that Animal Man was still alive.\nAfter the apparent defeat of Lady Styx, Starfire once again returned to Animal Man's home, where she recovered from her recent adventures and regained control of her returned powers. One afternoon while sunbathing, she and Animal Man's son were attacked by a water demon in Buddy's swimming pool. Meanwhile, her old Titan teammates had also been attacked by assorted demonic entities. This led to Starfire,Nightwing,Troia,Cyborg,Beast Boy,Raven, Flash andRed Arrowto reassemble as a team. They then realized that the attacks were the result of a resurrectedTrigonand his newly discovered three sons. While investigating, the Titans began to experience unexplained mood-shifts. For Starfire and Nightwing, they were overwhelmed by lust and ended up having abrupt sex in the middle of their investigation.\nSoon after, the team met up inNew York'sCentral Park, where they attempted to recover from these mood-shifts and came to the realization that each shift coincided with one of the seven deadly sins. The team was then approached by the Sons of Trigon. They battled the villainous prodigy, and drove them away. Starfire and Nightwing then had a discussion about their actions while under the influence of Trigon's sons. While Nightwing shows hints at wanting to renew their relationship, Starfire questions his commitment to the relationship and goes so far as to ask Nightwing whether or not he's ready for them to be together without ever having to find excuses. Nightwing to his own surprise and reluctance admits that while he does love her and always will, he is not. This leads to them, at least for now, leaving their reunion in doubt.[6]\nMost recently, she has been captured and turned into aJustifier, as seen inFinal Crisis:Resist. She has since been freed. Although the loss of control she gathered from the Justifier helmet distressed her severely, causing her to lash out at anyone remotely looking like they are wearing one of the helmets. She was more than happy to destroy a warehouse full of them whenMister Terrificoffered her and Cyborg the chance. After a stint with a psychiatrist (instead of talking to Donna, which troubled her to no end), and a subsequent denial of joining the Justice League, she is left none the healthier.\nMost recently during Hero's Day, a time when the heroes of the DC universe join together in remembrance of dead comrades, Starfire and the Titans were attacked byBlack Lanternversions of their fallen teammates. During the battle, Starfire and Cyborg were subjected to a psychic attack by the Black Lantern Omen which put them both in a euphoric state as they experienced their greatest desires. For Starfire, her greatest desire came in the form of her marrying Dick Grayson (indicating that she is still deeply in love with him). Luckily both she and Cyborg were rescued by Beast Boy and, with their attackers eventually defeated by Dove, Starfire and the Titans prepared to face the Black Lanterns head on.\nKory was recently invited to joinKimiyo Hoshi's new Justice League by Donna Troy. She joined the team briefly and left soon after. But not before leaving a note to Dick explaining why she had left. She then joined the R.E.B.E.L.S. and returned to where Tamaran used to be, to find that it had mysteriously returned.[7][8][9]\nTwo versions of Starfire are taken to Convergence, the Pre-crisis version and the New Earth version. Pre-crisis Gotham and Pre-Flashpoint Gotham are taken byBrainiacandTelosand they lose their powers for a year.\nBefore the dome goes down, Pre-crisis Starfire marriesNightwingand attempts to stop a robbery. After the dome goes down, she stops the robbers and later fights the Earth-9Doom Patrol.[10]She and the Titans later ally with the Doom Patrol.[11]\nMeanwhile, before the dome went down, New Earth Starfire is seen talking to herNightwingabout a secret, which was later revealed to be him proposing toBarbara.[12]After the dome goes down, she, Donna and Roy fight the Extremists.[13][14]She and the Titans later fight the Extremists again and they are saved by theEarth-2 Justice League.[15]\nWhat happened to both Starfires afterNew Earth Superman, Earth One Supergirl,ParallaxHal Jordan, and Pre-Crisis Barry Allen prevent the First-Crisis is unknown.\nTamaranean Physiology: Starfire's powers are largely derived from her alien physiology; her body constantly absorbs ultraviolet radiation and converts it to energy, which can be used for a variety of purposes.\n\n\nThis character is or was primarily a member of the younger superhero team known as theTeen Titans, in any of itsvarious incarnations.

Shatterstarfire and Niles fight onwards valiantly and bravely, but the creatures continue on to be too strong and too many. Niles says to Shatterstarfire to abandon the battle and go to the X-patrol.\nShatterstarfire is hesitant to leave Niles at the hands of Brother Brood's hands, but she doesn't have any choice at this point. As she returns, she explains the situation to her team that there is a group or army of creatures hiding underneath Zenosha; and they have taken Niles with them. The team tries to hatch a plan but everything goes off to an unfriendly start due to the recent recruitment of a man named Jericho.\nMembers such as Ferro Man and Beastling question his alliance due to a tragedy that was lead by the recruitment of Hawk and Dagger. Elasti-Girl however, backs up Jericho and says that he can be trusted like anyone of the other members of the team. The scene switches towards Niles Cable who is chained up in a chamber. Upon his despair, a woman came upon him to remind him of the dark future to come. She is called Reveniya the Healer. She reminds him of the great heroes that were lost during his time.\nHeroes such as the Deaddevil, The Atomic Black Knight, The Black Orchid, Silver Tornado and Niles' lost love; Raveniya herself came surging in his mind. As the X-Patrol enter the Brood Lair, they are ambushed tons of broodlings. They fight onward, rushing to meet their objective which is to find Niles and get out. As they fight forward, they meet upon Brother Brood who is about to start the ceremony which would implant Niles Cable with broodlings. Upon realizing this, Brother Brood sends out a familiar face to go against the X-Patrol.\nHe sends out the traitor, Terra-X the Destroyer. She tackles Jericho in full combat but thanks to Elasti-Girl, Terra goes down fast. As they defeat Terra, Jericho's Telepathy hears Niles' voice proving that Niles' is still alive. This revelation, however, is cut short as they are met upon an explosion that takes the entire team down. It was Niles Cable and he is under the control of the brood.\nJericho then says that he must be defeated since he himself knows the future to come if they are defeated. This knowledge of the future Jericho possesses alarms some members, but the battle still goes on. They realize that the only way to prevent Brother Brood's plan to conquer the earth using both niles and the broodlings is by killing Niles himself. The X-patrol tackle Niles at the same time, but Niles lets out another explosion that takes out the entire team leaving Jericho alone to face him.\nAs the battle continues between both individuals, Jericho gets hit by one of Niles' attacks which destroys Jericho's rocky \"skin\". The rocky covering surrounding Jericho's entire body is just a disguise, he is actually Niles Dayspring, an earlier form of Niles Cable. Niles Dayspring or Jericho lets out his Soul Self which defeats Niles Cable and kills Brother Brood.\nThis also defeats the brood inside of Cable. Upon Cable's defeat, the Techno Virus that is locked deep within him starts to emerge upon his body which is slowly killing him. Upon, what seems to be Cable's slow death, Raveniya emerges and says that it isn't his time yet and heals him of the virus. The team were shocked and at the same time joyful of the outcome. With both the Brother Brood and the brood inside cable dead, Niles speaks to the team and says \"To the future X-Patrol\""

Siryn flies through an abandoned church and Shatterstar looks to catch her. He breaks through the glass ceiling and catches her. She suddenly has a vision of Deadpool asking her for help. Shatterstar asks her what is wrong and she says she remembers everything.\nSouth Beach, MiamiRisque and Warpath go for a joyride through the city. Warpath is speeding and is running from the cops. He feels very alive with Risque. He tells her that he has not felt this alive in years and they passionately embrace in a kiss. Jimmy thinks to himself that he has forgotten about Siryn and then thinks that he is bringing real life into his new fantasy.\nWeisman InstituteSiryn and Shatterstar steal an ambulance and head off to the Weisman Institute by themselves. They didn't tell anyone else that they were going either. When they break in, Shatterstar disappears into the building while Siryn goes off on her own. Shatterstar comes across Deadpool, Dr. Weisman and Gamesmaster. They welcome him as Benjamin and tell him he's been a bad boy. Siryn, meanwhile, is taunted by a hallucination of Deadpool.\nSouth Beach, MiamiWarpath and Risque continue on their motorcycle down the road. They hear a person scream out for help. When they arrive, they find a person being rounded up by the Friends of Humanity and being razed for being a mutant. The man tells the group that he is not a mutant and they threaten to beat him up still. Warpath saves the man from the group and Risque destroys their bikes. The group runs off and the victim is just as scared since he also blames the mutants for the problem in the first place.\nWeisman InstituteSiryn continues to be haunted by several Deadpool visions that sing to her and taunt her. She finally calls him out on it and the visions stop. She is left in Deadpool's room and she asks him what went on after she left. He tells her that he is ready for it all to stop. Then, Dr. Weisman and Gamesmaster enter the room. Siryn soon finds out that Dr. Weisman is now being the one possessed. She holds the sword up to her and the Gamesmaster congratulates her on winning his game. Deadpool thanks Terry by kissing her.\nTerry later runs into Shatterstar as they are leaving. He is stricken with fear and she asks him why he did not help her out inside. He tells her that Gamesmaster told him things about his past that have stunned him. He says he was told that he is really a human being named Benjamin Russell and that his life as Shatterstar is a made up fantasy. He also says he believes that he was told the truth."

Guido and Rictor discuss Rictor's bisexuallity, with Guido being weirded out and surprised by it because Rictor never told him. While driving under an overpass, a man attempting suicide jumps from the bridge, but Guido catches him with his arm out the driver-side window. He warns the jumper not to try that agin or he'll come back and beat him up, then throw the fellow into bushes by the side of the road.\nShatterstar wakes him a describes how he was returning from the Mojoverse (which had become different from how he remembered it), when he met something else travelling through the dimensions, then all he could hear was \"Cortex\" until he woke up after the fight with Guido and Rictor andJohn Maddox's church. After Rictor comments on the long drive, Shatterstar touches Rictor's head and has him think of where he wants to go. Shatterstar cuts a hole in the roof, stands up, and opens an X-shaped portal that teleports them home.\nArriving, they findVal Cooperwho warns them that the rest of X-Factor is in danger at the Carlton Hotel. Shatterstar introduces himself to Val, kisses her, then jumps back into the car, and the three drive off to the hotel.\n80 years in the future, theSummers Rebellionis celebrating after defeating someSentinelsinPhiladelphia.Madrox, after some ruminating, asksLayla Millerif it's all going to go to crap soon. She says yes, and he asks if there is anything that he can do to stop, to which she replies no. Then he asks her if he's the cause of it, she replies that he's only part of the cause. When asked then why did she bring him forward, she replies that she's the other part of the cause and that misery loves company.\nBack at the rebellion's base,CyclopsquestionsVictor von Doomwhile Doom is working on the device to bringCortexforward through time. Doom admits that he gaveDoctor Falconethe technology necessary to build the doomlock cyborg, for no reason than that it suited him to do so. Then Doom compares himself and Cyclops, saying they are both relics of a more elegant time. That he sought power for his personal gain, and that Cyclops sought power for the benefit of the commonweal, but that the commonweal despised them both, Summers even more than Doom. This was because the public could understand Doom's selfish motivations, but were suspicious of Summer's altruism.\nBack in the past, the fight turns on X-Factor. After Shatterstar cuts off Cortex's arm, he recognizes Cortex as the being who enslaved his mind and charges him. However, the arm on the ground grabs Shatterstar's leg, trips him, then grabs his neck and chokes him. Cortex then fires an energy blast at Guido' chest, knocking him down while Cortex affirms his goal of annihilating every one of them.\nIn the future, Madrox,Ruby Summers, andtrevor Fitzrotarrive at Doom's workshop, looking for Scott. Doom tells them that Cyclops isn't there, then activates his device.\nIn the past, Cortex is gloating that Lenore only has Rictor andDarwinleft to defend her. Just as Lenore screams at him to \"go away\" Dooms device activates and Cortex is dragged forward in time. Madrox is shocked to recognize Cortex as one of his dupes. Then Dooms announces that his technology has overridden Cortex's maker's commands, leaving Cortex in Doom's control. Doom then orders Cortex to kill all the mutants.\nhttp://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12864"

It looks like Shatterstar died in Mojo's twisted digitized world. His soul was then put inside the body of Benjamin Russell from that point forward. I am thinking that fromX-Force#61forward it should be Benjamin Russell's appearances that should be noted. How would we handle this character since it is Benjamin's body and partial memories along with Shatterstar's memories in this one being? --M1shawhan02:43, June 28, 2010 (UTC)\nYeah, and Mojo's not the least bit egomaniacal, the type of guy who would believe himself unique in the multiverse even if he was face to face with a counterpart. I'd suggest taking anything where we've only got Mojo's word on a matter with a massive dollop of salt. He might be unique in the multiverse (in which case you need to combine all the Mojo entries bar the Ultimate, only sharing the same name, version, into one entry - if he's unique then the ones who turned up in the cartoons are the same one who is in the comics), but the jury remains out until independent evidence surfaces to either support or refute Mojo's claim.Lokiofmidgaard11:52, June 29, 2010 (UTC)\nAm I the only one who hates the idea of them together? I'm no homophobe, but why is Peter Davids doing this? I know he says it seemed like they used to like each other back inX-Force Vol 1, but that was more of a father/son relationship, not like how hes making it out to be. I just dont think characters created both about twenty years ago should both allofasudden change.. --Johnnybravo4403:35, June 30, 2010 (UTC)\nIs Shatterstar actually a mutant? Since he's from the Mojoverse, I always assumed he was just genetically created, like Longshot. \n--GrnMarvl1401:35, July 15, 2010 (UTC)\nEven if he isn't himself, the human body he merged with, Benjamin Russel, is a mutant.Lokiofmidgaard15:26, July 15, 2010 (UTC)\nCould this maybe be Benjamin Russell's mutant power, since Shatterstar never displayed it until after merging with Russell's body?DFChewie05:13, March 22, 2012 (UTC)\nShatterstar being revealed as Dazzler and Longshot's son means his name should be Shatterstar as that is the main and true name of the character.Gaveedra-Seven is rarely used or aknowledged. -The precedingunsignedcomment was added bySlightlyv(talk•contribs).\nI don't believe this page should be merged withBenjamin Russell (Earth-616). InX-Force#61, there is an extensive explanation about Ben Russell being a mutant kid from Boston whose powers threw him into a coma. His life essence was merged with Shatterstar's in order to save his life. He can't be Shatterstar, who is the son / genetic template of Longshot, as explained inX-Factor#259. -BloodyNinja(talk) 22:53, 14 July 2024 (UTC)"

They lived a very strict life, saving as much as they could, and they tried to teach Guido to appreciate this way of life, but he didn't pay attention, preferring to goof around.[2]\nHe was very successful academically when he was younger, but he didn't fit in with the other kids, so he tried to be the class clown to win their approval, namely of a young girl namedSheila McCann. One day, Sheila winked at him, and Guido tried to start a conversation with her, but her boyfriend and his friends beat Guido up. As he fell to the floor, his mutant genes became active and his arm grew to enormous proportions due to his new energy absorption powers. In pain and confusion, he then stumbled in front of the school bus. The impact caused his body to distort permanently. Before long, he realized that the energy he absorbed had to be released immediately to avoid deformities.[15]\nAfter his parents were killed by a falling satellite, Guido settled with the owners for a considerable sum[2]and moved in with his aunt and uncle until he reached adulthood.[7]\nAfter losing much of his fortune, he began to take on jobs that would allow him to maintain his luxurious lifestyle. This led to Guido becoming the long-time roadie and bouncer for the mutant musicianLila Cheney.[2]He was later among the mutants living onMuir Islandwho were mentally controlled by the telepathShadow King. In order to satiate his bloodlust, the Shadow King encouraged arena fighting amongst the Muir Island personnel. Guido received a serious beating at the hands ofRogue.[16]\nAfter the Shadow King was defeated, several of the Muir Island mutants, with the help ofValerie Cooper, were recruited into the newX-Factorteam. His teammates included the formerX-MenHavokandPolaris, as well asWolfsbaneandQuicksilver. At this time, Guido picked up the codename \"Strong Guy\" as a joke at an X-Factor press conference.[2]\nOne of the first villains the team faced wasMister Sinisterand his lackeys, the 'Nasty Boys'. Sinister wished to discredit mutantkind and used X-Factor to do so. One of Sinister's behind-the-scenes allies was a power-hungry Senator with the power to cause bad luck, who manipulated Strong Guy into destroying the Washington Monument while fightingSlab, one of the Nasty Boys. The Senator, who was after the entirety of the X-Factor team, was later slain by Mr. Sinister himself.[17]\nDuring his time on the team, he had a blossoming romantic relationship with a powerful Genoshan mutant and political dissident namedJo Beth. He even visited her Grandmother at her calm, suburban home on the island ofGenosha. She took a shine to him instantly.[15]\nAlso, he participated in the cosmic incidents known as the Infinity War and Infinity Crusade. During the 'War', he and the other superheroes survived a bomb attack on theFantastic Fourheadquarters, thanks to theInvisible Woman. Strong Guy was specifically picked out to be one of the heroes to mystically travel the dimensions. He first participated in a fight with the Infinity Watch, holding up against such cosmic powerhouses asDrax the Destroyer. He would later be a vital part in the final battle against the villain's doppelganger's hordes, though this was a distraction so other forces could go in and defeat the villain.[18]\nDuring the 'Crusade' he was part of the assault team that landed in various spots around the Goddess' cathedral. Their goal was to gain back their brainwashed friends and defeat the Goddess's cosmic-powered plans. He teamed up withFirestarfrom theNew Warriors. She was soon taken out by the brainwashed duo ofPuckfromAlpha FlightandSpider-Man. Strong Guy defeated Spider-Man in a swift, tree-smashing battle, despite being blinded by webbing to the face.Doctor Strange, also brainwashed, soon restrained Strong Guy in a bubble of mystic force, where he stayed while events played out.[19]\nGuido suffered a deep depression after being poisoned byCyber, the leader of the mercenary groupHell's Belles. While at a government laboratory where a cure had been developed, Havok seemingly drank a sample of the poison himself, in order to show Strong Guy that he was with him. This helped boost Strong Guy's morale, though unbeknownst to him, Havok had switched the poison sample to simple tap water. Strong Guy later participated in the battle that took down the Hell's Belles, through Cyber himself escaped after colliding with a subway train.[20]\nAnother subway train incident turned out much worse, as Strong Guy investigated a train crash where a small dog was the only survivor. Inevitably, the carnage deeply affected his morale.[21]\nGuido was once teleported naked from his shower by his old friend, Lila Cheney, who wished to show him the universe again. He managed to convince her that he had a life back in X-Factor, where she reluctantly returned him.[22]\nComforting Rahne\nGuido developed a deep friendship with the lycanthropeRahne Sinclair(Wolfsbane). They went on a road trip with the mutantRandom, where Guido showed Rahne his hometown friends.[23]Guido personally escorted Wolfsbane to Muir Island when she needed special medical attention.[22]\nHe remained a member of X-Factor until an incident in the South Seas island nation ofMadripoor. Again involved with Lila Cheney, the team became trapped in a confrontation between her and the alien race, the K'Lanti. Lila had stolen an object of great value, called the Harmonium, during the midst of political chaos. The aliens, after destroying a city block, dispersed diamond-shaped bombs throughout the city. Despite the neutralization of the bombs and the return of their object, the aliens left behind one last explosive. Guido absorbed the energy of its explosion. Despite releasing it with powerful punches, he suffered a powerful heart attack.[24]\nGuido spent much time in suspended animation, until the return of his seemingly-dead friend theMultiple Man, Jamie Madrox. Not fully understanding the situation, Madrox freed Guido, who continued to suffer.Forgecreated a device to heal him.[25]Afterward he chose to accompany Lila and her band in their travels instead of rejoining the increasingly fractious X-Factor team. Guido became involved in a property dispute between warring alien races, both of whom wished to control a small, barren moon. This dispute was settled when the moon was destroyed during an exchange of weapons on both sides.[26]\nAfter leaving X-Factor, Guido fell on hard times. With Lila nowhere to be found, and finding it difficult to find hero work as a mutant, Guido opted to join the Arena inTokyo, a mutant fight club. Guido did not fully understand what he was getting into, however, and found himself enslaved. WhenStormandYukiocame to investigate the club, Guido helped them bring it down together withCallisto.[27]\nStrong Guy moved toNew York Cityto become the enforcer for his friend Madrox's detective agency,X-Factor Investigations, thus rejoining many of his former teammates from the government-sponsored incarnation of X-Factor. The team included Wolfsbane,Rictor,Siryn,Layla Miller, andM.[28]\nGuido was assigned to protect a former employee ofSingularity Investigations,Henry Buchanan, who had proof of their illegal activities. However, Guido instead killed the man and then called Singularity CEODamian Tryp, revealing he was working as a mole inside X-Factor.[6]\nGuido tried to tell the team that the man had vanished on him but Wolfsbane smelled his blood on Guido's hands and a psychic scan by Monet revealed the truth. It seemed Guido had been subjected to hypnotic conditioning by Tryp to turn him into a mole (which explained his rougher attitude and some inconsistencies in his personality).[29]\nA visit with Henry's widow did not go as expected: instead of reacting angrily,Alix Buchananunderstood the circumstances in which Guido had acted, and forgave him. They found solace together in their mutual grief from Henry's death.[30]\nDespite Monet's recurring undermining behavior towards Guido,[31][32]and clear lack of interest in him,[33][31][7]he developed feelings for her[34]and, whenher fatherwas kidnapped, he offered to help her, refusing any payment.[35]\nNew Uniform\nUsing some old contacts, Guido got some intel about the kidnapping, and the pair headed to his last known location in South America. While approaching the destination, their plane was gunned down and they were separated. Strong Guy found himself in a small village, where he was told to look for a \"Señora Piernas\". He paid her a visit and the cartel leader sympathized with him, revealing that some terrorists had suspiciously settled on an abandoned temple not long before. Before leaving, he was offered two guides to take him there and was advised to share his feelings with Monet.[34]\nAt the temple, he was attacked by the sorcererBaron Mordo, but after the arrival ofBolivar Trask's forces, they both had to retreat to the temple, where Guido was reunited with Monet and her father. He learned that Mordo had kidnapped Monet’s father to get bring Monet to him and absorb her life energy to cure his cancer. As the temple was about to be bombed by the forces outside, Monet agreed to help Mordo with his illness in exchange for teleporting them all back to New York.[36]\nAfter arriving, however, Monet tricked Mordo by using her telepathy, and he left thinking himself cured.[37]\nDuring a protest, Guido was shot byBallistique, who was trying to assassinateMayor J. Jonah Jameson, and his injuries were exacerbated when a Mandroid fell on him. As Monet flew him to the hospital, he professed his love for her. Unfortunately, his wound proved fatal, and he died in the hospital.[38]\nLayla apologizes\nHeartbroken,Layla Millerused her reanimation powers to secretly bring him back to life, much to the astonishment of X-Factor andDoctor Castillo. In reality, she could bring people back, but not their souls, which led her to tearfully apologize and promise Guido she'd find a way to fix his situation, leaving Strong Guy as clueless as before.[39][40]\nGuido began acting more aggressively. Losing his soul made him increasingly callous and stripped him of much of his empathy and care for innocents. After a frustrating failed date with M, he quit X-Factor.[41]He later returned, working forMephistoagainst the other Hell Lords,[42]but, after Monet died, he betrayed everyone and murdered Wolfsbane's sonTier Sinclairin order to become the Supreme Hell Lord and have the power to revive her.[5]\nWhen theThunderboltswere accidentally stranded in Hell, they made a deal with Mephisto to get out in exchange for dethroning the \"pretender,\" who was revealed to them to be Guido.[43]Red Hulk fought against Guido and managed to convince Guido to abandon the position of Hell Lord and try to regain his lost soul, allowing Mephisto to regain the throne and let the Thunderbolts return to Earth. Red Hulk offered Guido the opportunity to return with them, but he preferred to stay until he could regain his soul.[44]\nAt some point Guido's soul was restored with help fromMagik.[45]He returned to Earth, where he assisted the X-Men in their assault onNew Attilan,[46]and later joined his fellow mutants - including former teammates Rictor andShatterstar- inNew Tian.[47]\nTogether with Magik, Boom-Boom, Prodigy, and former teammates Rictor and Wolfsbane, he began working forKarma, who hired them to investigate paranormal activities and hunt for her brotherTran.[48]Guido struggled with what he had done without his soul, especially murderingRahne's son. While Rahne initially wanted nothing to do with him, she eventually forgave him after he tearfully broke down upon seeing a vision of the murder.[49]\nLater, he and the New Mutants joinedCyclopsand Wolverine to form the newest incarnation of the X-Men. When Cyclops and Wolverine raided a prison to free all of its mutant prisoners, dupes of Multiple Man blew up. Guido was able to protect everyone by absorbing the energy of the explosion, but the strain on his body proved fatal. He collapsed and died looking at Magik.[10]\nKinetic Energy Absorption:Guido possesses a unique ability that allows him to absorb kinetic energy. This power manifests when he straining/flexing his body as he takes damage, if the damage is sufficient, thus increasing his muscle mass. However, there is a limitation to this power as he can only retain the absorbed energy for a maximum of 90 seconds. If Guido exceeds this time limit, his body will remain in that strengthened size permanently, also most likely dying from a heart attack due to his weak heart. He offsets this risk by directing the acquired energy into his attacks, emanating vibrant waves of green energy from his fists. Each strike gradually reduces him back to normal size, yet amplifies his already formidable attacks as he does so. Notably, Guido faces a risky trade-off; while he can amass energy endlessly, the choice to unleash it all at once in a single devastating blow could be lethal for his opponents, overpowering even the most resilient foes with sheer force.\nCatching She-Hulk by surprise"

Taking his attacking them as evidence that he is not the \"real\" Cable,WarpathandBoom Boomlunge at him as Cable insists that they are forcing his hand, and Marvel Girl suddenly sends out a telekinetic attack that freezes everyone in the air. She demands that Cable tell her who he is and what he is doing, starting with why he killed his future self. Cable says he killed him because he was neglecting his duty to preserving the timeline because he had become attached to the time-displacedX-Menand allowed them to remain in the present despite knowing the risks. He elaborates that Ahab is trying to kill the youngIceman, which would create ripple effect resulting in mutant extermination. To prove his honesty, Cable removes his telepathy blocker so Marvel Girl can read his mind. She enters his mind to find a future where the X-Men are not whole and gradually lose more battles until mutantkind has been exterminated, all because the time-displaced X-Men refused to return to their own time. Marvel Girl releases the other mutants from her telekinesis and Cable further explains that he stoleMimic's wings (genetically identical toAngel's) so Angel could return to the past with his original wings and preserve the timeline.\nIn Searebro, the adult Jean Grey watches overCyclopswhenHoney Badgerreports to her that Ahab's ship is coming.

Jean and several other barricade themselves inside the medical bay where a brainwashedNightcrawlerteleports inside to kill Cyclops, but he is shot by a tranquilizer bullet fired by Cable, who Marvel Girl and the former X-Force have reluctantly allied themselves with.

When hismutantseismic powers manifested, Julio accidentally destroyed three city blocks. This brought Julio to the attention ofThe Right, an anti-mutant organization, who kidnapped him. Dubbing himRictor, they explained his mutation to him, tortured him, and attempted to force Rictor into using his seismic powers to destroySan Francisco, while claiming to be allied with the mutant terrorists, X-Terminators,X-Factor's alter egos. Thankfully, Rictor was saved by X-Factor and accepted their invitation to join as a trainee member, at theX-Factor Complex.[14]\nWhile training at the Complex, Rictor was among the first to notice X-Factor PR man,Cameron Hodge's devious acts, as he noticed that Hodge's voice matched that of the leader of The Right.[15]After X-Factor battledApocalypse'sHorsemen, inCentral Park,Rusty Collinsdecided to melt the mountain of ice thatIcemanhad used to subdue the villains, and Rictor fist-fought Rusty, worried that his powers may get out of control and do more harm than good. When Rusty left anyway, Rictor saved Rusty from a gang and he and Rusty worked together to melt the ice and leave a message: \"By Their Deeds You Shall Know Them - Mutants Were Here\".[16]The children of X-Factor were captured by The Right and Rictor was again to be used as a weapon.

After the children were given Christmas gifts as donations, they decided to give them to the children who lost their homes during X-Factor's battle.[18]While sleeping, X-Factor and the kids were attacked by Ship, still under the control of Apocalypse, until Rusty freed its consciousness and X-Factor expelled a bomb. Ship, now able to speak, asked to join them. Ship had complete control over every part of its structure and could fashion rooms, weapons, and vehicles as needed from various storehouses and parts it had. Ship was able to design and run training programs for X-Factor, as well as make living quarters and workshop areas for them.[19]While playing around on Ship, the students ran intoBeast, who was going over old photos of X-Factor in their teens and revealed their origins, as the originalX-Menand students at theXavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.[20]After Iceman was tricked byInfectiato allow her on Ship, Beast attempted to warn Iceman, who was being seduced by her, but due to Beast's lack of intelligence, Iceman couldn't understand him and the students kept her from kissing Iceman.[21]When theXartansandLord Zano, inAvengersdisguise, attacked X-Factor, the children were protected by Ship, but later aided X-Factor.[22]After finding that they were going to be sent to a private school,Marvel Girland Iceman took the kids shopping for clothes, where they were attacked by theAlliance of Evil. After defeating the Alliance of Evil,Freedom Forceshowed-up and ordered Rusty and X-Factor to register, to which X-Factor accepted and Rusty turned himself into the Navy.[23]\nAfter seeing Rusty off at a Naval base,Skids, Boom-Boom, and Rictor were enrolled at Phillips Academy, in Exeter,New Hampshire. After a cold reception from the other students of the academy, the students were awakened in their dorms byTakeshi Matsuya (Wiz Kid), informing them thatArtie MaddicksandLeechhad been kidnapped by demons. After leaving the dorms, the students rescued Rusty from his prison and began the search for Artie and Leech.[24]After stopping to get new outfits, Rictor suggested the nameX-Terminatorsfor the group, to honor X-Factor, and the group was attacked by demons who kidnappedTaki. Following a mental image from Artie, the X-Terminators battled an invasion of demons.[25]After being captured by the demons, the X-Terminators were teleported toTimes Square, where the New MutantMagikwas opening a portal to return her teammates from the demon infested dimension ofLimbo. The demonN'astirhkept the portal open usingten kidnapped mutant infants, one of them beingNathan Summers, as the points of an inverted pentagram. The infants provided strong focusing beams of power because of their purity and openness to use them as natural, living conduits who could not block the flow of power, and who would not know how to shut it off.[26][27]\nAfter Artie and Leech freed the X-Terminators, they battled the horde of demons that flowed out of the portal and, afterCannonballrescued Rusty and Skids, joined the New Mutants in rescuing the infants being used to keep the portal open. Rusty suggested that the X-Terminators rescue their teammate, Taki, while the New Mutants continued to rescue the infants and disrupt the pentagram. After rescuing Taki, Julio joined the New Mutants as they began searching for the demonic Magik.[27]\nWhile searching for theDarkchildethroughout the city, Rictor and the New Mutants witnessedMagneto, the New Mutants new headmaster, and theInner Circleof theHellfire Clubmeeting with N'astirh and lost all trust in him. The New Mutants, Boom-Boom, and Rictor found Darkchilde battling the demon,S'ym, at the same time her brother, the X-ManColossus, appeared. Colossus was shocked to see his Little Snowflake in such a state and Darkchilde was embarrassed and teleported away, taking the young heroes with her to Limbo, where she finally decided to stop running from her responsibilities as the ruler of Limbo. Unwilling to lose her friend and teammate,Wolfsbane, jumped into a teleportation disc and found the youngerIllyana Rasputinand delivered her before the Darkchilde. Darkchilde emerged from her armor and began to glow of pure light, attempting to kill her younger self, but Wolfsbane stopped her, stating that saving the young Illyana would bring peace to the older Darkchilde. Darkchilde found a way to stop Inferno, although she knew it risked her no longer existing. Darkchilde opened a tremendous portal and sucked all of the remaining demons back to Limbo. Burning so bright with energy, that it hurt to look at her, the Lightchilde hurled herSoulswordinto the air and the demons were banished, leaving only the charred remains of her eldritch armor. Colossus cradled the badly damaged armor and heard someone call his name from inside. Opening the armor, Colossus found Illyana had returned to her natural age of a seven year old girl.[28]\nThe X-Terminators and New Mutants returned to X-Factor's Ship, with the mutant babies andGosamyr.[29]Due to his actions during the demonic invasion, Julio was expelled from Phillips Academy and, while the New Mutants returned home and X-Factor attended funerals, the X-Terminators found anAtlanteanhorn and accidentally called forth a giant sea creature. The New Mutants returned and, with the aid ofNamor the Submariner, they defeated it. After the creature's defeat, X-Factor returned and the New Mutants began to live on Ship, merging with the X-Terminators asProfessor X'smansionhad been destroyed.[30]The all-new New Mutants team returned Illyana to her home in Ust-Ordynski Collective,Siberia, with her parents. On their return home,MirageandBrightwind, her winged horse, became ill with a mystical fever. Unaware of how to save Mirage, Ship suggested that the New Mutants go toDr. Strangeto help her. After arriving at theSanctum Sanctorum, the New Mutants were startled to learn that Dr. Strange was apparently \"dead\" and they were attacked by a possessed, inflamed Mirage and Brightwind. Mirage reasserted control and Dr. Strange, disguised as \"Dr. Sanders\", returned all that her body had damaged to normal.[31]While returning Mirage and Brightwind to Ship, the New Mutants were attacked byFreedom Force(government-chartered mutant enforcers composed of former members of theBrotherhood of Evil Mutants), believing Rusty caused all of the flames. The battle between the New Mutants and Freedom Force awoke Mirage and Brightwind and Ship suddenly warped-off into space with X-Factor. After Rusty and Skids learned that the government never returned the infants to their parents, Dr. Strange teleported the remaining New Mutants toAsgard.[32]\nAfter arriving in Asgard, the New Mutants realized that Ship had been sent to theNegative ZoneandDani Moonstarleft them. After being captured byDwarves, the New Mutants were released and joined them, due to Cannonball's relationship withEitri, king of the Dwarves.[33]\nAs part of the New Mutants, Rictor helped battleMystique'sFreedom Force,Hela, and former allyCaliban, who had become theHorsemanDeath, andSabretoothwhile battling in theMorlock tunnelsunderNew York City. Rictor was severely injured by Sabretooth, but was saved byCableand the other New Mutants.[34]\nDuring this time, Rictor first became interested in his teammateWolfsbane, which in turn made Boom Boom extremely jealous.\nRictor was later captured alongsideStorm, Boom Boom, Wolfsbane, andWarlockby forces of the island nationGenosha. Only he and Boom Boom escaped unscathed. The combined efforts of the X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants led to him being freed. During this adventure, Rictor shared a heartfelt kiss with Wolfsbane and was later heartbroken when she chose to stay behind.[35][36][37]\nRunning with X-Force\nAfter the business in Genosha, Rictor left the New Mutants with the intent of reuniting with Wolfsbane back on Genosha.[38]Unable to find Wolfsbane, Rictor joined theCanadian government'sWeapon P.R.I.M.E. team,[39]whose sole purpose was the apprehension of Cable. At this time, Rictor was still convinced that Cable was the man who killed his father when Stryfe, Cable's evil clone, was actually his father's murder.[40]\nAfter Rictor learned the truth about his father's death, he rejoined his friends in the New Mutants, now formed into the paramilitary teamX-Force. Almost immediately after joining X-Force, Rictor and his new teammates were captured by the X-Men and X-Factor who were seeking Cable for the attempted murder ofProfessor X; an act that had also been perpetrated by Stryfe. Cable was eventually cleared of the charges and Rictor continued on with X-Force where he first metShatterstar. Shatterstar and Rictor formed a close friendship that developed into a secret romance.[41][42]\nWith X-Force, Rictor battledWar Machineon boardGraymalkinand saved his teammates fromGideonand theExternals. After Rictor helped Shatterstar through a personal crisis, the pair left X-Force to travel toMexicoand put an end to the Richter family gun-smuggling business.[43][44][45]\nRictor would later be one of several former members of X-Force who joined Professor X's restructuredX-Corporation. Rictor was located in theParisX-Corp center and participated in X-Corporation's confrontation withWeapon XII, which was a total catastrophe and led to the death of one of their members,Darkstar.[46]It is unclear if Rictor left X-Corp before or after it disbanded followingM-Day.[47][8]\nAfter losing his powers onM-Day, Rictor battled with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Once, he was found byMultiple Manon the edge of a building ready to jump and end his life. Wanting to help his friend, Jamie sent one of his dupes to talk to Rictor. After chatting for some time, the dupe managed to get through to Rictor and he changed his mind about ending his life. However, as he was about to get away from the edge, the dupe pushed him, revealing his unstable personality.[8]Luckily for Rictor,Monet St. Croixarrived at that exact instant and caught him midair.[2]Afterwards, Rictor accepted Jamie's offer to join his detective agency inMutant Town,X-Factor Investigations, which Monet was also a part of.[48]\nSaved by Monet\nWhenQuicksilverarrived to Mutant Town, Rictor started hanging out with him, hoping to get his powers back.[49]Later, Quicksilver offered his aid to theX-Cell, a group believing the U.S. government to be behind theDecimation.[50]He then kidnapped Rictor and lured him into working as a siphon for his power, through which he attempted to restore mutantkind.[51]Most X-Cell members briefly regained their powers through this method by the time X-Factor made their ambush. When Rictor realized Quicksilver was wrong, he used his powers against him and blasted theTerrigen Crystalsthrough his body, leaving him powerless.[52]Residual crystals embedded in Rictor's skin afforded him immunity toThe Isolationist's many mutant powers.[53]\nAfter the birth of the first human child since M-Day, Rictor was assigned to infiltrate thePurifiers, which was easy with his depowered status.[54]He was able to gain credibility with the Purifiers by \"shooting\" Wolfsbane as she was attacking a group of them in New York.[4]It didn't take long for him to complete his mission and learn they didn't have the child. After theNew X-Menattacked their compound, he managed to calmPixieand get her to teleport everyone away. After this, he was telepathically reached byEmma Frostand told her about his findings.[55][56]\nRictor andWolfsbane's romantic relationship had intensified during their time together in X-Factor.[57]However, their romance ended when Rahne suddenly left X-Factor to joinWolverine's black-opsX-Force team.[58][59]\nEnraged that he had only been left a letter by Rahne, Rictor decided to quit as well, but was kidnapped by the X-Men villainArcadebefore he had the chance. Arcade had been hired byMr. Taylor, the purifier who had accepted Rictor into the organization, and was now looking for revenge against him for ruining his reputation. After hearing Mr. Taylor's reports, however, Arcade had decided to go bigger and act his revenge on the whole of Mutant Town. He had also spread several bombs and placed a disintegration grid surrounding Mutant Town, preventing everyone from getting in or out. In the end, X-Factor managed to shut the grid down, but they were unable to save Mutant Town, as it was destroyed by Arcade's bombs. In the aftermath of the event,Val Coopertried to recruit the team, but they decided to escape and relocate toDetroit,Michigan.[60]\nWhile searching for Madrox, Rictor andStrong Guydiscovered adupe of Madrox's had been living in New England as a priest. They decided to investigate further, hoping to find the whereabouts of Madrox Prime. Upon meeting Father Maddox, a masked man crashed through the window with swords ablaze. After a brief battle, the attacker was revealed to beShatterstar, possessed byunknown forces. Once Shatterstar was broken out of his trance-like state,[61]and recognized Rictor, the two embraced one another and finally shared a kiss.[42]\nRictor and Shatterstar kissing\nRictor and Shatterstar began a steady romantic relationship after Shatterstar's return though not without its difficulties. Rictor, having finally come to terms with his sexual identity, wanted a stable monogamous relationship with Shatterstar. Shatterstar, on the other hand, found himself interested in a more open relationship that would allow him to explore other sexual possibilities. The two resolved that they would work things out, and proceeded to make up both emotionally and physically. However, before they could get very far, the two were interrupted when a pregnant Wolfsbane barged in.[62]\nWolfsbane was pregnant withHrimhari's child, although she led Rictor and the others to believe he was the father.[63]This lie did not last long as a brief encounter between Hrimhari and Shatterstar inNiffleheimcleared up the question of paternity.[64]\nAlthough initially upset about Rahne's deception, Rictor promised to stand by her and offer any aid he could.[65]Later, Rictor and the rest of the X-Factor Investigations crew helped protect Rahne from several lupine and felinedemonscoming for the baby before the birth.[66]\nRictor's powers restored\nWhenWanda Maximoffwas rescued by theYoung Avengers,Beastasked her if she would be able to reverse the effects ofM-Dayby undoing the spell she had cast. Hoping to confirm his theory,Jessica Jonescalled in X-Factor Investigations, hoping one of its former mutant members would be willing to participate. Rictor accepted her offer. Wanda's attempt to undo the spell succeeded and his powers were restored.[9][67]\nAfter the birth and abandonment ofRahne's son, she remained with X-Factor but fell into a depression. BecausePolarisandBansheebrought Wolfsbane to Rev. Madrox for grief counseling, she decided to find her son.[68]Both Rictor and Shatterstar volunteered (unsolicited) to accompany her.[69]The trio first traveled toHeland received a mystic amulet to locate the child. The trio finally found him inSproul State ForestinPennsylvania. Unfortunately, he was being tracked independently by bothDarwinandVanora. They evaded the attacks and escaped without harm. Once reunited with her son, Wolfsbane chose to leave X-Factor and raise him with the aid and protection ofJack Russell, the Werewolf by Night.[70]Shatterstar and Rictor returned to X-Factor Investigation in New York City.[71]\nAfter Rahne and her son, Tier, returned to X-Factor to seek sanctuary from Darwin and other would-be assassins, all of X-Factor were transported toHell. TheHell Lordsvied to gain overall control by killing Tier, and X-Factor fought their demon armies to protect him. When Shatterstar attackedMephistoto free Tier from a magical prison, Mephisto seemingly vaporized him, before doing the same to Rictor.[72]\nIn fact, Rictor and Shatterstar both ended up going back in time and being transported to theMojoverse. Rictor fought gladiatorial battles until he was pitted against Shatterstar. Rictor incapacitated Shatterstar and managed to escape the arena with Mojoverse rebels, including the Longshot of this era. Shatterstar was then cloned byArize, before he awoke and used his powers to transport himself and Rictor forward in time, escaping an attack byMojoandSpiral. In this new time period, Rictor came acrossDazzlergiving birth to Shatterstar as a baby. Rictor and Shatterstar helped to deliver the baby, before Shatterstar erased Dazzler's memory. Shatterstar then transported himself, Rictor, and himself as a baby forward in time again - by 100 years.[73]\nRictor and Shatterstar somehow made it back to Earth and their own time and joined their fellow mutants - including former teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane - inNew Tian. Rictor was among the mutants that confrontedDaisy Johnsonand a group of Inhumans when they tried to sneak into the country.[74]\nAfter New Tian was dismantled, Rictor attendedIceman's going away party in New York and revealed that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.[75]Bobby and Julio went on a date together but soon realized that they were both too hung up on their exes. The date was interrupted when Bobby's mother called about a mutant neighbor whose powers were going berserk. The two of them helped him calm down and then brought him to the institute.[76]\nJulio joined up with many of his former teammates as the New Mutants led byMagik. Together they investigated paranormal occurrences for theHatchi Corporation.[77]Back together with Shatterstar, Rictor shared a brunch with him, Wolfsbane, and Boom Boom before being transported by Magik to October Revolution Island, Russia.[78]\nAfter breaking up with Shatterstar, again, and then moving out of his building, Manor Crossing, Julio opened a mutant friendly gay club called The Shakedown[79]Through the club he ran \"an underground railroad of sorts for runaway mutants.\"[80]\nWhen Shatterstar's tenants were kidnapped he went to Rictor for help finding them. Using Rictor as an \"anchor\" for teleportation they were able to find the kidnappers. Together they fought them and afterward shared a kiss. However, when Julio wanted to join him, Shatterstar refused and instead sent him somewhere he'd be safe.[80]The two were later reunited when Julio found him using his powers to detect Shatterstar's vibrations, caused by his own powers, by reaching across the universe.[81]\nIn the reality created byNate Greyand aLife Seed, a world where everyone on Earth was a mutant and relationships were strongly discouraged or illegal, Rictor was the proprietor of an independent theater.\nHe and his theater came under scrutiny fromDepartment Xafter it came to their attention that Rictor showed films encouraging love and relationships. Friend and Department X investigatorNorthstarvolunteered to investigate the matter solo. Rictor, despite Northstar's warning, was nonchalant about Department X's interest in the theater.Icemanshowed up soon after, having opted to follow Northstar to the theater out of concern for his well being. This infuriated Northstar who demanded that Iceman butt out. Sensing the tension between the two, Rictor invited them up to the roof to drink with him. After several hours of drinking, Rictor passed out on Iceman, while Iceman and Northstar had a heart to heart. An explosion occurred soon after in front of the theater, instigated byJubilee, who offered the three of them to join her in rioting over their stolen and slowly-returning memories. Rictor and the others happily accepted.[82]\nWhen the mutant nation ofKrakoawas created, most of the world's mutants joined it and Rictor intended to do so as well. However, due to his powers going haywire, he was unable to step out of his house and spent his time at home.[83]\nRictor finally came to Krakoa when Apocalypse, who needed Rictor's abilities, went to get him. Initially, Rictor refused to go fearing he would break the island in half, but Apocalypse told him not to worry, there was no place for depression in Krakoa, and if he broke anything Apocalypse would fix it. They entered aKrakoan Gatewaythat took them to theKrakoan habitatinCornwall, after arriving they were met byPete Wisdomwho was there looking forCaptain Britain.[83]\nRictor joined Excalibur. With Gambit, he was sent by Apocalypse to retrieve crystals needed for opening theOtherworldPortal. There, they meet the druids, who claim that Rictor was a druid as well.[12][84]\nAfter being attacked by the White Priestess of Saturnyne, the Green Priestesses captured Shogo and Jubilee. Excalibur attacked the Green Priestesses hoping to save them, but realised that the Green Priestesses meant them no harm. They were given a place to rest for the night. Unable to sleep, Rictor wandered into the forest, where he stumbled into the \"heart of (the priestesses') home\". He touched the crystal planted there, which amplified his psychic reception, allowing Apocalypse to talk to him.[85]\nThe next day, Excalibur stormed the citadel, planting a Krakoan Gate on citadel grounds. Rictor went through the gate, only for the gate to malfunction as it was not powered by crystals. As he fell, Rictor communicated with Apocalypse psychically and acted as an anchor for Apocalypse in Krakoa. Apocalypse gathered the Externals to undergo a ritual, intending to sacrifice them for the energy in their bones in order to establish the External Gate. With magma, Rictor killed the Externals.[86]\nWhen theSummonerandBansheereturned through the External Gate from Otherworld with dire news of invasion by the forces ofAmenth, Rictor was among those that travelled through to assess the situation and defend Krakoa, as it was revealed the External Gate also allowed passage for non-mutants. The situation was revealed to be a trap, however. Betrayed by the Summoner, Rictor and his fellow mutants had to defend against overwhelming force before retreating afterLady Saturnynefroze everyone in place and called for a tournament between sword-wielders to take place instead of open warfare. Rictor was carried back to Krakoa, where he succumbed to his injuries before being resurrected by theFive.[10]\nAfter Apocalypse joined his wife Genesis in Amenth, he left all his items to Rictor.[87]Later, at theHellfire Gala, Rictor was reunited withShatterstarand crowned king of Britain's druids.[88][89]WhenExcaliburagain journeyed into Otherworld to investigate a brewing war, Rictor and Shatterstar (seemingly back together) accompanied.[5]\nRictor explaining his connection toEarth\nRictor was amutantwho lost hispowersdue to the effects ofM-Day.[47][8]He was briefly repowered byQuicksilver'sTerrigenesis, but lost powers again to defeat Pietro.[91]He was later completely repowered by the personal intervention of theScarlet Witch.[9]His power created apsychic/empathic bondbetween Julio and the primal life force of theEarth's biosphere.[8]It allows him to manipulate various energies and forces of the planet itself, enabling him to connect with and control plants,[92]lava,[93]earth,[12]and seismic energy at will.[94][14][45]"

It's assumed it was here he developed his strong sense of honor and pride as a warrior, to combat the constant violence and death in his life.\nDuring his time in the arenas, Shatterstar formed a relationship withGringrave, a popular female gladiator commonly known as the Smiling Executioner. Gringrave manipulated Shatterstar for her own ends, teaching him not to love or get attached to others, and live only for the thrill of the kill.[14][15]\nEventually, Shatterstar grew disillusioned with the idea of killing for sport. He escaped and joined the Blood Cadre Alliance, the rebel group that sought to overthrowMojo V's dictatorship. From there, he learned the Cadre's language and began taking part in missions, one of which sent him back in time to find the X-Men and get their assistance in defeating Mojo.[16]\nWith X-Force\nInstead of finding the X-Men, Shatterstar was transported back in time to Earth at the point just before Cable reorganized theNew MutantsintoX-Force. WithCable's assurance that they would help him defeat Mojo, Shatterstar became a founding member of the new team.[17]X-Force was also where he first metRictor. Shatterstar and Rictor formed a close friendship. Shatterstar learned Spanish specifically to communicate privately with Rictor.[18]After an awkward trip to a nightclub, Shatterstar also confessed to Ric that he wasn't emotionally prepared for physical interaction, due to his upbringing on Mojoworld. Rictor vowed to help Star with his development.[19]\nLater Shatterstar discovered, to his bewilderment, that he also had the memories of an Earthling namedBenjamin Russell.[8]Soon afterwards, Mojo made Cable and Shatterstar his prisoners and transformed them into digital images for one of his television programs. In the course of the show, Shatterstar was mortally wounded in combat. Mojo's sometime allySpiralteleported Cable and Shatterstar back into reality, where they regained their true forms. Spiral brought Cable, Shatterstar, Longshot, and the X-Force memberSirynto theWeisman Institute for the Criminally InsaneinRutland,Vermont.[citation needed]\nThere Spiral directed them to the bedside of one of its patients, a mutant named Benjamin Russell who had no living relatives, had been in a coma since his powers had emerged, and, curiously, looked identical to Shatterstar. Longshot transferred Shatterstar's \"uemeur,\" or soul, into Benjamin Russell's body, and the two became one. Apparently Shatterstar's body merged with Russell's as well, for the resulting body bore the starburst pattern that Shatterstar had around his left eye and his hair lengthened greatly. Restored to full health and consciousness, and feeling \"whole\" for the first time in his life, Shatterstar resumed his work as a member of X-Force.[20]\nShatterstar accompanied Rictor to the Richter home inMexicoto try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business.[21][22]Presumably they succeeded, though it's not known why they later parted.\nShatterstar was later inMadripoor, earning his money by fighting in arenas. He was sought out by Spiral, who had one of her agents make Shatterstar believe she wanted to kill him. With a fake quest, Spiral lured Shatterstar to an alternate universe she had conquered and ruled. On that Earth, Spiral had also killed most of that worlds heroes and mutants. That Earth's Shatterstar had been killed as well. He was found by that Earth's rebel forces, including Cable and some others he knew from X-Force. Together, they eventually defeated Spiral.[23]Upon returning to the mainstream Earth, Shatterstar was contacted by Cable, who requested that Shatterstar temporarily join him on a mission to defeat theSkornn. Shatterstar agreed, but first Cable wanted him to train with monks on Mount Xixabangma. After those monks were killed by Skornn's worshipers, Shatterstar was reunited with his old team and they eventually killed the Skornn.[24]\nFollowingM-Dayand the passing of theSuperhuman Registration Act, Shatterstar teamed up with former X-Force alliesDominoandCalibanto breakThe 198out of the encampment set up for mutants on the grounds of theXavier Institute. They took the escapees to a secret base provided to them byCaptain AmericaviaNick Fury. While fightingO*N*Ehe nearly killedMicromax, claiming that while there is no such thing as murder during war, he had only meant to disable him.[25]\nAt some unknown point,Cortexgained control over Shatterstar and sent him to attack his friends. While searching for Madrox, Rictor andStrong GuydiscoveredFather Maddox, a dupe of Madrox's, that had been living in New England as a priest. They decided to investigate further, hoping to find the whereabouts of Madrox Prime. Upon meeting Father Maddox, a masked man crashed through the window with swords ablaze. After a brief battle, the attacker was revealed to be Shatterstar, possessed by Cortex.[26]\nRictor and Shatterstar kissing\nOnce Shatterstar was broken out of his trance-like state, and recognized Rictor, the two embraced one another and finally shared a kiss.[27]\nShortly afterwards Shatterstar transported X-Factor toLatveria, where he remained withLayla MillerandDoctor Doomfor a while.[28]Layla and Shatterstar next appeared atDublin Airportto saveTerry CassidyfromTrask'sMutant Response Division.[29]After they escaped, the trio rejoined the rest of X-Factor back in New York City.[30]\nRictor and Shatterstar began a steady romantic relationship after Shatterstar's return though not without its difficulties. Rictor, having finally come to terms with his sexual identity, wanted a stable monogamous relationship with Shatterstar. Shatterstar, on the other hand, found himself interested in a more open relationship that would allow him to explore other sexual possibilities. The two resolved that they would work things out, and proceeded to make up both emotionally and physically. However, before they could get very far, the two were interrupted when a pregnantWolfsbanebarged in.[5]\nWolfsbane was pregnant withHrimhari's child, although she led Rictor and the others to believe he was the father.[31]This lie did not last long as a brief encounter between Hrimhari and Shatterstar inNiffleheimcleared up the question of paternity.[32]\nAfter the birth and abandonment ofWolfsbane's son, Shatterstar and Rictor volunteered (unsolicited) to accompany Wolfsbane in searching for her child.[33]The trio first traveled toHeland receive a mystic amulet to locate the child, and finally found him inSproul State ForestinPennsylvania. Wolfsbane's son,Tier, was being tracked independently by bothDarwinandVanorabut Shatterstar and Rictor were able to fight off attacks from both, and Tier escaped unharmed with his mother. Wolfsbane then chose to leave X-Factor and raise Tier with the aid and protection ofJack Russell, the Werewolf By Night.[34]Shatterstar and Rictor, however, returned to X-Factor Investigations in New York City.[35]\nAfter Rahne and her son, Tier, returned to X-Factor to seek sanctuary from Darwin and other would-be assassins, all of X-Factor were transported toHell. TheHell Lordsvied to gain overall control by killing Tier, and X-Factor fought their demon armies to protect him. When Shatterstar attackedMephistoto free Tier from a magical prison, Mephisto seemingly vaporised him, before doing the same to Rictor.[36]\nIn fact, Rictor and Shatterstar both ended up going back in time and being transported to theMojoverse. Shatterstar was again brainwashed into attacking Rictor - this time in a televised gladiatorial battle. Rictor managed to incapacitate Shatterstar, before escaping the arena with help from Mojoverse rebels, including the Longshot of this era. Whilst he was unconscious, Shatterstar was brought toArize, who cloned him (and used some of his DNA to create Longshot). Shatterstar awoke in time to use his powers to escape an attack byMojoandSpiral, and Shatterstar transported them forward in time. In this new time period, Rictor came acrossDazzlergiving birth to Shatterstar as a baby. Rictor and Shatterstar helped to deliver the baby, before Shatterstar erased Dazzler's memory. To maintain the timeline as it was meant to take place, Shatterstar then transported himself, Rictor, and his infant self forward in time again - by 100 years - to the period he grew up in.[13]\nShatterstar and Rictor somehow made it back to Earth and their own time, and joined their fellow mutants - including former teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane - inNew Tian.[37]After New Tian was dismantled, Rictor told Iceman that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.[38]\nShatterstar rejoined the X-Men in New York to investigate signs that thePhoenix Forcemight have returned to Earth, checking the Manhattan sewers in a team with Dazzler and Strong Guy.[39]\nRictor and Shatterstar try to navigate their newly separated status\nFeeling unsure about himself and his relationship with Rictor, Shatterstar ended things between them.[40]Newly single, Shatterstar bought a property using the earnings he'd made and named it Manor Crossing. He offered the rooms to multi-dimensional refugees like himself and served as both landlord and protector to his tenants. When Shatterstar's tenants were kidnapped by the Mojoworld mercenary group theDeath Sponsorsand their leader, former allyGringrave, Shatterstar vowed to bring them home.[7]\nWith help from Rictor, Shatterstar followed the group to the world of Horus IV, which was ruled by theGrandmaster. Grandmaster tasked Gringrave with the kidnapping, hoping to use a gladiatorial battle between the enemies to satisfy the Horuvians lust for bloody conflict.[40]\nAfter Shatterstar killed Gringrave in revenge for her actions,[15]Grandmaster himself entered the arena, seeking to gain control of Shatterstar for all eternity. But Shatterstar refused to concede and defeated Grandmaster by teleporting them toEarth-1218, a world where super-powered beings do not exist and Grandmaster's god powers could not work. Shatterstar was then rescued by Rictor, who reached out across the universe to find him and bring him home.[41]\nShatterstar was shocked when his former mentor Cable was slain while attempting to protect the time-displaced Iceman.[42]When it was revealed that a younger version of Cable was responsible, Shatterstar partnered with his former X-Force teammates to hunt downKid Cableand have him answer for his crime. During the search, Shatterstar was turned into one ofAhab's mutant-hunting hounds and attempted to kill the time-displaced Jean Grey.[43]Shatterstar was subdued by Cannonball and freed of Ahab's influence.[44]\nAfter Kid Cable returned the time-displaced X-Men to their timeline and disappeared, Shatterstar joined a newly reformed X-Force to resume their search for him. They found Kid Cable in the small nation ofTransia, working withDeathlokto uncover how the country's military had gotten ahold of weapons from Kid Cable's future. Shatterstar and his team were forced to team up with Kid Cable when they were framed for the murder of the Transian president.[45]\nShatterstar struggled to trust Kid Cable and accept him as the real Nathan Summers,[46]but the pair worked together with the rest of X-Force to defeat the Transian military. They learned the military's futuristic weapons were being supplied byStryfethrough a time portal.[47]Strye took Kid Cable into the future through the portal and X-Force resolved to rescue both him and the kidnappedRachel Summers. Shatterstar was prepared to give his life for the potentially one-way mission, feeling like there was little left for him since Rictor's presumed death.[48]\nX-Force defeated Stryfe, rescued both Kid Cable and Rachel Summers, and found a way to return to their timeline. Shatterstar finally declared his trust in Kid Cable and forgave him for murdering the older Cable. Shatterstar also resolved to return to the present, stop seeking distractions, and instead focus on grieving Rictor properly.[49]\nShatterstar was of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation ofKrakoaupon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.[50]\nAt some point, Shatterstar returned to Mojoworld, becoming the dimension's most subscribed and top-ranked live-streamer. However, Shatterstar began to feel trapped by the celebrity status he had created for himself. When fellow live-streamerWind Dancerarranged for her own death to satisfy her fans, Shatterstar secretly informed the KrakoanX-Factorteam so they could claim her body beforeArizecould produce a clone and force Wind Dancer to resume her stream. X-Factor were successful in their mission, but had to leave Shatterstar behind in Mojoworld. They promised to one day return and rescue him.[51]The team eventually made good on this promise coming back alongside the New Mutants and arranging the freedom of all mutants there. After this they recruited Shatterstar to defeatThe Morrigan, freeingSirynfrom her control.[52]He was then rewarded with memories of his past, which lead to him seeking Rictor out during the Hellfire Gala,[53]after which they sat on the coastline of the newly created Braddock Isle and caught up with one another.[54]\nReunited with Rictor, Shatterstar joinedExcaliburin their battle againstKing ArthurinOtherworld.[55]He became one ofCaptain Britain'sKnights of Xand helped her to liberate Otherworld.[56]\nShatterstar is a mutant,[58]the naturally born son of the mutant Dazzler and the artificially-engineered Biped Longshot.[13]As a result, he was born with many of the superhuman traits Longshot was engineered to possess, in addition to his own unique mutant abilities. Shatterstar also merged withBenjamin Russell, with whom he shares an unexplained connection. Russell was also reportedly a mutant.[59]Russell's mutant powers are unknown, but Shatterstar did not appear to gain or lose any abilities when the two merged. Although his teleporting ability surfaced after he bonded with Russell, the two events happened 13 years apart and were not noticeably connected.[60]"

Little did most know, his mutant ability enhanced his physical appearance, lending a hand to his confidence and propelling him swiftly into the limelight.[2]\nRecruited by national security agencyF.I.6after the emergence of his powers, gaining the codenamed Micromax. While on stakeout following a series of museum thefts, , Micromax found himself assigned to protect a collection of Druid artifacts scattered across various locations. During surveillance at Arfurs Antiques, Micromax mistakenly targetedPhoenixfromExcalibur, believing her to be the thief, unaware that she was battling an invisible creature who servedNecrom.[5]This confusion repeated at the Major Mainwaring Museum, where the invisible assailant struck again, leading to a skirmish between Micromax andNightcrawler's team, theTechnet. In his final attempt at the Brum-Art Gallery, Micromax was caught off guard by the invisible thief, knocked unconscious by a hefty wooden crate. Despite the assailant's attempt to flee with a silver headband, the Technet intervened, revealing the thief to be a brain-dead pawn. Though the Technet emerged victorious, Micromax faced criticism from his supervisor,Brigadier Inky Blott, for yet another underwhelming performance.[6]\nSeveral days later, the F.I.6 ESP unit managed to trace the perpetrator's whereabouts near derelict warehouses in London’s docklands. Preferring not to take any risks, F.I.6 mobilized a significant force to apprehend him. Due to Micromax's previous shortcomings, Inky hesitated to deploy him immediately, opting to keep him on standby nearby. With dread, Scott watched from the sidelines as the hidden figure, Necrom, drained the life force of every person present, saving Micromax for last, blaming him for the demise of his enslaved creature. Just as Necrom reached out to him, Micromax swiftly shrank to his smallest size, but the rapid reduction caused him to black out. Upon awakening, Micromax found himself with CommanderDai Thomasandhis team on the scene. He briefed them on Necrom's abilities before joining Dai on a helicopter bound for theBraddock Lighthouse.[7]Upon arrival, they discovered Necrom locked in combat with members of Excalibur. Determined to redeem himself, Scott directed the chopper to hover above the fray and then leapt out, enlarging himself mid-air to strike Necrom with the force of a falling meteor. Despite the impact, Necrom remained alive and turned his attention to Micromax. A timely intervention from Excalibur spared Micromax from Necrom’s grasp momentarily. However, Necrom managed to flee towards the Lighthouse, aiming to access themultiverse. Micromax and his newfound allies could only watch as Necrom clashed with Rachel Summers over the power of thePhoenix Force, culminating in the explosion of his entire being.[8]\nFollowing Brigadier Blott's demise, the remaining resources of F.I.6. were eventually integrated into the British intelligence groupR.C.X.. Although Scott had no interest in joining their ranks, he was designated as the U.K. delegate for the inaugural Pan-European Conference on Super Human Affairs. However, like many other European heroes in attendance, he fell victim to the hypnotic influence of the former Nazi scientistBrain Drain, who compelled them to assassinate their respective country's leaders. In his diminished stature, Micromax infiltrated thePrime Ministers’s residence but was intercepted byAuroraofAlpha Flight, who swiftly rendered him unconscious. Aurora's teammates intervened to neutralize the other heroes under Brain Drain's control.[9]\nOn the civilian front, Scott capitalized on his popularity from Britain’s leading radio station to secure an opportunity in television. On the day of his interview, a striking woman arrived at Radio One under the guise of a chauffeur sent by TV executives. However, as Micromax ventured into the dimly lit parking garage, he fell into an ambush orchestrated by theCherubimdue to his refusal to align with R.C.X., the British intelligence faction that had absorbed F.I.6's remaining assets. Subdued swiftly byAC-DC, Micromax lay incapacitated on the pavement, reverting to his true form: slightly paunchy and balding. This revelation demonstrated Micromax's ability not only to alter his size but also to change his appearance.[2]Micromax was transported toCloud Nine, an R.C.X. facility, where he endured agonizing tests to gauge the extent of his mutant abilities. Between examinations, he languished in a stasis tube alongside captured members of Excalibur and former R.C.X. operatives. However, Nightcrawler andCeris, closely monitored guests at Cloud Nine, eventually uncovered and liberated their imprisoned comrades. Their escape sparked a fierce confrontation with the combined forces of Cloud Nine's elite units: the Cherubim,Seraphim,Sky Pilots, andAdvocates. Initially hampered by power inhibitors, Excalibur and Micromax managed to overcome the obstacles. Ultimately, the leader of R.C.X.,Nigel Orpington-Smythe, capitulated after suffering injury at the hands ofCaptain Britain.[10]\nFollowing Excalibur’s return from their latest mission, Micromax was welcomed into their ranks as their newest member. His initiation into the Excalibur lifestyle commenced with a morning training session, which took an unexpected turn when theStarjammersmade an unannounced appearance. They explained their mission to retrieve a fugitive from theShi'ar Empire, prompting Micromax to impulsively engage them, much to Nightcrawler’s dismay. Though he held his ground againstRazaandCh'od, the skirmish was swiftly halted whenCerise, the accused fugitive, surrendered willingly. Despite Nightcrawler's objections, Cerise departed withCorsair, but Rachel intervened, using telekinesis to keep the Stargate open, allowing Nightcrawler, Phoenix, Micromax, andKylunto pursue. Upon arriving on the prison planet, Nightcrawler transported himself to the Starjammer with a miniaturized Micromax in tow. There, they discovered that the Starjammers harbored doubts about Cerise’s guilt. Reuniting with Rachel and Kylun on the planet's surface, they descended into the harsh terrain ofKrag, the prison colony. After locating Cerise, they uncovered the grim truth behind her alleged crimes and witnessed her sentencing to serveLilandra Neramaniand remain within the empire.[11]\nAfter returning to Earth, Scott resigned from Excalibur and headed to the United States to take on the role of head of security at theBrand CorporationinNew Jersey. Perhaps the cosmic setting didn't suit him, or maybe he felt constrained by Nightcrawler's leadership.[12]However, his next encounter with his former Excalibur comrades occurred at Captain Britain andMeggan's wedding. There, he caught up with Kylun, confiding in his old friend that he had been laid off from Brand a month earlier and had been passing the time watching soap operas.[13]\nMicromax's boredom was short-lived as he was once again enlisted by the British government. WhenKangdecided to conquer the 21th century, he started his war inFrance. Micromax, along withLe Peregrine, theAvengersHercules,She-Hulk,Firebird, andThor, and the armies ofFrance, Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, and others, stood against his armies.[14]\nDuring the catastrophic event ofM-Day, Scott was among the fortunate few who retained their abilities. Shortly thereafter, as part ofMI13, Micromax was loaned out once again by the British government, this time to the United States. Tasked byTony Starkwith apprehending several mutants of the198who had escaped from the estate of theXavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, Micromax joined forces withBishop,Sabra, and theO*N*Eprogram.[15]Micromax personally disagreed with theSuperhuman Registration Actbut agreed to follow on with the mission. The runaway mutants were located hiding in the Nevada desert, but before Micromax and his team could intervene, a retrieval squad led byCyclopsintercepted them. The situation escalated when Johnny Dee took control of Cyclops, prompting him to attack Bishop and sparking a fierce conflict between theX-Menand ONE operatives.[16]\nAmidst the chaos, Micromax demonstrated his worth by securing Bishop's safety and incapacitating Cyclops. He swiftly engagedArchangel, seizing him from the skies and delivering punishing blows. However, Micromax's triumph was short-lived whenShatterstar, armed with swords, fatally wounded him while he was in his enlarged state.[17]As a ceasefire was declared underVal Cooper's command, Micromax received urgent medical attention, including a transfusion of Archangel’s healing blood. He was evacuated by helicopter to a hospital for further treatment.[18]\nScott managed to survive and subsequently along with Excalibur was sent out the country byPhilip Gavin, an ambitiousMI5assistant director, withheld information about a terrorist attack to manipulate his way into the directorship. When the threat was revealed, he formed a team destined to fail but was ultimately thwarted byUnion Jackand others, saving lives. When Micromax returned he revealed he was sent on a \"wild goose chase\", Gavin's scheme crumbled as Union Jack forced him to confess his crimes to the press.[19]\nU.S. sponsored black-ops unitVanguard\nHe joined a U.S. sponsored black-ops unit known asVanguard. During a mission where his miniature form infiltrated and incapacitated anAl-Qaedaoperative, he was captured and subjected to torture by the terrorist group in retaliation. Threatened with the safety of his niece, Micromax reluctantly divulged classified information about Vanguard to his captors. His betrayal remained concealed from his comrades until the death ofColonel America, a powerful telekinetic operative within the team. A diligent detective namedStacy Dolanunraveled the truth behind the breach of intelligence. However, before Micromax could face repercussions from his clandestine colleagues, Craft reappeared, revealing himself to be alive. With Vanguard's security compromised, Craft was ordered to eliminate all remaining members. Anticipating Craft's intentions, the team's telepath,Retcon, manipulated Craft into believing his mission was successful, allowing everyone to escape. In the aftermath, Micromax and the surviving operatives decided their only chance of survival was to go underground and fake their deaths, evading further pursuit.[20]\nHe later moved to the mutant-only nation ofKrakoa, where he was candidate to become an X-Man. Micromax tries to engageGentlein small talk but is left intimidated after learning the Gentle has already been an X-Man. After losing the vote, Micromax pitches starting their own team \"The Giant-Size X-Men\" with Tower.[21][22]\nDuring the second Hellfire Gala, he unsuccessfully tried to flirt withSiryn. He was also poisoned by theTyphon Groupand briefly lost control of his powers.[23]\nSize Alteration:Able to grow and shrink in size and mass. Strength proportionate to size. He can grow as small as one inch and as tall as 50 feet.[3]"

When the Millers died in a tragic automobile accident, Layla was placed in theSaint Joan's Orphanageinthe BoweryofNew York City. Soon after relocating to the orphanage, Layla'smutantpowermanifested and she grew horns and discovered she could breathe fire, frightening the human orphans and causing them to reject her.[3]\nWhen theScarlet Witchused her powers to remake reality into a world in which mutants were the dominant species, everything changed for Layla. Her parents were alive and in health, and she lived with them and attendedBrooklyn's PS 45. Additionally, a new set of mutant powers manifested and enabled her to perceive divergent realities, allowing her to remember theworldas it had been before the Scarlet Witch warped reality. Seeking the help ofDaredevil, Layla instead foundLuke Cage,Hell's Kitchen's most powerful crime lord and leader of a human resistance movement. Layla was able to restore Luke's true memories, and after rescuingWolverine, Cage's group set out to use Layla's powers to unlock the unconscious memories of other heroes. Under the guidance ofEmma Frost, Layla restored the memories of many of Earth's heroes, who then led an assault on the Scarlet Witch inGenosha. The attack on Genosha prompted the Scarlet Witch to restore reality, only with a significantly reduced mutant population, an event later calledM-Day.[17]\nWith reality restored, Layla woke up and found herself back in the orphanage she hated - only without her former mutant powers.[1][18]Instead, Layla would find that she possessed a new power; the ability to resurrect the dead, though without their souls.[19]Shortly thereafter, an adult Layla returned fromthe futureand came to the orphanage to speak with her younger self and upload all the knowledge about her lifetime and information on the next 80 years into the mind of her younger self.[4]Armed with this pseudo-precognitive knowledge, Layla ran away from the orphanage and showed up atthe officeofX-Factor InvestigationsinMutant Townoffering help and claiming she \"knows stuff\".[16]Without an invitation or permission, Layla began working as a file clerk and using her knack for predicting the future to give X-Factor advice and steer them in certain directions.[20]\nLayla working as a file clerk for X-Factor Investigations\nLayla directedSirynonto theSantiago case, saving her life,[20]and later savedRictorfrom aSingularity Investigationsassassin.[21]But when Theresa was severely beaten byTryp Junior, Layla was blamed for not warning X-Factor and voluntarily returned to theorphanage. Layla was beaten and ridiculed at the orphanage, andMadroxandWolfsbanebrought her back to X-Factor.[3]\nWhenQuicksilverarrived at X-Factor's office with information about the true cause of M-Day, Layla declared herself Quicksilver's nemesis.[22]Later, with theInhumanslooking for Quicksilver, Layla advised him thatBlack Boltwasn't going to kill him during the confrontation and that he should take a small trip to the future to see the outcome of what happened to them. She and Jamie went to the meeting where she revealed to Jamie that she tried to kill Pietro but couldn't because he escaped and that his actions were meant to happen.[23]\nNot long after, a group made up of ex-mutants, calling themselvesX-Cell, who believed thegovernmenthad depowered mutants, began operating inMutant Town. Around this same time, Theresa andMonetreturned from their brief trip toFrance, with an ex-mutant namedNicole, which shocked Layla because she had no knowledge of her arrival. After Quicksilver had restored most of X-Cell's mutant powers using hisTerrigen Crystals, Layla paid him a visit. She revealed toCallistoandMarrowthat it was he and Wanda Maximoff who caused M-Day, and that Pietro had lied. She helped them and X-Factor foil Pietro's schemes.[24]\nNicole attacks Layla in Central Park\nInCentral Park, Layla was ambushed by Nicole only to be saved by a crazed Quicksilver, who believed that he needed to kill her. After escaping Quicksilver, and having him arrested, Layla was tracked down again by Nicole. Layla tricked Nicole into falling in front of a train, which destroyed her, revealing she was actually an android.[25][26]\nAround this time she was also offered a place amongNick Fury'sSecret WarriorsbyDaisy Johnsonbut declined, claiming that with her they would fail, and that the mutants would need her more.[27]\nAfterthe birth ofthe first mutantsince M-Day,Cyclopscontacted X-Factor to request some favors.[28]Though uninvited, Layla accompanied Madrox, who was sent toEagle PlazainDallasto meet withForgeto investigate new mutant populatedpossible futures. Afterthe first dupewas sent into the time stream to one of these futures, the second dupe prepared to leave only for Layla to jump in with him as the pair were sent 80 years intothe future.[29]\nLayla and a Madrox dupe jump into the timestream\nWhile there, they discovered that mutants had been confined to internment camps.[30]Captured and interred, both Madrox and Layla were branded as mutants.[31]They learned from ayoung Bishopthat the \"mutant messiah\" had caused this by killing a million humans, prompting humanity to intern and restrict mutants. Layla then proceeded to kill the dupe to send the information back to the original Jamie, leaving her alone and stranded in the future.[8]\nDespite being trapped in the future, Layla still interacted with Jamie as a figment of his imagination. This figment served as \"stuff Jamie knew deep down\", appearing in moments of self-realization, such as when Jamie admitted to himself that he knew about Theresa'spregnancy.[32]\nLayla eventually escaped the camp and helped a new mutant calledLinqon. Layla informed some bystanders about a secret government program calledOperation Purity, which involved every citizen being tested formutant genes. Though this was untrue at the time Layla knew it would happen eventually and that by spreading this misinformation people would believe it was coming and she could make it happen quicker. Layla got a young man namedDwayneto drive her toAtlantic Cityand met up withCyclopsand his daughterRuby. Together with Ruby, Dwayne, and Linqon she helped initiate theSummers Rebellionwhich she had spread fear to help incite and that she knew had to happen.[5]\nAdult Layla Miller kissing Jamie Madrox\nAfter years of trying, Layla found a way to project a solid hologram toher present.[33]Pretending to be a nun, she made an arrangement to meet withPastor John Maddox. When she arrived at John's church, she found Jamie about to kill himself. She stopped him and revealed who she really was, much to his shock.[34]After convincing Jamie to travel to the future with her, they were attacked bySentinels, but together with the Summers Rebellion they managed to escape.[35]Once they were safely back in Atlantic City, Layla and Jamie argued about how they never came for one another, the two finally gave into their emotions and shared a kiss. Jamie wasn't very comfortable about starting a relationship with Layla, feeling she was still a child, though Layla told him even when they met, she hadn't truly been a child.[36]\nThe next morning, Cyclops tasked them to find out why some of the rebellion's mutants were winking out of existence.[37]To find out more about time travel, Madrox, Layla and Ruby went to enlist the help ofDoctor Doom, now old, destitute and living in a hotel, barely able to discern reality from his remembered glory days.[37]Doom revealed he had previously met Layla, and explained the concept of aDoomlock, a device that allowed a cybernetic organism to change its personal timeline. They brought Doom back to Atlantic City to aid in solving the mystery, but Doom betrayed them by enslaving Cyclops and summoningCortexto kill them all. Cortex quickly killedTrevor Fitzroy, and Layla was forced to reveal her true powers, reviving Fitzroy at Ruby's request, inevitably turning him into the villain he was destined to be, since Layla could bring people back, but without their souls.[19]The initial mystery was also revealed to have been Cortex's attempts to kill the rebellious mutants' ancestors to prevent their births.[4]\nAfter defeating Cortex,Anthony Falcone, and his Sentinels, both Layla and Madrox were sent back in time via aTime Platform. Jamie arrived atXF Investigations Headquartersjust a few days after he left, but Layla went even further back to arrive atSaint Joan's Orphanagejust before she joined X-Factor to give her younger self information about the future.[19]\nAfter the meeting with her younger self, Layla traveled toLatveriato speak withDoctor Doom. After revealing her knowledge ofthe future, Doom agreed to share some of his knowledge of science andmagicin exchange for Layla's advice about the future. Layla stayed with Doom as an advisor and apprentice for a year until the disappearance of theInvisible Womanbrought X-Factor into direct confrontation with Doom.[38]\nAfter they learned this Doom wasn't to blame and an alternate version of him was in New York about to killFranklinandValeria Richards, X-Factor used one ofShatterstar's portals to teleport back. While they were making the jump, Layla intentionally distracted Shatterstar in the exact moment thatStrong Guywas punching the evil Doom, causing Shatterstar to abruptly close the portal and behead him, leaving himself and Layla behind.[38]\nLayla with Doctor Doom\nLayla next appeared at theDublinAirport with Shatterstar to save Theresa (now going by Banshee) fromTrask'sM.R.D.[39]After they escaped, the trio joined the rest of X-Factor back inNew York City.[14]Once back with the team, Layla returned to her old tricks of giving advice and steering others in certain directions. Layla still maintained a somewhat romantic relationship with Madrox, including joking about marriage[40]and acting playfully jealous.[41]\nWhen her teammate, Strong Guy, was fatally wounded in an attack byBallistique, Layla used her reanimation powers to secretly bring him back to life, much to the astonishment of X-Factor andDoctor Castillo.[42]By resurrecting Strong Guy, Layla Miller veered off the timeline she had known and created new possibilities and new unknowns.[43]She chose to resurrect Strong Guy in part to spare Monet from the guilt about his death and also because she wanted to take fate into her own hands, tired of merely following a laid out path.[44][45]\nWith the birth ofWolfsbane'schildapproaching, Layla began to prepare to defend theX-Factor Investigations Headquartersfrom being besieged by mystical forces by adding warding symbols and laying salt at the doors and windows.[46]\nAlong with Madrox and the rest of the X-Factor Investigations crew, Layla traveled toLawrenceville,Kansaswhere she metSally Rolandand her sonTerryliving on Jamie's oldfamily farm.[47]When Sally was found dead with an X-Factor Investigations card, they were called back out to Lawrenceville. While inspecting the body, the corpse was reanimated to deliver a threat fromB.B.[48]After facing Sally's ex-husband, theHangman, the team traveled toLos Angeles, where they were attacked by Bloodbath, who killed Madrox.[49]With Jamie dead, Bloodbath revealed Layla's true powers of resurrection to the entire team. As Layla contemplated resurrecting Madrox without a soul, Bloodbath attacked again. With help from Hangman,Shatterstardecapitated Bloodbath who promptly possessed Madrox's corpse leading to Layla performing an exorcism to banish him back toHell.[6]\nJamie had in fact survived, with his soul being set bouncing throughout theMultiverse. Layla brought his body back to New York, had a third-year medical student repair the physical damage, and stored it with dry ice. After that, she sat and waited. When Madrox was eventually returned to his body, Layla was there to greet him and the pair had sex for the first time.[50]\nWhen Madrox was found alive by the rest of the team, Monet (believing Layla had resurrected him) was furious with Layla and flew off with her to theEmpire State Building. After scaring some tourists, Monet demanded answers from Layla and she revealed the reasons she chose to resurrect Strong Guy.[51]\nSince resurrecting Strong Guy and altering the timeline, Layla continued to try to play her part in the timeline like telling Madrox aboutFar Sight's illiteracy[52]and rescuingAngelique Sassonfrom committing suicide. However, her actions seemed to continue to alter and splinter the timeline further.[45]\nLayla Miller andJamie Madrox's wedding photo\nAs the X-Factor team began to splitter, Jamie spontaneously asked Layla to marry him and the couple ran off toLas Vegasto be married as soon as possible.[53]During the honeymoon, the couple were pulled into an investigation of the murder of anAbraham Lincolnimpersonator at the hands of a zombieRobert E. Lee.[54]\nFollowing their honeymoon, the couple flew back to New York and were immediately pulled into theHell on Earth War.[55]As X-Factor battled theLords of Hell, Jamie was taken byMephistoand changed into ademon.[56]\nFollowing theHell on Earth War, Layla found the demonic Jaime inMarrakesh,Moroccowhere he was being held by a family that believed he was adjinn. After freeing him, Layla brought Madrox tohis old family farm. When Layla told him that she was pregnant, the demon Madrox prayed toMorriganto change him back to his original form. Once Jamie was back to normal, he and Layla retired from X-Factor Investigations.[13]Sometime after retiring, Jamie sold the rights to the \"X-Factor\" name toHarrison SnowandServal Industries.[57]On the farm, Layla and Jamie lived off of half of the earnings fromMatt Rocks, Esq.[58]\nLayla eventually gave birth to her sonDavey.[13][59][60]\nAfter receiving an ominous warning fromKid Cable,Wolverinesought out Layla Miller for advice on protectingCyclops. Layla turned down Wolverine's invitation to join him, but encouragedJamieto \"go be a hero for a while\".[60]Layla was one of the many attendees ofWolfsbane's funeral.[61]\nWhen the mutant nation ofKrakoawas formed, theFiveseemingly resurrected Jamie Madrox and recruited him to research and development,[62]leading Madrox to split his time between his family and his work.[11]\nDuring the launch of theIonospheric Bandwidth Generator, Layla asked Jamie to come home to witness Davey's first steps. Madrox sent a dupe, planning to reabsorb him and gain his memories, but the dupe died and the memories of Davey's first steps were lost.[11]\nShe was seen on Krakoa with her son, Davey, greeting a newly resurrected Madrox atArbor Magna.[12]\nLayla reanimating a dead butterfly\nLayla Miller is amutantwith powers including:\nIn addition to her mutant powers, Layla has acquired:\nLayla's mysterious device"

Its most famous landmark is  theWundagore Mountain. Its capital isEast Transia.\nIn theDarque Hold, a chamber among the caverns inside the mountain that would later be known asMount Wundagore,Chthonwrote theDarkhold, his book of black magic.[2]\nIn ancient times, the land that would became known as Transia was a grim and mountainous realm set south of theBorderlands(themselves south from thecold norththat had been home of the immortal warriorBloodstone). Within that realm lied the mountainVanda-Gor, where aSkrulltrapped on Earth lived and set up an altar toSl'gur't. He terrorized the people living around the mountain and was known to be a \"sorcerer-god from beyond the stars\".\nTaking the form of a merchant, he lured Bloodstone in his lair, intending to slay him, and take theBloodgemfor his own, in order to return to his world. And after the brutal destruction of the sorcerer's animated corpses, the Skrull revealed his plot, only to be beheaded moments later by Bloodstone.That tale was recounted in \"The Star-Spawned Sorcerer\", 1928.[3]\nIn the 6th Century CE, the sorceressMorgan Le Fayand her cult ofDarkholders, unable to controlChthon, whom they had summoned, imprisoned him withinWundagore Mountain, inTransia.[4][5][verification needed]Chthon's evil entered into the clay and wood of Wundagore, and could be used as a sort of sympathetic magic by forming images of people used to manipulate said people from a distance. Later, those clay and wood would be respectively used by thePuppet Masterand byDjango Maximoff.[1]\nTransia was once part ofWallachia. However, when when that country merged withMoldaviaandRomaniain 1857, Transia broke off on its own,[6][1]establishing itself as an independent state under theTreaty of Transia.[6]\nThe country was recognized 20 years later, in theTreaty of Berlin, as an autonomous and neutral country.[6]\nTransia remained neutral during theBalkans Warsduring the early 20th century, and duringWorld War I.[6]\nWundagore Mountain became part of the estate owned byGregor Russoff, the father ofJack Russell, who sold part of his estate, including Wundagore Mountain, to the High Evolutionary and his partnerJonathan Drew, the father ofJessica Drew. On the mountain Jonathan Drew and Wyndham discovered a rich deposit of uranium.[citation needed]In 1928, they used the wealth they obtained from it, as well as the slave labor of a population ofMoloids, to build theCitadel of Science.\nSince the 1930s,[1]Wyndham began to procure both domestic and wild animals and genetically accelerated them into \"New Men,\" animals with humanoid posture and intelligence. Among the first of his New Men were Bova, a cow-woman; Porga, a pig-man; and Tagar, a tiger-man.[7][8]\nTransia remained neutral once more duringWorld War II, without being affected by theNaziblitzkrieg, and without its territory being ever crossed by any hostile army. Though the locals can't explain why, it was explained by their isolated position and reduced population, but also by one other inexplicable factor. All theories tie into the excessive mystical energies detected throughout Transia.[6]\nThe spirit of the sixth century sorcererMagnus, a disciple of Morgan le Fay and among those who had imprisoned Chthon within Wundagore Mountain, took possession of the body of Jonathan Drew in order to warn the High Evolutionary of the demonic threat beneath his feet. Magnus and the High Evolutionary decided that the New Men should be trained to combat Chthon's impending attack, and Magnus suggested they be organized and trained along the lines of the highly disciplined soldiers of his day, the Arthurian Knights of the Round Table. Magnus supervised the training of the New Men who became the Knights of Wundagore and instilled in them a sense of chivalry. When Chthon finally attacked through his host, the Other, he was defeated by the combination of the High Evolutionary's advanced science, Magnus's sorcery, and the battle prowess of the Knight of Wundagore.[9]On the very night of this battle, a woman namedMagda, who had sought refuge at the High Evolutionary's citadel, reportedly gave birth there to twins, who later became known asQuicksilverand theScarlet Witch. Chthon imbued the newborn infant who would become the Scarlet Witch with latent potential for using magic.[10]\nAfter their victory over Chthon, the Knights of Wundagore undertook the full-time task of patrolling and protecting Wundagore. The High Evolutionary had equipped the Knights before their battle with Chthon with suits of armor that are extraordinarily resistant to damage, advanced weaponry, and nuclear-powered one-man flying craft known as the \"atomic steeds.\" (One of these \"atomic steeds\" is today utilized by theBlack Knight.) The Knights of Wundagore have used such armor, weaponry, and means of transportation ever since.[11]\n\"Mount Wundagore\"\nEventually, the High Evolutionary created a New Man who proved to be a menace, theMan-Beast, whom he had evolved from a wolf. After theAsgardianthunder god,Thor, aided in defeating the Man-Beast, the High Evolutionary decided that Earth was too confining an environment for his New Men. Having converted his Citadel into a starship, the High Evolutionary set forth within it, along with his New Men, for the stars to seek a planet for them to settle. The only New Men to remain behind on Earth were Bova and Tabur.[12]\nAlerted by theScarlet Witch, theAvengersand theBlack Widowcame here to look forPietro Maximoff. There they discovered a huge U.F.O. holding inside a computer namedIxar, draining information from the village's burgomeister. Ixar's plan was to extract the powers from the Avengers and use it to make specialUltroids. They also discovered Scarlet Witch to be a fake Ultroid called Ultrana. Ultrana and the Ultroids attacked the Avengers, capturing them.[13]\nOnce they were released and the spacecraft took off, the Avengers returned to the village, without telling anyone that their burgomeister was actually Ixar himself.[14]\nAfter theI.D.I.C.severed its ties toA.I.Mand became a splinter faction, theChapel of the Single Shadowcame to be the headquarters of the group's delving into cultist fanaticism.[15]After the religious movement had acquired theirNuhumanmessiah,Adam Roderick, they immediately set out to bring their own plans into fruition using the boys talents to augment many of their followers though belief. WhenS.H.I.E.L.D.caught wind of their darknet site, bothField Director CoulsonandMagister Karnakset out to their headquarters in Transia. When theS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrierentered the rural monastery's airspace, it was immediately beset by super-powered religious agents with sonokinetic abilities, but the Magister easily, and rather bloodily, dispatched their offensive capabilities by singing an opposing hypersonic tune at them through a speaker system onboard the vessel he was in, greatly thinning their ranks in the process.[16]\nTheTransia Conflictwere tensions on the high between Transian rebels (using alien weapons supplied by theZoo Family) and communist neighbors, with analysts' expectations of war imminent.[17]\nTransia's geographic local seems to have retconned over the years: One official map depicts the country landlocked in the southern Balkans and borderingSerbia/Montenegro,Macedonia,Greece,BelgriunandTransylvania.[1]A later map depicts the country as located betweenBulgaria,Romania,Transylvania,Symkaria, andSerbia. The two maps also offer up conflicting locations for other countries, such asLatveria.[18]\nThe predominant language in Transia is Romanian.[19]However,German,HungarianandSymkarianare also commonly spoken.[1]\nThe seat of government is located in the capital city. Transia is actively involved in global stage and is a member of theEuropean Union, as well as theUnited NationsandWorld Trade Organization.[1]\nTransia's monetary unit was theTrans.\nThe country possessed a number of natural resources including coal, iron ore, uranium, timber, petroleum, salt, and natural gas. It is also produced toys.[1]\nTransia has no formal military. The High Evolutionary'sKnight of WundagoredefendedMount Wundgore.[1]\nThe country populace largely consists of humans of European descent, including a sizable Romani population. Since the early twentieth century, Mount Wundagore serves as the home of New Men as well as a population ofMoloidswhich the High Evolutionary uses for slave labor.[1]"

The MRD gets a positive ID from a waterfront warehouse and moves out. The sergeant, however, is run over by the Dread-X battle tank as it rolls through the street.\nIn South America,Baron Mordo,Guido,Monetand her dad are holed up in Mordo's base after the MRD's attack. The MRD are ordered to evacuate in preparation for an air strike. Guido predicts the strike and asks Mordo to teleport them out, but Mordo says that it would use up the last of the energy he stole from Monet. Monet herself wakes up and makes a deal with Mordo, that if he teleports them out, he can drain all the energy needs afterward.

Monet initiates a psychic assault on Trask, which temporarily frees him from Bastion's control. Using the moment of clarity, Trask orders all the MRD forces to stand down and abort the mission, then uses a pistol to commit suicide before Bastion can reclaim his mind.

Nearly 90% of the world's mutants lost their powers overnight.\nWith few mutants left after M-Day,Cyclopsopened the Xavier Institute to any mutant who needed refuge in that most difficult time.Sentinel Squad O*N*Ewas formally activated by thePresidentand dispatched to the Xavier Institute to monitor the remaining mutants. They got into a brief quarrel with the X-Men but stopped afterEmma Frostrevealed the Sentinel units were piloted. The two groups then joined forces when the mutant-hating fanatical group known as theSapien Leagueattacked the Mansion. The Squad remained stationed outside of the Xavier Institute to monitor the status of the mutants living there.\nThe first few mutants to arrive wereMammomax,Erg,Peepers, andOutlaw. Shortly, the group grew to includeToad,Lorelei Travis,Johnny Dee,Sack,Fever Pitch,Jazz,Karma,Skids,Arclight,CalibanandLeech,Collective Man,Diamond Lil,Beautiful Dreamer, andEmpath, among many others.\nThey were forced to live in tents as most of the mansion had been destroyed in the battles between the Sentinels and the Sapien League. Many, if not all residents, did not like the Sentinels guarding over them and the lack of direction. They soon named themselves the '198', in reference to the supposed total amount of remaining mutants on the planet according toCerebra, and raised a flag with that number on it.\nWhen the powerful mutantMr. Marrived to the Institute, he took out a Sentinel because it had come close to stepping on a rare caterpillar. Later, Mr. M displayed his amazing powers by regrowing out Lorelei's hair. The X-Men and the O*N*E* Squad were both uncomfortable with him and were unsure how to approach the matter. When Erg attempted to leave the grounds, a battle ensued, only to be ended by Mr. M.\nSome feared that they would have to stay there a long time whenValerie Cooperrevealed plans to build more permanent facilities. When some demanded to leave, Cooper wouldn't allow it, but instead allowed them to go around a nearby town on the condition that they would wear electronic tags for tracking purposes. When Mammomax was ridiculed by a human he tried to attack, but his tag shocked him. The 198 were upset that the tags were capable of harming them.\nMeanwhile, Jazz was trying to buy some drugs when Johnny Dee used his mutant power to strangled his small Jazz doll, choking the real Jazz to death. When the 198 learned of Jazz's death, they blamed the tags and started a riot. The situation quickly grew out of control and Mr. M and Lorelei decided to leave and invited all 198 members to join them. The Sentinels could only watch as they left.\nWhen the Sentinels and the X-Men followed them to a nearby island, Mr. M proved himself more than a threat to both of them. WhenScalphunterthreatenedBeast, Lorelei tried to stop him, only for him to hit her. That was when Mr. M lost it. Meanwhile,General Lazeragreed to allow Johnny Dee to deal with the threat. Johnny Dee used his Leech doll to cancel Mr. M's power. When Mr. M was down, Dee used his Magma doll to incinerate Mr. M. Later, when Lorelei and Leech watched over Mr. M's coffin, he seemed to evolve, giving the 198 hope.\nApocalypsesoon came and offered the 198 salvation, to their curiosity. WhenFamineattacked, making all of the hungry, Apocalypse claimed his elixir could heal them. Apocalypse took down the Sentinels as they drank his elixir. But when the elixir was destroyed during the battle, Apocalypse left. The 198 continued to live at the institute for a while longer witnessing the attacks ofWilliam Strykerand theChildren of the Vault.\nSoon another riot broke out, this time led by Caliban and Erg. It was discovered to be distraction forDominoandShatterstarto free the 198. Roughly half escaped with Domino on an aircraft and went to an abandoned SHIELD base. Iron Man placedBishopin charge of finding the 198.\nThe X-Men concluded that if the 198 were found, there would be fatalities. The X-Men discovered where the base was, but Domino wouldn't let them in. Meanwhile, General Lazer gave Johnny Dee a sample of Cyclops' DNA, and with it they discovered where the X-Men and the 198 were located. General Lazer forced Johnny Dee to make Cyclops attack Bishop to prove that mutants were dangerous. When the 198 tried to help, he forced some 198 members to attack. Johnny Dee reached his limit, however, as he could only control one doll at a time.\nWhen Val Cooper learned of Lazer's plan, she arrested him. However, she was too late, and he set off some weapons that would go off soon in the SHIELD base. When she interrogated him, he realized too late that Johnny had made a doll of him, and Johnny killed him. With the help ofIron ManandMs. Marvel, the X-Men managed to get in and rescue the 198 and the weapons exploded. Leech stopped Cyclops' power from going ballistic, Johnny Dee was arrested, and the 198 were given total amnesty, to come and go wherever they choose."

They find Doom aged and infirm, being attended by a busted, old robot servant, however he still believes himself to be at the height of his glory and wealth. Despite his senility, he quickly surmises that the group is there to learn about the manipulation of time due to a previous communication with Layla Miller, with whom Doom is rather taken. Unbeknownst to Madrox and Doom, they are being secretly observed byDr. Falcone, science adviser to the President, and a man named \"Shaw,\" presumably a descendant ofSebastian Shawof theHellfire Club. Falcone is puzzled that Madrox is alive and in Doom's apartment. Madrox originally died in the mutant concentration camps and they sent Cortex back to kill him again to make sure no weird time-travel thing happens to change the present. Falcone sends a squad of Sentinels to Detroit, and asks for a real-time link to Cortex.\nIn the present,Rictor (Julio Richter)andStrong Guyare fightingShatterstar, who is being controlled byCortex. Cortex himself is sitting on a park bench while he controls Shatterstar in the fight. He observes thatMaddoxdid not replicate when struck, and hypothesizes that Madrox's dupes lose the ability to replicate if they are separated from him for too long. A cop comes by to usher him along, citing vagrancy laws, but Cortex grabs the cop's nightstick and shoves it through his stomach, killing him.\nJohn Maddox brandishes his gun, but Shatterstar throws a chair at him and disarms him. Rictor grabs the gun and fires it, but Shatterstar is able to deflect the bullet with his sword. Rictor is impressed and complements the move. Shatterstar says thanks and prepares to finish Rictor off. However, Strong Guy grabs Shatterstar's sword and hold him back. Shatterstar releases his second sword and prepares to stab Strong Guy, but Strong Guy throws him up through the roof and into the sky.\nGuido comments on how light Shatterstar was, and Rictor explains that Shatterstar's bones are hollow and that he comes from  the same dimension asLongshot. Rictor guesses that something is wrong with Shatterstar and that he's not acting like himself. He says they should help Shatterstar, not fight him. Shatterstar lands and runs to attack Strong Guy. At that moment, the real-time link from Falcone comes through and interrupts Cortex, who is belligerent and rude with Falcone, telling Falcone that he's too busy to talk so Falcone should go away. Falcone sends a pulse through the link as punishment. The pulse hits just as Shatterstar is getting ready to stab Strong Guy in the brain, and Cortex's mind control link is severed. Shatterstar falls to the ground, disoriented. Rictor rushes to reassure him that everything's alright. Shatterstar kisses Rictor.\n\"DIRTY SEXY MONET\" AND \"CORTEX\"\nhttp://marvel.com/catalog/X-FACTOR.2005.45"

Arize explained that the man Rictor called Longshot is a recently-hatched clone of Shatterstar. Noting his peculiar appearance and unique physiology, Arize created a slightly modified copy of Shatterstar as an experiment. As he explained, Arize used his machinery to restore Shatterstar's memory.\nMojo's forces arrived and overwhelm the rebels, forcing Shatterstar to create a portal for his and Rictor's escape.

It's assumed it was here he developed his strong sense of honor and pride as a warrior, to combat the constant violence and death in his life.\nDuring his time in the arenas, Shatterstar formed a relationship withGringrave, a popular female gladiator commonly known as the Smiling Executioner. Gringrave manipulated Shatterstar for her own ends, teaching him not to love or get attached to others, and live only for the thrill of the kill.[14][15]\nEventually, Shatterstar grew disillusioned with the idea of killing for sport. He escaped and joined the Blood Cadre Alliance, the rebel group that sought to overthrowMojo V's dictatorship. From there, he learned the Cadre's language and began taking part in missions, one of which sent him back in time to find the X-Men and get their assistance in defeating Mojo.[16]\nWith X-Force\nInstead of finding the X-Men, Shatterstar was transported back in time to Earth at the point just before Cable reorganized theNew MutantsintoX-Force. WithCable's assurance that they would help him defeat Mojo, Shatterstar became a founding member of the new team.[17]X-Force was also where he first metRictor. Shatterstar and Rictor formed a close friendship. Shatterstar learned Spanish specifically to communicate privately with Rictor.[18]After an awkward trip to a nightclub, Shatterstar also confessed to Ric that he wasn't emotionally prepared for physical interaction, due to his upbringing on Mojoworld. Rictor vowed to help Star with his development.[19]\nLater Shatterstar discovered, to his bewilderment, that he also had the memories of an Earthling namedBenjamin Russell.[8]Soon afterwards, Mojo made Cable and Shatterstar his prisoners and transformed them into digital images for one of his television programs. In the course of the show, Shatterstar was mortally wounded in combat. Mojo's sometime allySpiralteleported Cable and Shatterstar back into reality, where they regained their true forms. Spiral brought Cable, Shatterstar, Longshot, and the X-Force memberSirynto theWeisman Institute for the Criminally InsaneinRutland,Vermont.[citation needed]\nThere Spiral directed them to the bedside of one of its patients, a mutant named Benjamin Russell who had no living relatives, had been in a coma since his powers had emerged, and, curiously, looked identical to Shatterstar. Longshot transferred Shatterstar's \"uemeur,\" or soul, into Benjamin Russell's body, and the two became one. Apparently Shatterstar's body merged with Russell's as well, for the resulting body bore the starburst pattern that Shatterstar had around his left eye and his hair lengthened greatly. Restored to full health and consciousness, and feeling \"whole\" for the first time in his life, Shatterstar resumed his work as a member of X-Force.[20]\nShatterstar accompanied Rictor to the Richter home inMexicoto try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business.[21][22]Presumably they succeeded, though it's not known why they later parted.\nShatterstar was later inMadripoor, earning his money by fighting in arenas. He was sought out by Spiral, who had one of her agents make Shatterstar believe she wanted to kill him. With a fake quest, Spiral lured Shatterstar to an alternate universe she had conquered and ruled. On that Earth, Spiral had also killed most of that worlds heroes and mutants. That Earth's Shatterstar had been killed as well. He was found by that Earth's rebel forces, including Cable and some others he knew from X-Force. Together, they eventually defeated Spiral.[23]Upon returning to the mainstream Earth, Shatterstar was contacted by Cable, who requested that Shatterstar temporarily join him on a mission to defeat theSkornn. Shatterstar agreed, but first Cable wanted him to train with monks on Mount Xixabangma. After those monks were killed by Skornn's worshipers, Shatterstar was reunited with his old team and they eventually killed the Skornn.[24]\nFollowingM-Dayand the passing of theSuperhuman Registration Act, Shatterstar teamed up with former X-Force alliesDominoandCalibanto breakThe 198out of the encampment set up for mutants on the grounds of theXavier Institute. They took the escapees to a secret base provided to them byCaptain AmericaviaNick Fury. While fightingO*N*Ehe nearly killedMicromax, claiming that while there is no such thing as murder during war, he had only meant to disable him.[25]\nAt some unknown point,Cortexgained control over Shatterstar and sent him to attack his friends. While searching for Madrox, Rictor andStrong GuydiscoveredFather Maddox, a dupe of Madrox's, that had been living in New England as a priest. They decided to investigate further, hoping to find the whereabouts of Madrox Prime. Upon meeting Father Maddox, a masked man crashed through the window with swords ablaze. After a brief battle, the attacker was revealed to be Shatterstar, possessed by Cortex.[26]\nRictor and Shatterstar kissing\nOnce Shatterstar was broken out of his trance-like state, and recognized Rictor, the two embraced one another and finally shared a kiss.[27]\nShortly afterwards Shatterstar transported X-Factor toLatveria, where he remained withLayla MillerandDoctor Doomfor a while.[28]Layla and Shatterstar next appeared atDublin Airportto saveTerry CassidyfromTrask'sMutant Response Division.[29]After they escaped, the trio rejoined the rest of X-Factor back in New York City.[30]\nRictor and Shatterstar began a steady romantic relationship after Shatterstar's return though not without its difficulties. Rictor, having finally come to terms with his sexual identity, wanted a stable monogamous relationship with Shatterstar. Shatterstar, on the other hand, found himself interested in a more open relationship that would allow him to explore other sexual possibilities. The two resolved that they would work things out, and proceeded to make up both emotionally and physically. However, before they could get very far, the two were interrupted when a pregnantWolfsbanebarged in.[5]\nWolfsbane was pregnant withHrimhari's child, although she led Rictor and the others to believe he was the father.[31]This lie did not last long as a brief encounter between Hrimhari and Shatterstar inNiffleheimcleared up the question of paternity.[32]\nAfter the birth and abandonment ofWolfsbane's son, Shatterstar and Rictor volunteered (unsolicited) to accompany Wolfsbane in searching for her child.[33]The trio first traveled toHeland receive a mystic amulet to locate the child, and finally found him inSproul State ForestinPennsylvania. Wolfsbane's son,Tier, was being tracked independently by bothDarwinandVanorabut Shatterstar and Rictor were able to fight off attacks from both, and Tier escaped unharmed with his mother. Wolfsbane then chose to leave X-Factor and raise Tier with the aid and protection ofJack Russell, the Werewolf By Night.[34]Shatterstar and Rictor, however, returned to X-Factor Investigations in New York City.[35]\nAfter Rahne and her son, Tier, returned to X-Factor to seek sanctuary from Darwin and other would-be assassins, all of X-Factor were transported toHell. TheHell Lordsvied to gain overall control by killing Tier, and X-Factor fought their demon armies to protect him. When Shatterstar attackedMephistoto free Tier from a magical prison, Mephisto seemingly vaporised him, before doing the same to Rictor.[36]\nIn fact, Rictor and Shatterstar both ended up going back in time and being transported to theMojoverse. Shatterstar was again brainwashed into attacking Rictor - this time in a televised gladiatorial battle. Rictor managed to incapacitate Shatterstar, before escaping the arena with help from Mojoverse rebels, including the Longshot of this era. Whilst he was unconscious, Shatterstar was brought toArize, who cloned him (and used some of his DNA to create Longshot). Shatterstar awoke in time to use his powers to escape an attack byMojoandSpiral, and Shatterstar transported them forward in time. In this new time period, Rictor came acrossDazzlergiving birth to Shatterstar as a baby. Rictor and Shatterstar helped to deliver the baby, before Shatterstar erased Dazzler's memory. To maintain the timeline as it was meant to take place, Shatterstar then transported himself, Rictor, and his infant self forward in time again - by 100 years - to the period he grew up in.[13]\nShatterstar and Rictor somehow made it back to Earth and their own time, and joined their fellow mutants - including former teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane - inNew Tian.[37]After New Tian was dismantled, Rictor told Iceman that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.[38]\nShatterstar rejoined the X-Men in New York to investigate signs that thePhoenix Forcemight have returned to Earth, checking the Manhattan sewers in a team with Dazzler and Strong Guy.[39]\nRictor and Shatterstar try to navigate their newly separated status\nFeeling unsure about himself and his relationship with Rictor, Shatterstar ended things between them.[40]Newly single, Shatterstar bought a property using the earnings he'd made and named it Manor Crossing. He offered the rooms to multi-dimensional refugees like himself and served as both landlord and protector to his tenants. When Shatterstar's tenants were kidnapped by the Mojoworld mercenary group theDeath Sponsorsand their leader, former allyGringrave, Shatterstar vowed to bring them home.[7]\nWith help from Rictor, Shatterstar followed the group to the world of Horus IV, which was ruled by theGrandmaster. Grandmaster tasked Gringrave with the kidnapping, hoping to use a gladiatorial battle between the enemies to satisfy the Horuvians lust for bloody conflict.[40]\nAfter Shatterstar killed Gringrave in revenge for her actions,[15]Grandmaster himself entered the arena, seeking to gain control of Shatterstar for all eternity. But Shatterstar refused to concede and defeated Grandmaster by teleporting them toEarth-1218, a world where super-powered beings do not exist and Grandmaster's god powers could not work. Shatterstar was then rescued by Rictor, who reached out across the universe to find him and bring him home.[41]\nShatterstar was shocked when his former mentor Cable was slain while attempting to protect the time-displaced Iceman.[42]When it was revealed that a younger version of Cable was responsible, Shatterstar partnered with his former X-Force teammates to hunt downKid Cableand have him answer for his crime. During the search, Shatterstar was turned into one ofAhab's mutant-hunting hounds and attempted to kill the time-displaced Jean Grey.[43]Shatterstar was subdued by Cannonball and freed of Ahab's influence.[44]\nAfter Kid Cable returned the time-displaced X-Men to their timeline and disappeared, Shatterstar joined a newly reformed X-Force to resume their search for him. They found Kid Cable in the small nation ofTransia, working withDeathlokto uncover how the country's military had gotten ahold of weapons from Kid Cable's future. Shatterstar and his team were forced to team up with Kid Cable when they were framed for the murder of the Transian president.[45]\nShatterstar struggled to trust Kid Cable and accept him as the real Nathan Summers,[46]but the pair worked together with the rest of X-Force to defeat the Transian military. They learned the military's futuristic weapons were being supplied byStryfethrough a time portal.[47]Strye took Kid Cable into the future through the portal and X-Force resolved to rescue both him and the kidnappedRachel Summers. Shatterstar was prepared to give his life for the potentially one-way mission, feeling like there was little left for him since Rictor's presumed death.[48]\nX-Force defeated Stryfe, rescued both Kid Cable and Rachel Summers, and found a way to return to their timeline. Shatterstar finally declared his trust in Kid Cable and forgave him for murdering the older Cable. Shatterstar also resolved to return to the present, stop seeking distractions, and instead focus on grieving Rictor properly.[49]\nShatterstar was of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation ofKrakoaupon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.[50]\nAt some point, Shatterstar returned to Mojoworld, becoming the dimension's most subscribed and top-ranked live-streamer. However, Shatterstar began to feel trapped by the celebrity status he had created for himself. When fellow live-streamerWind Dancerarranged for her own death to satisfy her fans, Shatterstar secretly informed the KrakoanX-Factorteam so they could claim her body beforeArizecould produce a clone and force Wind Dancer to resume her stream. X-Factor were successful in their mission, but had to leave Shatterstar behind in Mojoworld. They promised to one day return and rescue him.[51]The team eventually made good on this promise coming back alongside the New Mutants and arranging the freedom of all mutants there. After this they recruited Shatterstar to defeatThe Morrigan, freeingSirynfrom her control.[52]He was then rewarded with memories of his past, which lead to him seeking Rictor out during the Hellfire Gala,[53]after which they sat on the coastline of the newly created Braddock Isle and caught up with one another.[54]\nReunited with Rictor, Shatterstar joinedExcaliburin their battle againstKing ArthurinOtherworld.[55]He became one ofCaptain Britain'sKnights of Xand helped her to liberate Otherworld.[56]\nShatterstar is a mutant,[58]the naturally born son of the mutant Dazzler and the artificially-engineered Biped Longshot.[13]As a result, he was born with many of the superhuman traits Longshot was engineered to possess, in addition to his own unique mutant abilities. Shatterstar also merged withBenjamin Russell, with whom he shares an unexplained connection. Russell was also reportedly a mutant.[59]Russell's mutant powers are unknown, but Shatterstar did not appear to gain or lose any abilities when the two merged. Although his teleporting ability surfaced after he bonded with Russell, the two events happened 13 years apart and were not noticeably connected.[60]"

However, some members of the race refused to use them and called themselves the Spineless Ones. Instead, they used motorized platforms to transport their bodies. They also became the rulers and demanded a race of slaves to do all the tasks they could not or would not do. Arize created theslaves, humanoid beings, using genetic engineering and basing their appearance on the \"demons\" of the Spineless Ones' nightmares - which were actually the characters of TV broadcasts of Earth-616, somehow scattered throughout their timeline and perceived by the Spineless Ones.[2]Unknown to the Spineless Ones, Arize secretly planted the seeds in their genetic make-up to eventually turn on their masters and rule Mojo-world justly. Arize was banished by the Spineless Ones when he refused to build weapons for them.[3]\nIt was revealed that because ofMephisto's manipulation ofShatterstarby sending him back in time to theMojoverse(along withRictor), he was discovered and experimented on by Arize who created Longshot from his DNA, essentially becoming his father. This created a paradox when Longshot impregnatedDazzlerwho then gave birth to Shatterstar. Longshot and Dazzler were mindwiped to forget the pregnancy and the Shatterstar infant was sent 100 years to the future in order to maintain the consistency of the time line.[4]\nEventually, Longshot returned to free the slaves and deposed Mojo, with the help of Mojo's upright, more human looking (although yellow) cloneMojo II. However, Mojo II turned out to be just as bad as his predecessor and Longshot had to defeat him as well. After Mojo II was ousted Mojo reclaimed his position and became the leader of Mojo World once more.[5]\nMojo learned of the rival network overtaking his ratings and decides to air a special in which Spiral hunts down and kills Arize.X-Factorinvestigate the attack and converge at Arize's cabin. X-Factor managed to stop Spiral before she can kill Arize. He apologized for he future actions Arize and Spiral, decided to join forces to break Mojo’s endless cycle of oppression.[6]\nMojo tried to hunt down Arize but he escaped to Earth. He arrived inAfghanistanand the X-Men found him their thanks toCerebro. But Mojo and his retrieval team arrived to find the fugitive, but they were no match to the X-Men. They retreated back to the Mojoverse. Mojo was humiliated by his team’s embarrassing defeat on live television that he declares he can create his own race of slaves instead of retrieving Arize.[7]\nComplete wavelength signal absorption immunity:Contrary to the otherSpineless Ones, Arize was somehow immune to the absorption of signals fromEarth, and consequently wasn't driven insane by them.[1]"

His murder grantedStrong Guythe title ofKing of Hell.\nAfterWolfsbanejoined theX-Forceshe was captured and brainwashed by thePurifiers. X-Force rescued her and Rahne was resting inAngel's Aeriewhere she was found by the Asgardian Wolf PrinceHrimhari.[3]Former lovers, they rebuilt their relationship and slept together.[4]They soon were attacked by theFrost Giantsand, after the battle, Wolfsbane lost consciousness. Faintly she called out forElixir.[5]\nHrimhari rushed her back to Angel's Aerie, where he was met byArchangelandWarpathwho accompanied him to theX-Menbase onUtopia[6]. Unfortunately, Utopia was under attack bySelene's undeadmutants[7][8]and Elixir was in a comatose state due to the strain exerted by time traveling[9]and in healingSurge.[4]\nWolfsbane's condition continued to worsen, and in desperation Hrimhari called upon the death goddessHela.[10]Hela offered Hrimhari an even trade: a life for a life. She asked him to choose between his true love, Rahne, or their unborn child (which was the reason Rahne was dying). In the end, Hrimhari chose to exchange his life for Elixir's, knowing the Elixir could save both Rahne and his unborn cub. As Hrimhari and Hela disappeared he told a recovered Elixir to save Rahne and told her \"I love her...and...I will find a way back to her.\"[11]To save Wolfsbane's life, Elixir had to strengthen her body (to undefined limits) to endure theAsgardianembryo growing inside her.[12]\nRictorand pregnantRahne\nAfter the battle onGenoshawith Selene and herInner Circle, Rahne was removed from active duty on X-Force by Wolverine.[13]Wolfsbane fled Utopia.[14]and returned toNew York Cityto rejoinX-Factor Investigations. There she ledRictorto believe the child was his.[15]Soon they met withDr. Castillo, who tried to examine the fetus by ultrasound, but discovered that sound couldn't penetrate Wolfsbane's body. Dr. Castillo decided that it was a mystical, rather than biological, protective function. After this, Rictor realized that the baby was not his.[16]At the same time X-Factor had invadedNiffleheim, whereShatterstarfought with Hrimhari and learned the truth, that Hrimhari was the father of Wolfsbane's child.[17]When the team returned to their headquarters, Shatterstar andLayla Millerconvinced Rictor to still support Rahne, because despite her lying she still came to him for help, and he eventually forgave her.[18]\nA few days later, Rahne and Shatterstar went for a walk, to talk about Rictor, but their conversation was interrupted when Rahne smelled blood in the church. They broke into a church and clashed with a demon, theSin-Eater, who claimed that due to the fact that Rahne's child would be born soon, the walls between dimensions weakened, and the demon was able to visit Earth.[19]Being the first child born of mutant and god, the child was allegedly destined to be a major player in an upcoming war, prompting various parties to try to acquire him in order to control and raise him in their own image, for the final goal of winning said-war.[20]\nOutside the church they met the ghost ofFeral, having been returned to the world to serve as an anchor for the demons and gods hunting for Rahne's child.Cu Sith,Kasha,Okami, andBastetall appeared immediately after that. Rahne and Shatterstar fought them off while Layla prepared the headquarters for mystic assault.[21]With gods, demons, and monsters bearing down, Rahne was narrowly escaped withJack Russell, the Werewolf by Night.[22]\nTier's unconventional birth\nRussell and Rahne fled in his '57 Chevy Timber Wolf, and were attacked byCerberus. While Russell fought off Cerberus, Rahne was able to flee. Shortly afterward X-Factor andFenrisarrived and joined the fight. Meanwhile, Wolfsbane was met byAgamemnonin the woods, who offered to help and shelter her in his home.[23]Once inside, he bound Rahne in enchanted chains and locked her in a protective circle. Wanting the child, Agamemnon administered drugs to relieve Rahne's pain, and prepared a knife for a Caesarean-section. However, the birthing process was too far along, and the child was delivered through Rahne's mouth.[20]\nTier with theWerewolf by Night\nImmediately after birth, the child attacked Agamemnon, causing Rahne to recoil in fear and revulsion. Her reaction frightened the child and he fled. Upstairs,MadroxandBansheeentered the house looking for Rahne. The child attacked them, and Banshee used her sonic scream on him, blasting him out of the house. In the woods where he landed, Hela found him, but the other gods and monsters met her shortly afterward, and a battled ensued. While they battled, the child hid. Later he was found by Russell, who intended to raise him as his own.[20]\nTogether Tier and Russell evaded several attacks fromDarwin, who followed them across the country. Thanks to a magical amulet obtained from Hrimhari inNiffleheim, Wolfsbane, Shatterstar, and Rictor were able to find Tier and Russell and save them from Darwin andVanorain theSproul State ForestinPennsylvania. After the reunion and rescue, everyone was teleported to one ofWolverine's safe-houses inNova Scotiawhere Rahne opted to leave X-Factor and remain with her son and Russell.[24]\nWith Darwin still hunting him, Rahne sent Tier toNew York Citywhile she and Russell tried to hold off their attacker. Rahne and Tier finally arrived atX-Factor Investigations Headquarters, but were quickly followed by Darwin, and later byJezebelandStrong Guy. Without much explanation the entire party was transported to a mesa in the wilderness with theHell Lordswaiting to kill Tier and begin their war.[1]Tier battled and killed every Hell Lord who attacked him directly includingSatana,Pluto,Hela, andSatannish(although some credit can be attributed to them being weakened by their infighting and fighting with the X-Men), with Mephisto being the only one left. Before he could finish off Mephisto, he was stabbed in the back with a magical trident byStrong Guy. Tier vanished in a flash of light, dying.[25]\nDuring theDark Council's invasion ofEarth, Hrimhari made a deal with theEnchantresswhere he and Tier could be allowed to come to Earth and reunite with Rahne but on the condition that all three not interfere with the Dark Council's war. Hrimhari and Tier reunited with Rahne as she was being held prisoner bySabretooth. When Rahne and Sabretooth got into a fight overMagik, Hrimhari was forced to step in and take out Sabretooth.[26]\nHrimhari and Tier accompanied Rahne and Magik as they reunited with the X-Men but were unable to aid the X-Men fight off the Dark Council's armies with Hrimhari trying to prevent Rahne from fighting as well as it would violate the deal he made with the Enchantress. The deal was ultimately broken when Rahne attacked Sabretooth to stop from killing Magik and taking control of his pack of Wolf Gods. Hrimhari and Tier were forced to return to Hel, with Hrimhari telling Rahne that he hoped to reunite with her in the next life.[27]\nMutant/Asgardian Hybrid Physiology:Tier was the son of a lupine-mutantand anAsgardianwolf god. He resembled ahumanoid-wolfwith razor sharp claws and fangs. He has demonstrated the following abilities:"

He was born able to shapeshift into either a full wolf or wolfman.[3]\nLittle of his past was known, though he was known as a being of unquestionable honor and a friend to theWarriors Three.[8]\nHrimhari encountered theNew MutantRahne Sinclairwhen she and her teammates were stranded in Asgard due to the machinations of the Trickster GodLoki. He instantly became enamored with her, and Rahne was likewise responsive to his feelings, though her stern upbringing byReverend Craiginitially prevented her from fully reciprocating.[3]They were then captured by Loki and forced to wear a pair ofCollars of Obedience. The collars turned them into monstrous wolves,GrimfangandBleakheart, who were forced to track down theX-Menand New Mutants. Hrimhari and Rahne were eventually freed from Loki's control byCannonball, who destroyed the collars with an enchanted sword.[9]\nHrimhari met Rahne again shortly after when the New Mutants return to Asgard to stopHela's plan to reconquer Asgard with Valkyries. Hrimhari would help Rahne and the New Mutants stop Hela, although they would be separated yet again when Rahne returned to Earth.[10]\nDuring the fall of Asgard,Frost Giantsfought and killed Hrimhari's entire pack. Hrimhari tracked the Frost Giants quickly and while locked in battle with them, Hrimhari foundRagnarok. Hrimhari was reborn along with Asgard onMidgard(inOklahoma). Hrimhari claims he was reborn for the purpose of finding his true love, Rahne Sinclair.[11]\nHrimhari & Wolfsbane in the semi-human/semi-wolf forms\nWhile Rahne was recoveringX-Force's second mission and her brainwashing inAngel's Aeriein theColoradoRocky Mountains, Hrimhari found her, much to her surprise.[12]Now reunited with his former lover, Hrimhari explained to Rahne the fall of Asgard, the murder of his pack, and his own rebirth on Midgard.[11]Hrimhari then revealed to Rahne that he can now shapeshift into a fully human form,[13]and they consummated their newly rekindled romance.[14]\nBut in the throes of afterglow, next to a roaring fire on the floor of Angel's Aerie, Hrimhari and Wolfsbane were attacked by three of the Frost Giants who slaughtered Hrimhari's pack. At first they fled, but then Hrimhari and Wolfsbane decided they could no longer run and turn to face their attackers. After narrowly defeating the Frost Giants, the seemingly uninjured Rahne fainted due to unknown causes,[15]faintly called out forElixir.\nHrimhari rushed her back to Angel's Aerie, where he was met byArchangelandWarpath, who accompany him to theX-Menbase onUtopia.[16]Unfortunately, Utopia was under attack bySelene's undeadmutants[17][18]and Elixir was still in a comatose state due to the strain exerted by time traveling[19]and in healingSurgefrom the modifiedLegacy Virus.[14]\nWolfsbane's condition continued to worsen, and in desperation Hrimhari called upon the death goddessHela.[20]Hela offered Hrimhari an even trade; a life for a life.

Hrimhari was able to smell Rahne's scent onShatterstarand immediately attacked him.[4]Shatterstar was able to hold his own against Hrimhari and learned that Hrimhari was actually the father of Rahne's unborn child,[24]notRictoras Rahne had led the team to believe.[25]\nDuring theDark Council's invasion ofEarth, Hrimhari made a deal with theEnchantresswhere he and Tier could be allowed to come to Earth and reunite with Rahne but on the condition that all three not interfere with in the Dark Council's war.

However, Magik proved difficult to control. So, Sabretooth kidnapped Rahne so he could use her to force Magik to cooperate, but Hrimhari forced Sabretooth to back down. When Rahne demanded Sabretooth release Magik, Hrimhari asked Sabretooth to obey Rahne's request. Rahne and Sabretooth then got into a fight, forcing Hrimhari to step in and take out Sabretooth.[26]"

Latent antagonism between the group stemming from a variety of factors -the recently-ended conflict between the X-Men and New Attilan, the X-Men'scurrent precarious relationship with Hydra- lead to needling language from both sides, but Quake eventually gets to the point, explaining that she has come here for an Inhuman named Leer, who she wants to recruit.

The first contact she made, who claimed to be Tony Stark, told her to forgo heroism as it would only get her killed if she tried it now. When she insisted she needed help, as Hydra soldiers were swarming Jersey City, Stark said they are probably looking for her, and to help the locals by getting out of town.\nIn New Tian, the punch escalates into a brawl between the three heroines, which ends when a fissure opens in the earth. Ms Marvel blames Quake, but it turns out this is the work of Rictor, who opines that Quake should\"get some original powers\". Beast and Karnak agree that tempers are too high for discourse to continue, and that the Inhumans should leave.

Due to a mix of frustration, envy, and Karnak's plan, Quake incapacitates the jet, and they go off the road.\nIn Jersey City, on a night after the takeover, Ms Marvel was working a late patrol, when she ran across two young men in balaclavas, with a plan to blow up some Hydra trucks. Ms Marvel argued for them not to, citing the locals who use the street, and urged them to be better than their opponents. However, this appeal to liberal sensibilities had been spoiled by the arrival of actual fascists with guns, and the three youths had ran.\nIn New Tian, Karnak has led the group to an isolated shack, which he reveals to be the surface of a secret laboratory. Moon Girl is enraptured, but the others, who are tall enough to see the modified corpses on the gurneys, are wary. When the lab's owner, Dark Beast, arrives, he claims to have idea who Leer is, so Quake leads the group to catch him, and then locks herself, Dark Beast, and Karnak, into a back room. Ms Marvel refuses, afraid that Quake is about to do something unethical, but Quake uses her powers to induce nausea, and pushed everyone out of the room.\nIn Jersey City, on a night after the takeover, Hydra soldiers had arrived on the doorstep of the Khan family, looking for a specific young man. Yusuf Khan, the father, was politely but deliberately unhelpful, and after they left, ordered that no-one was to go outside, as innocent people would only come to harm among such men. His daughter Kamala, in her costumed identity as Ms Marvel, snuck out an upstairs window and shadowed the soldiers, and watched as they and a battalion of similar men assembled outside a specific house, taking an Inhuman into custody. As they led him to a prison wagon, one of the soldiers bragged that they had found him by using\"a little pressure\"on a young man who tried to put a bomb in a truck, and that individuals are powerless against organized evil like Hydra. In the shadows, Ms Marvel wants to act, but can think of nothing.\nIn the lab, Ms Marvel, Inferno and Moon Girl wait with dread in the silence after Dark Beast's screams have stopped. When the door opens, all of Ms Marvel's anxieties at this situation come pouring out, and she insists that torture is wrong. Quake meets this with her own anxieties, admitting that she has done terrible things in the name of her crusade, and will do more. And that while she respects that Ms Marvel's power comes from her moral strength, that if the mission requires her to do terrible things to terrible people to save lives, then Quake will not hesitate.\nAt this point the argument is interrupted by the X-Men, revealing that they survived the jet crash, and Beast admits that while he is angry, the fact that Quake's team has uncovered a torture lab run by a mad scientist will be his priority for the rest of the night, and that they should leave, now, and never come back. Quake's team does as their told, while the X-Men take Dark Beast into custody.\nIn the car, the sullen silence between Quake and Ms. Marvel is broken only by Inferno opining on the complicated lives and personal attractiveness of the X-Men. Quake admits that Dark Beast could only tell them that Leer had been taken by Hydra, and so the mission is at a dead end. Ms Marvel asks to be taken back to Jersey City, but before the group can plan their next move, they are ambushed - by a battalion of Hydra soldiers, backed up by four Avengers, and led by Mister Hyde - Quake's absentee father!\nSECRET EMPIRE TIE-IN!\n• The team’s quest to unite the Inhumans will bring them into the land of the only people who truly understand the dangers they face: The X-Men!\n• But, uh, it does NOT go well...\n• Quake’s leadership forces Ms. Marvel to make some tough choices about what she is willing to do to win this war."

Trailed by a swarm of cam drones, Shatterstar leads X-Factor out of the arena and toArize’s streaming studio, where Wind Dancer’s body is being kept.

Prosh even joins in and plays for the skins team. Meanwhile, Cable hides in a cave trying to determine what is causing his T-O mesh to go crazy the past 24 hours. He is worried that it is also somehow connected to the arrival of Prosh.\nOver the next couple days, Prosh changes the X-Force IPAC unit into a more efficient, yet odd-looking vehicle. Shatterstar is still worried that they are running out of resources due to the power constraints caused on the base by Prosh. He tries to voice this concern to Rictor.\nCable then decides that he is being affected by Prosh and that the only logical way to deal with it is for Prosh to leave. He tells him that he will miss him, but that he can keep the body but he must go. Prosh is upset but is happy to know that he will be able to have his own body and be back in space. The team says their goodbyes and he thanks them. Then he attaches himself to the X-Force IPAC and blasts the ship into space. X-Force then leave Camp Verde and looks for their new base."

It's assumed it was here he developed his strong sense of honor and pride as a warrior, to combat the constant violence and death in his life.\nDuring his time in the arenas, Shatterstar formed a relationship withGringrave, a popular female gladiator commonly known as the Smiling Executioner. Gringrave manipulated Shatterstar for her own ends, teaching him not to love or get attached to others, and live only for the thrill of the kill.[14][15]\nEventually, Shatterstar grew disillusioned with the idea of killing for sport. He escaped and joined the Blood Cadre Alliance, the rebel group that sought to overthrowMojo V's dictatorship. From there, he learned the Cadre's language and began taking part in missions, one of which sent him back in time to find the X-Men and get their assistance in defeating Mojo.[16]\nWith X-Force\nInstead of finding the X-Men, Shatterstar was transported back in time to Earth at the point just before Cable reorganized theNew MutantsintoX-Force. WithCable's assurance that they would help him defeat Mojo, Shatterstar became a founding member of the new team.[17]X-Force was also where he first metRictor. Shatterstar and Rictor formed a close friendship. Shatterstar learned Spanish specifically to communicate privately with Rictor.[18]After an awkward trip to a nightclub, Shatterstar also confessed to Ric that he wasn't emotionally prepared for physical interaction, due to his upbringing on Mojoworld. Rictor vowed to help Star with his development.[19]\nLater Shatterstar discovered, to his bewilderment, that he also had the memories of an Earthling namedBenjamin Russell.[8]Soon afterwards, Mojo made Cable and Shatterstar his prisoners and transformed them into digital images for one of his television programs. In the course of the show, Shatterstar was mortally wounded in combat. Mojo's sometime allySpiralteleported Cable and Shatterstar back into reality, where they regained their true forms. Spiral brought Cable, Shatterstar, Longshot, and the X-Force memberSirynto theWeisman Institute for the Criminally InsaneinRutland,Vermont.[citation needed]\nThere Spiral directed them to the bedside of one of its patients, a mutant named Benjamin Russell who had no living relatives, had been in a coma since his powers had emerged, and, curiously, looked identical to Shatterstar. Longshot transferred Shatterstar's \"uemeur,\" or soul, into Benjamin Russell's body, and the two became one. Apparently Shatterstar's body merged with Russell's as well, for the resulting body bore the starburst pattern that Shatterstar had around his left eye and his hair lengthened greatly. Restored to full health and consciousness, and feeling \"whole\" for the first time in his life, Shatterstar resumed his work as a member of X-Force.[20]\nShatterstar accompanied Rictor to the Richter home inMexicoto try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business.[21][22]Presumably they succeeded, though it's not known why they later parted.\nShatterstar was later inMadripoor, earning his money by fighting in arenas. He was sought out by Spiral, who had one of her agents make Shatterstar believe she wanted to kill him. With a fake quest, Spiral lured Shatterstar to an alternate universe she had conquered and ruled. On that Earth, Spiral had also killed most of that worlds heroes and mutants. That Earth's Shatterstar had been killed as well. He was found by that Earth's rebel forces, including Cable and some others he knew from X-Force. Together, they eventually defeated Spiral.[23]Upon returning to the mainstream Earth, Shatterstar was contacted by Cable, who requested that Shatterstar temporarily join him on a mission to defeat theSkornn. Shatterstar agreed, but first Cable wanted him to train with monks on Mount Xixabangma. After those monks were killed by Skornn's worshipers, Shatterstar was reunited with his old team and they eventually killed the Skornn.[24]\nFollowingM-Dayand the passing of theSuperhuman Registration Act, Shatterstar teamed up with former X-Force alliesDominoandCalibanto breakThe 198out of the encampment set up for mutants on the grounds of theXavier Institute. They took the escapees to a secret base provided to them byCaptain AmericaviaNick Fury. While fightingO*N*Ehe nearly killedMicromax, claiming that while there is no such thing as murder during war, he had only meant to disable him.[25]\nAt some unknown point,Cortexgained control over Shatterstar and sent him to attack his friends. While searching for Madrox, Rictor andStrong GuydiscoveredFather Maddox, a dupe of Madrox's, that had been living in New England as a priest. They decided to investigate further, hoping to find the whereabouts of Madrox Prime. Upon meeting Father Maddox, a masked man crashed through the window with swords ablaze. After a brief battle, the attacker was revealed to be Shatterstar, possessed by Cortex.[26]\nRictor and Shatterstar kissing\nOnce Shatterstar was broken out of his trance-like state, and recognized Rictor, the two embraced one another and finally shared a kiss.[27]\nShortly afterwards Shatterstar transported X-Factor toLatveria, where he remained withLayla MillerandDoctor Doomfor a while.[28]Layla and Shatterstar next appeared atDublin Airportto saveTerry CassidyfromTrask'sMutant Response Division.[29]After they escaped, the trio rejoined the rest of X-Factor back in New York City.[30]\nRictor and Shatterstar began a steady romantic relationship after Shatterstar's return though not without its difficulties. Rictor, having finally come to terms with his sexual identity, wanted a stable monogamous relationship with Shatterstar. Shatterstar, on the other hand, found himself interested in a more open relationship that would allow him to explore other sexual possibilities. The two resolved that they would work things out, and proceeded to make up both emotionally and physically. However, before they could get very far, the two were interrupted when a pregnantWolfsbanebarged in.[5]\nWolfsbane was pregnant withHrimhari's child, although she led Rictor and the others to believe he was the father.[31]This lie did not last long as a brief encounter between Hrimhari and Shatterstar inNiffleheimcleared up the question of paternity.[32]\nAfter the birth and abandonment ofWolfsbane's son, Shatterstar and Rictor volunteered (unsolicited) to accompany Wolfsbane in searching for her child.[33]The trio first traveled toHeland receive a mystic amulet to locate the child, and finally found him inSproul State ForestinPennsylvania. Wolfsbane's son,Tier, was being tracked independently by bothDarwinandVanorabut Shatterstar and Rictor were able to fight off attacks from both, and Tier escaped unharmed with his mother. Wolfsbane then chose to leave X-Factor and raise Tier with the aid and protection ofJack Russell, the Werewolf By Night.[34]Shatterstar and Rictor, however, returned to X-Factor Investigations in New York City.[35]\nAfter Rahne and her son, Tier, returned to X-Factor to seek sanctuary from Darwin and other would-be assassins, all of X-Factor were transported toHell. TheHell Lordsvied to gain overall control by killing Tier, and X-Factor fought their demon armies to protect him. When Shatterstar attackedMephistoto free Tier from a magical prison, Mephisto seemingly vaporised him, before doing the same to Rictor.[36]\nIn fact, Rictor and Shatterstar both ended up going back in time and being transported to theMojoverse. Shatterstar was again brainwashed into attacking Rictor - this time in a televised gladiatorial battle. Rictor managed to incapacitate Shatterstar, before escaping the arena with help from Mojoverse rebels, including the Longshot of this era. Whilst he was unconscious, Shatterstar was brought toArize, who cloned him (and used some of his DNA to create Longshot). Shatterstar awoke in time to use his powers to escape an attack byMojoandSpiral, and Shatterstar transported them forward in time. In this new time period, Rictor came acrossDazzlergiving birth to Shatterstar as a baby. Rictor and Shatterstar helped to deliver the baby, before Shatterstar erased Dazzler's memory. To maintain the timeline as it was meant to take place, Shatterstar then transported himself, Rictor, and his infant self forward in time again - by 100 years - to the period he grew up in.[13]\nShatterstar and Rictor somehow made it back to Earth and their own time, and joined their fellow mutants - including former teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane - inNew Tian.[37]After New Tian was dismantled, Rictor told Iceman that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.[38]\nShatterstar rejoined the X-Men in New York to investigate signs that thePhoenix Forcemight have returned to Earth, checking the Manhattan sewers in a team with Dazzler and Strong Guy.[39]\nRictor and Shatterstar try to navigate their newly separated status\nFeeling unsure about himself and his relationship with Rictor, Shatterstar ended things between them.[40]Newly single, Shatterstar bought a property using the earnings he'd made and named it Manor Crossing. He offered the rooms to multi-dimensional refugees like himself and served as both landlord and protector to his tenants. When Shatterstar's tenants were kidnapped by the Mojoworld mercenary group theDeath Sponsorsand their leader, former allyGringrave, Shatterstar vowed to bring them home.[7]\nWith help from Rictor, Shatterstar followed the group to the world of Horus IV, which was ruled by theGrandmaster. Grandmaster tasked Gringrave with the kidnapping, hoping to use a gladiatorial battle between the enemies to satisfy the Horuvians lust for bloody conflict.[40]\nAfter Shatterstar killed Gringrave in revenge for her actions,[15]Grandmaster himself entered the arena, seeking to gain control of Shatterstar for all eternity. But Shatterstar refused to concede and defeated Grandmaster by teleporting them toEarth-1218, a world where super-powered beings do not exist and Grandmaster's god powers could not work. Shatterstar was then rescued by Rictor, who reached out across the universe to find him and bring him home.[41]\nShatterstar was shocked when his former mentor Cable was slain while attempting to protect the time-displaced Iceman.[42]When it was revealed that a younger version of Cable was responsible, Shatterstar partnered with his former X-Force teammates to hunt downKid Cableand have him answer for his crime. During the search, Shatterstar was turned into one ofAhab's mutant-hunting hounds and attempted to kill the time-displaced Jean Grey.[43]Shatterstar was subdued by Cannonball and freed of Ahab's influence.[44]\nAfter Kid Cable returned the time-displaced X-Men to their timeline and disappeared, Shatterstar joined a newly reformed X-Force to resume their search for him. They found Kid Cable in the small nation ofTransia, working withDeathlokto uncover how the country's military had gotten ahold of weapons from Kid Cable's future. Shatterstar and his team were forced to team up with Kid Cable when they were framed for the murder of the Transian president.[45]\nShatterstar struggled to trust Kid Cable and accept him as the real Nathan Summers,[46]but the pair worked together with the rest of X-Force to defeat the Transian military. They learned the military's futuristic weapons were being supplied byStryfethrough a time portal.[47]Strye took Kid Cable into the future through the portal and X-Force resolved to rescue both him and the kidnappedRachel Summers. Shatterstar was prepared to give his life for the potentially one-way mission, feeling like there was little left for him since Rictor's presumed death.[48]\nX-Force defeated Stryfe, rescued both Kid Cable and Rachel Summers, and found a way to return to their timeline. Shatterstar finally declared his trust in Kid Cable and forgave him for murdering the older Cable. Shatterstar also resolved to return to the present, stop seeking distractions, and instead focus on grieving Rictor properly.[49]\nShatterstar was of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation ofKrakoaupon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.[50]\nAt some point, Shatterstar returned to Mojoworld, becoming the dimension's most subscribed and top-ranked live-streamer. However, Shatterstar began to feel trapped by the celebrity status he had created for himself. When fellow live-streamerWind Dancerarranged for her own death to satisfy her fans, Shatterstar secretly informed the KrakoanX-Factorteam so they could claim her body beforeArizecould produce a clone and force Wind Dancer to resume her stream. X-Factor were successful in their mission, but had to leave Shatterstar behind in Mojoworld. They promised to one day return and rescue him.[51]The team eventually made good on this promise coming back alongside the New Mutants and arranging the freedom of all mutants there. After this they recruited Shatterstar to defeatThe Morrigan, freeingSirynfrom her control.[52]He was then rewarded with memories of his past, which lead to him seeking Rictor out during the Hellfire Gala,[53]after which they sat on the coastline of the newly created Braddock Isle and caught up with one another.[54]\nReunited with Rictor, Shatterstar joinedExcaliburin their battle againstKing ArthurinOtherworld.[55]He became one ofCaptain Britain'sKnights of Xand helped her to liberate Otherworld.[56]\nShatterstar is a mutant,[58]the naturally born son of the mutant Dazzler and the artificially-engineered Biped Longshot.[13]As a result, he was born with many of the superhuman traits Longshot was engineered to possess, in addition to his own unique mutant abilities. Shatterstar also merged withBenjamin Russell, with whom he shares an unexplained connection. Russell was also reportedly a mutant.[59]Russell's mutant powers are unknown, but Shatterstar did not appear to gain or lose any abilities when the two merged. Although his teleporting ability surfaced after he bonded with Russell, the two events happened 13 years apart and were not noticeably connected.[60]"

Madrox answered him that he'll deal if and when it came to it, but felt confident that he and the others dupes would do the best they could.[1]\nHe went out to study religion and eventually became an episcopal priest. He also met and marriedSusan.[2]Susan once had an affair that resulted in the birth of her son,Daniel. However, John and Susan completely reconciled and John has raised Daniel as his own son without ever disclosing the true paternity.[3]\nWhen Madrox sought him out to reabsorb his all of his wayward dupes, he found John preaching at St. Paul's Episcopal Church inVermont. Upon recognizing Madrox Prime, John fled and later threatened to shoot Jamie. Jamie won the resulting contest of wills, and John finally submitted to absorption. However, Jamie decided to let the dupe remain free and live with his family because it was the life Jamie felt he could never have.[2]\nAfter accidentally absorbingSean Madrox[4], Jamie leftXF InvestigationinDetroitand began to walk to Vermont while contemplating suicide. Madrox came back to the reverend to explain that his son, Daniel, could not be his biological son because Madrox did not absorb him when they touch. John already knew about Susan's affair. After giving this news to John, Jamie planned on shooting himself. John tried to wrestle the gun from him, but was knocked unconscious during the struggle. However, before Jamie could kill himself he was caught off guard by an adultLayla Miller.[3]\nJohn regained consciousness in time to see Madrox and Layla vanished. In their wake, an assassin possessed byCortexentered the church. After another brief struggle, the assassin shot himself simply saying \"Cortex\".[5]\nStrong GuyandRictorsaw the news about the assassin attacks in Vermont and decide to investigate this dupe to find out if he knew anything about Madrox's whereabouts.[6]During their visit,Shatterstarpossessed by Cortex busted through the window and tried to stab Rictor.[7]A fight ensued, and Shatterstar was narrowly freed from Cortex's control.[8]After the dust settled, Maddox demanded that no more X-Factor Investigation staff visit him.[9]\nWhile attending a conference inIreland, Rev. Maddox decided to visit some older churches in the area and ran intoTerry Cassidy. Terry was visiting herfather's grave in the family church yard nearCassidy Keep. After some initial confusion about Maddox's identity, Terry and Maddox had a long discussion about God's plan. Maddox helped Terry in dealing with the death of her father and in the loss of her son.[10]\nAt the request of Banshee andPolaris, Rev.

However, when thethe first mutant since M-Daywas born two new futures popped up. To explore these new futures,CyclopsandEmma Frostrecruited the help ofMadrox the Multiple Man.[2]Madrox andLayla Millertraveled toEagle PlazainDallas,Texasto meet with Forge. Madrox create two dupes to send into the two remaining mutant futures who would recover all the information they could and then die so their memories would transfer to Madrox. Cortex was one of these two dupes.[3][4]\nOnce this dupe had gained the information about this mutant future he attempted to return home. By unknown means he became trapped in a vortex where time did not exist.[4]It was here that he was captured byTrypandAnthony Falcone. Tryp and Falcone then made massive alterations to him and added cybernetic modification to turn him into adoomlock, a being that could alter time without creating divergent timelines. He had becomeCortex.\nCortex was then sentback in timewith instructions to kill specific key individuals whose progeny would become leaders of theSummers Rebellion. To accomplish this, Cortex could mentally control several people at once.\nA former mutant namedLenorewent toXF Investigations, claiming that someone was trying to kill her. She felt she was being followed, but every time she looked, it was a different person doing it. Her best friendCandy, another former mutant, was found dead of a gunshot wound which the police ruled a suicide. Lenore didn't believe it, because Candy had a pathological fear of guns. Before Candy died, she told Lenore that she thought she was being followed. Later,Lenore's mothershowed up at Lenore's apartment and attempted to shoot her, but was foiled byLongshot. Escaping, Lenore's mother tookDarwinhostage. At the last minute, she turned the gun on herself, but it backfired due to Longshot's luck powers. At the hospital,Monetattempted to read Lenore's mother's mind, but was overpowered and collapsed. When she woke up, she grabbed Longshot's throat and said \"Cortex.\"\nOnce she calmed down, Monet told the group that her violent outburst was because of psychic feedback that occurred after she had broken through a psychic barrier in Lenore's mother's mind, but that whatever was controlling her had fled. She then manipulated the group into moving Lenore out of her apartment and hiding her in a penthouse suite in an expensive hotel. There she tried to seduce Darwin, but he figured out acting out of character and was trying to get Lenore alone, and so resisted. Monet's body turned bright purple and became covered in tint lights and circuitry.\nDuring this same time, whileStrong GuyandRictorwere visitingRev. John MaddoxinVermont,Shatterstarburst through a window and tried to stab Rictor, saying only \"Cortex\".[5]A fight ensued, and Shatterstar was narrowly freed from Cortex's control.[6]\nRevealed to be a dupe of Mardox\nMeanwhile, inthe future, Multiple Man was tasked byCyclopswith discovering why certain people seemed to be blinking out and then back into existence. Multiple Man theorized that someone might be altering the past to affect the future. To find out more about time-travel, Madrox, Layla, andRuby Summersall traveled toDetroitto speak withDoctor Doom. They brought Doom with them toAtlantic City, but Doom soon betrayed them and summoned Cortex with the instruction to kill all the mutants.[7]\nCortex immediately killedTrevor Fitzroyand was then attacked by Ruby. Next, in very quick succession, Cortex comforted Madrox Prime, shot him, and killedSalvé. During the fray Falcone showed up with hisSentinels. Before the Sentinels could finish off the mutants, a freshly resurrected Trevor Fitzroy drained enough energy from Cortex to weaken him and open a portal to consume Falcone and his Sentinels. Just before it closed, Ruby threw Cortex into the portal.[4]\nCortex was originally a duplicate ofMadrox the Multiple Man, but because of alterations made byTrypandAnthony Falcone, with technology taken fromDoctor Doom, Cortex has gained the following powers:\nCortex opening a portal\nCortex shooting off energy"

It's assumed it was here he developed his strong sense of honor and pride as a warrior, to combat the constant violence and death in his life.\nDuring his time in the arenas, Shatterstar formed a relationship withGringrave, a popular female gladiator commonly known as the Smiling Executioner. Gringrave manipulated Shatterstar for her own ends, teaching him not to love or get attached to others, and live only for the thrill of the kill.[14][15]\nEventually, Shatterstar grew disillusioned with the idea of killing for sport. He escaped and joined the Blood Cadre Alliance, the rebel group that sought to overthrowMojo V's dictatorship. From there, he learned the Cadre's language and began taking part in missions, one of which sent him back in time to find the X-Men and get their assistance in defeating Mojo.[16]\nWith X-Force\nInstead of finding the X-Men, Shatterstar was transported back in time to Earth at the point just before Cable reorganized theNew MutantsintoX-Force. WithCable's assurance that they would help him defeat Mojo, Shatterstar became a founding member of the new team.[17]X-Force was also where he first metRictor. Shatterstar and Rictor formed a close friendship. Shatterstar learned Spanish specifically to communicate privately with Rictor.[18]After an awkward trip to a nightclub, Shatterstar also confessed to Ric that he wasn't emotionally prepared for physical interaction, due to his upbringing on Mojoworld. Rictor vowed to help Star with his development.[19]\nLater Shatterstar discovered, to his bewilderment, that he also had the memories of an Earthling namedBenjamin Russell.[8]Soon afterwards, Mojo made Cable and Shatterstar his prisoners and transformed them into digital images for one of his television programs. In the course of the show, Shatterstar was mortally wounded in combat. Mojo's sometime allySpiralteleported Cable and Shatterstar back into reality, where they regained their true forms. Spiral brought Cable, Shatterstar, Longshot, and the X-Force memberSirynto theWeisman Institute for the Criminally InsaneinRutland,Vermont.[citation needed]\nThere Spiral directed them to the bedside of one of its patients, a mutant named Benjamin Russell who had no living relatives, had been in a coma since his powers had emerged, and, curiously, looked identical to Shatterstar. Longshot transferred Shatterstar's \"uemeur,\" or soul, into Benjamin Russell's body, and the two became one. Apparently Shatterstar's body merged with Russell's as well, for the resulting body bore the starburst pattern that Shatterstar had around his left eye and his hair lengthened greatly. Restored to full health and consciousness, and feeling \"whole\" for the first time in his life, Shatterstar resumed his work as a member of X-Force.[20]\nShatterstar accompanied Rictor to the Richter home inMexicoto try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business.[21][22]Presumably they succeeded, though it's not known why they later parted.\nShatterstar was later inMadripoor, earning his money by fighting in arenas. He was sought out by Spiral, who had one of her agents make Shatterstar believe she wanted to kill him. With a fake quest, Spiral lured Shatterstar to an alternate universe she had conquered and ruled. On that Earth, Spiral had also killed most of that worlds heroes and mutants. That Earth's Shatterstar had been killed as well. He was found by that Earth's rebel forces, including Cable and some others he knew from X-Force. Together, they eventually defeated Spiral.[23]Upon returning to the mainstream Earth, Shatterstar was contacted by Cable, who requested that Shatterstar temporarily join him on a mission to defeat theSkornn. Shatterstar agreed, but first Cable wanted him to train with monks on Mount Xixabangma. After those monks were killed by Skornn's worshipers, Shatterstar was reunited with his old team and they eventually killed the Skornn.[24]\nFollowingM-Dayand the passing of theSuperhuman Registration Act, Shatterstar teamed up with former X-Force alliesDominoandCalibanto breakThe 198out of the encampment set up for mutants on the grounds of theXavier Institute. They took the escapees to a secret base provided to them byCaptain AmericaviaNick Fury. While fightingO*N*Ehe nearly killedMicromax, claiming that while there is no such thing as murder during war, he had only meant to disable him.[25]\nAt some unknown point,Cortexgained control over Shatterstar and sent him to attack his friends. While searching for Madrox, Rictor andStrong GuydiscoveredFather Maddox, a dupe of Madrox's, that had been living in New England as a priest. They decided to investigate further, hoping to find the whereabouts of Madrox Prime. Upon meeting Father Maddox, a masked man crashed through the window with swords ablaze. After a brief battle, the attacker was revealed to be Shatterstar, possessed by Cortex.[26]\nRictor and Shatterstar kissing\nOnce Shatterstar was broken out of his trance-like state, and recognized Rictor, the two embraced one another and finally shared a kiss.[27]\nShortly afterwards Shatterstar transported X-Factor toLatveria, where he remained withLayla MillerandDoctor Doomfor a while.[28]Layla and Shatterstar next appeared atDublin Airportto saveTerry CassidyfromTrask'sMutant Response Division.[29]After they escaped, the trio rejoined the rest of X-Factor back in New York City.[30]\nRictor and Shatterstar began a steady romantic relationship after Shatterstar's return though not without its difficulties. Rictor, having finally come to terms with his sexual identity, wanted a stable monogamous relationship with Shatterstar. Shatterstar, on the other hand, found himself interested in a more open relationship that would allow him to explore other sexual possibilities. The two resolved that they would work things out, and proceeded to make up both emotionally and physically. However, before they could get very far, the two were interrupted when a pregnantWolfsbanebarged in.[5]\nWolfsbane was pregnant withHrimhari's child, although she led Rictor and the others to believe he was the father.[31]This lie did not last long as a brief encounter between Hrimhari and Shatterstar inNiffleheimcleared up the question of paternity.[32]\nAfter the birth and abandonment ofWolfsbane's son, Shatterstar and Rictor volunteered (unsolicited) to accompany Wolfsbane in searching for her child.[33]The trio first traveled toHeland receive a mystic amulet to locate the child, and finally found him inSproul State ForestinPennsylvania. Wolfsbane's son,Tier, was being tracked independently by bothDarwinandVanorabut Shatterstar and Rictor were able to fight off attacks from both, and Tier escaped unharmed with his mother. Wolfsbane then chose to leave X-Factor and raise Tier with the aid and protection ofJack Russell, the Werewolf By Night.[34]Shatterstar and Rictor, however, returned to X-Factor Investigations in New York City.[35]\nAfter Rahne and her son, Tier, returned to X-Factor to seek sanctuary from Darwin and other would-be assassins, all of X-Factor were transported toHell. TheHell Lordsvied to gain overall control by killing Tier, and X-Factor fought their demon armies to protect him. When Shatterstar attackedMephistoto free Tier from a magical prison, Mephisto seemingly vaporised him, before doing the same to Rictor.[36]\nIn fact, Rictor and Shatterstar both ended up going back in time and being transported to theMojoverse. Shatterstar was again brainwashed into attacking Rictor - this time in a televised gladiatorial battle. Rictor managed to incapacitate Shatterstar, before escaping the arena with help from Mojoverse rebels, including the Longshot of this era. Whilst he was unconscious, Shatterstar was brought toArize, who cloned him (and used some of his DNA to create Longshot). Shatterstar awoke in time to use his powers to escape an attack byMojoandSpiral, and Shatterstar transported them forward in time. In this new time period, Rictor came acrossDazzlergiving birth to Shatterstar as a baby. Rictor and Shatterstar helped to deliver the baby, before Shatterstar erased Dazzler's memory. To maintain the timeline as it was meant to take place, Shatterstar then transported himself, Rictor, and his infant self forward in time again - by 100 years - to the period he grew up in.[13]\nShatterstar and Rictor somehow made it back to Earth and their own time, and joined their fellow mutants - including former teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane - inNew Tian.[37]After New Tian was dismantled, Rictor told Iceman that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.[38]\nShatterstar rejoined the X-Men in New York to investigate signs that thePhoenix Forcemight have returned to Earth, checking the Manhattan sewers in a team with Dazzler and Strong Guy.[39]\nRictor and Shatterstar try to navigate their newly separated status\nFeeling unsure about himself and his relationship with Rictor, Shatterstar ended things between them.[40]Newly single, Shatterstar bought a property using the earnings he'd made and named it Manor Crossing. He offered the rooms to multi-dimensional refugees like himself and served as both landlord and protector to his tenants. When Shatterstar's tenants were kidnapped by the Mojoworld mercenary group theDeath Sponsorsand their leader, former allyGringrave, Shatterstar vowed to bring them home.[7]\nWith help from Rictor, Shatterstar followed the group to the world of Horus IV, which was ruled by theGrandmaster. Grandmaster tasked Gringrave with the kidnapping, hoping to use a gladiatorial battle between the enemies to satisfy the Horuvians lust for bloody conflict.[40]\nAfter Shatterstar killed Gringrave in revenge for her actions,[15]Grandmaster himself entered the arena, seeking to gain control of Shatterstar for all eternity. But Shatterstar refused to concede and defeated Grandmaster by teleporting them toEarth-1218, a world where super-powered beings do not exist and Grandmaster's god powers could not work. Shatterstar was then rescued by Rictor, who reached out across the universe to find him and bring him home.[41]\nShatterstar was shocked when his former mentor Cable was slain while attempting to protect the time-displaced Iceman.[42]When it was revealed that a younger version of Cable was responsible, Shatterstar partnered with his former X-Force teammates to hunt downKid Cableand have him answer for his crime. During the search, Shatterstar was turned into one ofAhab's mutant-hunting hounds and attempted to kill the time-displaced Jean Grey.[43]Shatterstar was subdued by Cannonball and freed of Ahab's influence.[44]\nAfter Kid Cable returned the time-displaced X-Men to their timeline and disappeared, Shatterstar joined a newly reformed X-Force to resume their search for him. They found Kid Cable in the small nation ofTransia, working withDeathlokto uncover how the country's military had gotten ahold of weapons from Kid Cable's future. Shatterstar and his team were forced to team up with Kid Cable when they were framed for the murder of the Transian president.[45]\nShatterstar struggled to trust Kid Cable and accept him as the real Nathan Summers,[46]but the pair worked together with the rest of X-Force to defeat the Transian military. They learned the military's futuristic weapons were being supplied byStryfethrough a time portal.[47]Strye took Kid Cable into the future through the portal and X-Force resolved to rescue both him and the kidnappedRachel Summers. Shatterstar was prepared to give his life for the potentially one-way mission, feeling like there was little left for him since Rictor's presumed death.[48]\nX-Force defeated Stryfe, rescued both Kid Cable and Rachel Summers, and found a way to return to their timeline. Shatterstar finally declared his trust in Kid Cable and forgave him for murdering the older Cable. Shatterstar also resolved to return to the present, stop seeking distractions, and instead focus on grieving Rictor properly.[49]\nShatterstar was of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation ofKrakoaupon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.[50]\nAt some point, Shatterstar returned to Mojoworld, becoming the dimension's most subscribed and top-ranked live-streamer. However, Shatterstar began to feel trapped by the celebrity status he had created for himself. When fellow live-streamerWind Dancerarranged for her own death to satisfy her fans, Shatterstar secretly informed the KrakoanX-Factorteam so they could claim her body beforeArizecould produce a clone and force Wind Dancer to resume her stream. X-Factor were successful in their mission, but had to leave Shatterstar behind in Mojoworld. They promised to one day return and rescue him.[51]The team eventually made good on this promise coming back alongside the New Mutants and arranging the freedom of all mutants there. After this they recruited Shatterstar to defeatThe Morrigan, freeingSirynfrom her control.[52]He was then rewarded with memories of his past, which lead to him seeking Rictor out during the Hellfire Gala,[53]after which they sat on the coastline of the newly created Braddock Isle and caught up with one another.[54]\nReunited with Rictor, Shatterstar joinedExcaliburin their battle againstKing ArthurinOtherworld.[55]He became one ofCaptain Britain'sKnights of Xand helped her to liberate Otherworld.[56]\nShatterstar is a mutant,[58]the naturally born son of the mutant Dazzler and the artificially-engineered Biped Longshot.[13]As a result, he was born with many of the superhuman traits Longshot was engineered to possess, in addition to his own unique mutant abilities. Shatterstar also merged withBenjamin Russell, with whom he shares an unexplained connection. Russell was also reportedly a mutant.[59]Russell's mutant powers are unknown, but Shatterstar did not appear to gain or lose any abilities when the two merged. Although his teleporting ability surfaced after he bonded with Russell, the two events happened 13 years apart and were not noticeably connected.[60]"

Originally a member of theDoom Patrol, he joined theTeen Titansafter the death of the other Patrollers.\nAs a child, Garfield Logan contracted a rare illness calledSakutiaand was cured by a serum from a green monkey. This serum had the unintended effect of turning his skin and hair green and gave him the ability to change into any animal form.\nOriginally known as and reusing the alias, Beast Boy, he was adopted byElasti-GirlandMento, members of theDoom Patrol.[1]He later joinedTitans West, and was part of the NewTeen Titansassembled byRaven. Upon joining the latter, took the name Changeling. He remained with various incarnations of the team, forming a close friendship withCyborg.\nHe later began using the name Beast Boy again. Following a failed attempt to recreate Titans West as \"Titans L.A.,\" he rejoined the main team.\nHe had also worked as an actor, playing the role of the alien Tork in the TV seriesSpace Trek: 2022. The series was abruptly canceled when it was sued for plagiarizing other science fiction shows.\nWhatever team he is part of, he likes to joke around with people and make jokes of the situations the team get themselves into. However, this is only a facade. In reality, Beast Boy has suffered many hardships in his life. Both his real parents passed away, and hisfoster mother, whom Garfield became very close to, died in battle along with virtually all of the other Doom Patrol members, while Gar was also part of the team. His foster father was driven mad by a helmet he used to fight enemies. He also fell in love withTerra(a member of the Teen Titans) and was heartbroken to discover that she was a traitor working forDeathstroke. Even after her death, he refused to believe for a long time that she was a traitor and blamed Slade for using her, until they eventually sat down and came to an understanding. As a result of all of this, he used his jokes to cover the fact that he was scared of losing anyone else he grew close to. Despite all of his hardships, Garfield was friendly and upbeat.\nHis best friend was Cyborg. He was also close with Bette \"Flamebird\" Kane, a former Titan who helped save his life on an adventure inLos Angeles.\nAfter trying to hold together a ragtag band of Titans, onceRobinreturned, Beast Boy left the team to rejoin the Doom Patrol and aid his adoptive parents. Following attacks on various former Titans, it was determined that the sons ofTrigonwere trying to destroy the group to establish a name for themselves. The Titans decided to reform to combat the threat. At the same time, Beast Boy tried to reconcile with Raven.\nThe newly formedTitansslowly broke apart, with Gar rejoining theTeen Titansin order to polish them up, after seeing their performance under the leadership ofWonder Girl.[2]Raven followed soon after.\nDuring the events ofBlackest Night, Beast Boy and the Titans were forced to fight Terra, who was resurrected from death as a member of the evilBlack Lantern Corps[3].\n\n\n\n\nDoom PatrolmemberThis character has been at some point primarily a member of theDoom Patrol.

Around this same time, Doug's father agreed to undergo voluntary sterilization as anX-Genecarrier, but hismothercommitted suicide a year later. Despite being pegged as a low risk, Doug was able to escape by subverting one of the guards,Eileen Haloke. She was part-Navajo, and Ramsey forged some sort of emotional bond with her by speaking to her in the Navajo tongue. She freed him from his cell and then accompanied him when he escaped from the compound. She was sighted with him on numerous occasions thereafter.\nHaloke wasn't with Ramsey in the Finger Lakes area ofNew York Statea year later when he was at ground zero for a meteor strike. First forces arriving on the scene found Ramsey apparently infected by some sort of carbon/siliconalien matter. This alien matter was able to replicate in a quasi-viral manner, and it spread through Ramsey's whole system in the space of minutes.\nThe units on site were waiting for the arrival of Hazmat teams so that they could apprehend Ramsey without risk of infection, but they suffered simultaneous failure of all electronic systems.

Moments after Ramsey began speaking in an indecipherable language, the Exonim units turned on each other, discharging all their weapons in a three-second exchange of fire which caused a forty-meter wide crater.[2]\nTranslation:Cypher was at first amutantwith some power related to the acquisition of language, and was for example able to speak in Navajo tongue.[2]\nOnce infected by thealien matter, Warlock was able to spread, modifying his powers:\nThe entity hosted in Cypher is also able to protect him from massive damages and conflagrations,[2]and can extend itself in deadly tendrils.[1]"

He decided to form his own team of heroes to find the lost gems. Lockheed joined him alongside:Throg,Redwing,Hairball, andMs. Lion. Looking for a second gem lead them to theSavage Land, and a T-Rex.[1]Zabuarrived and helped them chase off the dinosaur and was invited to join the team. They sensed the location of the next gem in the past so they transport into the prehistoric past and ran intoDevil Dinosaur, who happened to be protecting its nest, which inconveniently is the location of the gem. They managed to distract Devil Dinosaur while Lockjaw and Ms. Lion got the gem. They then transported themselves back to the present, only to appear over the open ocean.[2]They crashed into the ocean, but were saved byNamor's Honor Guard turtles, who agreed to help them find two more of the gems. Unfortunately, being near the den ofGiganto, the turtles flee. Hairball finally freaked out about so much water, waking up Giganto, who swallows them. Meanwhile, Ms. Lion found the gems, and they teleported away to the location of the final gem, theWhite House. The final gem was located in theBo's collar. Bo took off barking out the front door, and the Pet Avengers followed, only to run headlong intoThanos.[3]He was the  previous owner of the Gems when united as theInfinity Gauntlet, intervenes and killed Ms. Lion. The other animals were angered by this act and used the Gems to strand Thanos in an alternate dimension and subsequently revive their comrade. Retrieving the final Gem, the group decided to separate, but not before Throg advised that they now share a psychic link and will reunite if needed. Ms. Lion resurrected by Hairball via theSoul Gemdubs the group thePet Avengers. Lockjaw presented the Gems to a surprised Reed Richards.[4]"

At first the process seemed to have no effect, but he eventually learned he had gained the ability to come up with whatever power was necessary to resolve a given situation.[2]\nThe Kingpin sent the Answer to engageSpider-Manand test his abilities. At first the Answer struggled, but each time Spidey attacked him, he gained the ability to counter him. TheBlack Catjumped into the fight, but the Answer escaped, having taken both their measures.[3]\nThe Kingpin planned to use long-term exposure to the Black Cat's bad luck power to cause problems for Spidey. He had the Answer arrange a plot to keep them together. He coerced the Black Cat to agree to the ruse, because of her debt to the Kingpin. The Answer held her prisoner with a fake bomb and then allowed Spider-Man to \"save\" her. The plan worked, and Spidey and the Black Cat were on good terms once again.[4]\nThe Kingpin had the Answer use the distraction to steal the corpse of the cyborgSilvermaneto use as a potential assassin. The Kingpin's agents succeeded in partially reviving him and applied a submission collar on Silvermane's neck to force his compliance. Silvermane lost control and soughtDagger, whose energies held a connection to his life force. Answer reasoned that the energy manipulated by Dagger might have been able to revive the Kingpin's comatose wifeVanessa Fisk. The Answer set a trap and captured Dagger for the Kingpin. The Answer infused his own light energy into Dagger but this backfired. Dagger absorbed all of the Answer's life force, apparently killing him. The energy released in the process broke the link with Silvermane and restored him to life.[5]\nThe Answer survived as a discorporated, unconscious being of energy. The implosion of theMultiverseMatrix[6]caused an energy disturbance that restored the Answer's awareness. He discovered the means to communicate with the corporeal world via a computer chip, formerly used byDoctor Octopusto control hisAdamantiumarms. He made a deal with Octopus, promising to free him from prison and restore his destroyed mechanical arms in exchange for helping him regain his physical form. Octopus duped a scientistGuardsmaninto creating the machine which restored the Answer to life. The Answer sought to betray Octopus but he was ultimately defeated and imprisoned.[7]\nAnswer was one of the escapees from theRyker's Islandbreakout . He began to rob banks with his sidekick Joe Self in order to impress theOwl, then current ruler of New York's underworld. He managed to get the Owl's attention, and was waiting in a bar with his sidekick before phoning him back, but was confronted byToxin, the heroic symbiote. Toxin told the Answer that if he gave him the answer to his problem, he would let him walk away. Toxin revealed to the Answer that he was a former police officer bonded to a symbiote, and that he couldn't seem to keep the symbiote from misbehaving, and that it was bringing out the worst in him. The Answer told Toxin that the solution was to kill himself. Toxin didn't keep his word, and sent the Answer back to theRaft. Toxin did attempt suicide, as per the Answer's solution, but the symbiote saved him.[8]\nHe had a brief romantic liaison withRuby Thursdayat some point in the past, to which she called an end. She approached him and asked him to fetchA.I.M.'s procurement budget for her, which he did. Soon afterward, word got to him thatBullseyewas out to assassinate him, but he later discovered that Bullseye was actually hired by A.I.M. to assassinate Ruby instead, and wanted to get to her through him. Bullseye decapitated Ruby, but he let the Answer keep her head. The Answer went into hiding to search for a way to reactivate her head.[1]\nAfter the superhumanCivil War, Answer joinedHood's criminal armyand helped them fight theNew AvengersatDoctor Strange'sSanctum Sanctorum.[9]He was eventually captured when his team tried to helpIron PatriotattackAsgard.[10]\nAnswer was imprisoned inS.H.I.E.L.D.'sPleasant Hill. He and the other villains, after being free from the altered realities, tried to escape but were stopped by theAvengers.[11]"

He admired theU-Men, but was unwilling to participate in their religious rituals and the modus operandi of their transformation (harvesting and implanting mutant organs).\nLobe's \"mutant\" team\nWith John Sublime gone, Lobe founded a society, theSublime Corporation, intending to make a reality of Sublime's ideal, and profit from it. Lobe recruited four associates:Verre,Thug,Burst, andBouncing Betty.[1]\nHe purchased the remainingPredators Xfrom the astoundingFacilityand infused them with nanomachine spies. He then led his team to captureScalphunterand forced him to fly a jet containing the Predators X toUtopia. After the X-Men defeated the Predators, the nanomachines were released from the bodies and spied on all the mutants, analyzing their fighting styles, powers, and DNA. The nanobots then transmitted to Lobe, who was able to use it to enhance his team's capabilities, and give himselfWolverine's healing factor, with the ultimate goal being to replicate their powers for everybody on Earth.[2][3]\nThe X-Men Wolverine,Psylocke, andColossus, helped byFantomex, assaulted Lobe's building inNew York City. Once Fantomex destroyed Lobe's central computer, his team lost their fighting edge and were defeated. Lobe then releasedHX-N1, the influenza-based mutant plague and also a mutant powers suppressant, revealing that he was working using John Sublime's works and ideals. He and his team escaped, and his base exploded. The explosion was green like the plague gas, and was released high above the streets ofManhattanfrom a skyscraper, but that didn't seem to worry the X-Men at the time. The plague quickly infected numerous Utopian mutants.[citation needed]\nAt this time, Lobe also debuted his imitationNew X-MeninSan Francisco, five humans who were given copies of the original X-Men's powers using a genetically tailored drug. Lobe then contactedCyclopsand offered him the cure for the mutant plague in exchange for sole commercial rights to the mutant genome, in order to use it to legally sell his mutant power-inducing drug, theXperience.[citation needed]\nLobe is augmented with cybernetic enhancement fromJohn Sublimeto mimic the powers of amutant.[citation needed]"

On the island he was successful in evolving numerous monstrous creatures. During the transport of his newly created life forms to an orbiting space ark,S.H.I.E.L.D.agents,Nick FuryandJimmy Woo, by chance discovered Centurius' island where they were forced to crash land their aircraft.\nThe pair of agents initially attempted to convince Centurius to return to civilization with them, but when the geneticist's plot to destroy all life on Earth was revealed, Fury and his companions attack. In a ploy to defeat the agents, Centurius attempted to transform himself into a \"superior being\" using a device called the \"Evolutionizer\", but instead of evolving he \"de-evolved\" into a handful of protoplasmic slime.[1][6]\nLater, Centurius somehow \"re-evolved\" into human form and as a member of the group known as theConspiracy; he clashed with the heroic monster hunterUlysses Bloodstonewhen the Conspiracy tried to gain untold power by gathering and reuniting the lost fragments of theBloodgem, a mystic jewel from another dimension. However, The Conspiracy's efforts ultimately failed when their essences were absorbed by an enormous crystalline creature created from the Bloodgem. Ulysses Bloodstone succeeded in shattering the Bloodgem creature which apparently killed Centurius and the other members of the Conspiracy.[7][8]\nYears later,Captain Americadiscovered the skeletal remains of Centurius while exploring the Conspiracy's abandoned underground base.[9]\nMuch later, Centurius was found to not be dead after all and held as a prisoner at theRaft, a prison for super powered criminals. He was able to escape the prison with numerous other inmates.[10][11]\nThe Hood and his motley army recovered, his army unhappy with the Hood's leadership.[15]The Hood put Centurius,Chemistro,Demonicus, theAnswer, andLiving Laseron a special project, promising to be in touch soon.[16]During theSecret Invasion, he was among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invadingSkrullforce. He joined with the Hood's Gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting theDark Avengersinstead.[17]Centurius partied at one of Hood's safehouses and passed out after drinking too much.[18]\nHe was later seen conferring with the Hood regarding thezombie virus. Centurius advised the Hood not to pursue the virus, but the Hood was compelled byDormammuto procure the virus fromBlack Talondespite Black's warnings.[19]\nA furious Hood returned to his army and killedJonas Harrowfor his betrayal. Hood chided the criminals for their panicked actions, and told them they now had to followNorman Osborn's orders. Osborn told them to hunt theunregistered heroesand bring them back, dead or alive.[20]The Hood used theNorn Stonesto give those in his army the ability to track down the targeted heroes, increasing their own strength and power as well.[21]\nHe escaped together with several other inmates who were members of the Thunderbolts. Due to a failure of the teleportation technology of their tower, caused byMan-Thing, the tower began to move in time as well as in space.

Following the war, he and a fellow veteran, James K. Powell, were in theArizonadesert to prospect for gold, but they were attacked by the nativeApache. Carter was cornered inside a cave but found himself unable to move and suddenly his astral form was transported to theplanet Mars, called Barsoom by its inhabitants.[2]\nUpon arriving to Barsoom, Carter came across an incubator for the Green Martian eggs. There he was captured by the war-like tribe the Tharks. While with the tribe, Carter used his increased strength and agility to impress the Green Martians, gaining their trust, and even befriending one of their chiefsTars Tarkas. From the young Green Martian woman namedSolahe learned the language and telepathic abilities, while he also taught them how to properly treat their animals, and even gained a pet namedWoola. One day, the Tharks captured one of the survivors from a fleet of fliers that had been attacked. That prisoner was the Red Martian princess of HeliumDejah Thoriswith whom Carter immediately fell deeply in love. Being determined to free her and return her to her people, Carter with the assistance of Sola, broke Dejah out and escaped from the Tharks.[3]\nFinding themselves lost, Carter was captured by another Green Martian tribe, the Warhoons, and was forced to fight for their gladiatorial games. During the games, Carter met and befriended a Red Martian man and fellow fighterKantos. The two were eventually pitted against each other. They faked their fighting until dark, when Kan pretend to kill Carter, earning his freedom. Carter later managed to escape himself and wandering through the wastes he cashed into a battle between Tars' Tharks and the Warhoons, helping him in the fight. Carter and Tars decided to return to the Tharks' city and confronted the corrupt ruler Tal Hajus. Carter managed to convince the Tharks that Tars was better suited for the position of Jeddak, leading to the two Green Martians fighting in a duel to the death. During the fight, Carter revealed to Tars that Sola was his daughter, infuriating him as Tal had made advances to her. This gave him enough willpower to overpower Tal and kill him, gaining the title of Jeddak.[4]\nLearning that Dejah was to be wed to Prince Sab Than of Zodanga, the enemy nation of Helium, Carter with the assistance of Tars and the Tharks warriors, attacked Zodanga. They interrupted the marriage, and Carter fought Than in a battle. Carter was able to defeat the prince, but didn't kill due to Martian custom, leaving Tars to finish him. Carter and his allies brought Dejah back to Helium where celebration soon ensued. Dejah's grandfather,Tardos Mors, formed an alliance between Helium and the Tharks, while Carter married Dejah, making him the prince of Helium.[4]\nTwo years after his first arrival to Barsoom, a group of Green Martians abducted Carter's wife Dejah Thoris and companion Tars Tarkas. Looking for the abductors Carter ran through the ruined city of Zodanga where he came across a group of Warhoons. Fighting them, Carter spared one of the Warhoons for interrogation, learning that Dejah and Tars were locked in the tower of law. Dejah was being interrogated by the Warhoons about the Atmosphere factory before Carter came to rescue both her and Tars. They then learn that behind all of this was an enemy who sought to kill of life in Barsoom.[2]\nIn the city, the three noticed a Red Martian man and suspecting his involvement in the abduction, capture him and bring him in Helium to be trialed. However, while imprisoned the man ripped off his prosthetic arm, revealing a hidden weapon he used to escape. Carter and Tars then went to the atmosphere factory which was being attacked by theWhite Apes. They fought the monsters, until Dejah Thoris arrived on her Helimitic airship. Unfortunately for her, the airship crashed, leading to her getting captured by the apes which were being controlled by the one armed man. Carter attempted to rescue her but was knocked out unconscious off the roof of the factory.[5]\nCarter was captured by the one armed man, whose name was revealed to be Stara Kan, a warrior of Zodanga who had been wounded by Carter when he freed Dejah, and imprisoned him in his palace. Fearing about Dejah's safety, Carter broke free from his chains and killed Kan's beasts. Sadly, Kan had put an obedience collar around Carter's neck which forced Carter to obey every command of Kan. Carter was undeterred and fought Kan, and after some struggle managed to beat him.[6]However, seeing that his wife had been taken somewhere else and her life endangered, Carter decided to obey Kan for now and embarked with him on his warship and assisting his army in pillaging various cities against his will. When attacking the city of Zeere, Carter found all of its people under the thrall of an alien monster named T'ralla. He slayed the monster and freed the people who went on to destroy the idols they erected of T'ralla, forcing Kan and Carter to retreat.[7]\nGrowing frustrated, Carter escaped from the ship and went to Kan's base. There he overheard Kan ordering a group Green Martians to just kill the imprisoned Dejah. Carter broke inside to prevent them from killing his wife, and fought Kan. Despite Kan's best effort to subdue Carter, the latter fought through the control and successfully beat him to death. Despite this, Kan had the last laugh as he was the only one who knew where Dejah was imprisoned.[8]Carter returned to Helium, but agents of theCouncil of Five, the same society that had assisted Kan, had arrived before him to spread the information about Carter assisting the pirates. Being labelled a traitor Carter was attacked by the citizens, forcing him hide. During this, a pack of savage Thoats were unleashed on the defenceless citizens, leading to Carter attempting to lead them away but found that he was unable to control them. As the Thoats were directed to the hatchery, Carter directly fought them to ensure the children's safety. The crazed crowd didn't care and still attacked him.[1]\nThankfully he was rescued by Sola and treated by a doctor, but was bedridden due to blood loss. While he recovered, Dejah was able to free herself from the Council of Five's imprisonment and spotted by Carter's loyal friends. Informed that Dejah was fighting their enemies at the atmosphere factory, Carter quickly made his way there to come to her aid. The couple fought together against their enemies, until the battle ended in their victory.[9]Helium was eventually attacked by the Council's floating city of the Ebony Island. Carter led his forces during the fight, and the floating city was successfully destroyed.[10]\nAt night, Carter was awoken by an agent of the Council who told him that his master wanted to see him. Intrigued, Carter decided to follow the creature and went to a hidden cave where he was confronted by the Great One, the founder of the Council. He believed himself to be the prophesized savior of Barsoom meant to save the planet by destroying all life and recreate it from scratch. Carter refused to let him accomplish his goal, and so the two fought. Although both of them became exhausted, Carter got the upper hand, prompting the Great One to try to escape on his flier. Carter wouldn't let him escape and jumped on his flier. On his way, the Great One became delusional and began believing that he had arrived at the Tree of Life which had birthed him. The Great One crashed into the site, killing himself, leaving Carter to jump off into a nearby body of water.[11]\nCarter, wanting to be left alone with his thoughts for a while, flew through the Martian sky on his royal flier. He then noticed a White Martian man fighting a group of Green Martians and came to his aid. However, after rescuing the man, whose name wasPan Dan Chee, he was taken prisoner by other White Martians and was brought to the Jeddak of Horz, Ho Ran Kim, who ordered the execution of both Carter and Pan in order to keep their existence a secret. They were brought to the pits where they were attacked by ulsios. They managed to kill them, and attempted to find a way out but instead came across the tomb of an ancient warrior. Carter took the sword from the warrior's body and sought the way out, but was stopped by Pan, telling him that he couldn't allow Carter to leave and expose his people. Although Carter promised to not tell the secret to anyone, Pan was unconvinced and the two fought. Carter defeated Pan but refused to kill him out of nobility. Suddenly they heard a laughter and following it they found an old man named Lum Tar O who had been living in the pits for years and offered the two men some water. However, the water had been drugged as Lum Tar O recognized Carter's stolen sword as that of the jeddak Hor Kai Lan. Carter managed to fight the effects off and fought the old man off. Regaining themselves Carter and Pan witnessed all of the dead came to life, which included Hor Kai Lan and deified daughter S-Lana. While Pan marveled at S-Lana, Carter was attacked by Lan's men after he attempted to tell them that they've been dead for five hundred years. Having found the doorway outside, Carter showed Lan the land of Mars which used to be covered with water. This only angered Lan more and tried to slay Carter, forcing the latter to flee. To astonishment the environment around them began changing to between the present and that of Lan's. Time caught up to the deceased and soon they turned to dust, but to Carter's dismay Pan remained by Lana's side and perished alongside them, leaving Carter to return to his people on foot.[12]\nAfter falling off Helium's flagship when he attempted to help his men during a storm, Carter found himself in the strange land of Bantoom where he witnessed enslaved headless men. While wandering through the land, Carter encounteredAardandTal Tarag. Aard told Carter his origin as a Kaldane, a race of disembodied heads that attached themselves to the headless bodies of the Rykor race, and how he was outcast by their evil ruler Taak after falling in love with Saar. Tal Tarag then took over the explanation, telling Carter of how he and his lover Vala Dia had their brains removed and replaced with Saar and another Kaldane, while his own brain was placed into the body of a White Ape by the scientist Ras Thavas. Learning that Taak planned to use his people to infiltrate the Red Martian society and wanting to bring justice to his newfound friends, Carter decided to aid Aard and Tarag in attacking the Kaldane. During the ambush, the trio confronted Saar in the body of Vala Dia and the other Kaldane in Tarag's body. They tried to bring Saar to her senses, but Taak himself appeared to them. Utilizing his telepathic abilities Taak forced Aard to come to him before striking the lower Kaldane. He then revealed to Tarag that his lover's body along with his own had been irreversibly mutated by the Kaldane possessing them, and Dia was forever gone. Enraged Tarag lunged towards Taak, causing them both to fall to a nearby pit and into their deaths. Alone, Carter fought through the remaining Kaldane before reaching Tarag's ship which he used to escape. Some days later, he was found by a scouting party from Helium and was reunited with his wife.[13]\nEventually Dejah Thoris laid an egg containing their future child, filling Carter with happiness. Following his time helping the miners at the Korz plateau, Carter decided to fly back to Helium. On his way back home, he saw other flying ships chasing a poor defenceless woman. Carter fought off the ships and rescued the young woman who revealed her name to be Klys. As gratitude for saving her Klys brought Carter to her hidden city of Paradise which was solely populated by Martian women. Once there, they were attacked by the flying vampire monsters, but Carter was able to defend the women. Klys and her people then utilized their hypnotizing perfume to seduce Carter and have him under their control. The women brought Carter to the underground sacrificial obelisk surrounded by lava where Klys revealed herself as the matriarch of Paradise and sought to sacrifice him to their goddess to ensure her people's safety. Carter tried to fight back but was too weak and soon was left chained to the obelisk. Thankfully, while all of the women danced as part of the ritual, Dejah and Tars, who had come looking for Carter, infiltrated the city and came to his aid. While Dejah battled Klys and Tars fought the flying monsters, the goddess emerged from the fiery pit. Klys managed to mortally wound Dejah, enraging Carter who broke free of his restraints and held to his dying wife. Seeing this great love, the goddess healed Dejah and brought the couple to safety, telling everyone present that she never wanted any sacrifice but only acts of love. Realizing her wrongdoings, Klys apologized to Carter and vowed to bring her people out of secrecy to form relations with other cities. In the aftermath, the couple and their companion returned home.[14]\nOne day, the Atmosphere Factory suddenly broke down and shut down, resulting in the inhabitants of Barsoom to die from asphyxiation. Carter broke inside the facility through a telepathic code to bring in an engineer to fix. Unfortunately Carter suffocated and died during this. He woke back in the cave where he had originally been transported. Carter became a wealthy man thanks to his service in the war and lived in a house in Virginia, but still longed to return to Mars and be reunited with his wife.[4]He lived on Earth for ten years before finally returning back to Mars. In his will he left the house to his nephew Edgar and instructed him to buried in a specialized tomb with air ventilation and that could be opened from the inside.[15]\nUpon returning to Mars, Carter found himself in the unfamiliar Valley Dor where he saw a group of Green Martians being ambushed by the Plant Men on the River Iss. Carter attempting to intervene but only one of the Martians survived who turned out to be his old friend Tars, having taken a pilgrimage to the river to find Carter. The duo then came across the Therns, a race of White Martians that had deceit most of the Martians into believing that they were gods and had them take pilgrimages into the river Iss to enter their paradise only to be either slain by the local beasts or captured and enslaved by them. Carter and Tars saved one of their slavesThuviaand escaped, which a group of Black Martian pirates attacked the Therns. The trio attempted to hijack a couple of the pirates' fliers, with Carter saving the Therns princess Phaidor and capturing the pirate Xodar. From Xodar Carter learned that the Black Martians known as the First Born, similar to the Therns, thought of themselves as gods, and Xodar revealed to him that Phaidor was the daughter of the Therns' high priest. Carter, Xodar and Phaidor were captured by the First Born and brought to the self-proclaimed goddess of MarsIssuswho imprisoned Carter and made Xodar his slave for his betrayal.[16]\nWhile in prison, as Carter and Xodar became friends they encountered a fellow inmate named Carthoris who later turned out to be Carter and Dejah's son. Father and son were forced to fight in gladiatorial fights, but the first spectacle was the slaughter of defenseless women. Carter became furious over this, and got in the way to protect them. This inspired Carthoris to incite a slave revolt and together fought their way to Issus herself. They planned to kill her, but she escaped, leaving Carter and Carthoris to go through some underground tunnels, going back to the prisons and freeing Xodar. The trio stole a flying vessel and left Omean, and their way they encountered Thuvia, telling them that Tars had been captured by the Warhoons. Carter went to rescue his friend, leaving his party at the hills. He fought the Warhoons and rescued Tars but after regrouping with the others they find themselves being pursued by their enemies, while Thuvia was missing. Thankfully they were saved by a navy fleet from Helium led by Carter's friend Kantos and the Zodangan Zat Arras, the latter seeking to have Carter executed due to returning from the Valley Dor being outlawed. On their way back to Helium, Carter learned that his father and grandfather-in-law had been absent from Helium to search for Carthoris and Dejah was taking a pilgrimage to the valley in search for him.[17]\nJohn Carter was originally an average human with some firearm skill thanks to his time serving in the Civil War. After being transported to Mars Carter gained an enhanced physiology:"

Living as a nomad in the desert, he stumbled upon the ancient temple of Ka, where he discovered a mystical gem, the legendary Ka Stone. Placing it on his forehead, he was transformed into the immortal being who would become known as the Sphinx.[2]Dazed by the powerful energies surging through his body, the magician collapsed. He was found and nursed back to health by a lonely outcast woman.[3]\nThis woman, whose name is not recorded, fell in love with Sphinx, but he could not return her love and walked out of her life. For the rest of her days, she sought and dreamed of him. She finally died of old age, lonely and bitter, only to reawaken in the body of an Egyptian boy from a wealthy family. In this life, she became an architect and scholar, and in her researches, she located the lost temple of Ka. She deciphered the cryptic parchments found in the temple, and uncovered many of the Ka Stone's secrets. Finally she died, but was reborn again, once more a woman, this time of noble birth. In her third life, she would marry the Pharaoh. With her wisdom and memories intact, she deduced that she had the power of perpetual reincarnation due to having absorbed some of the Ka Stone's energies when she tended the Sphinx. Seeking to increase her link with the stone to reunite herself with her loved one, she arranged for her body to be entombed with the Scepter of Ka, an artifact from the temple which would attune her with the energies of the stone still worn by the Sphinx.[3]\nOver the centuries, she plotted, living scores of lives and accumulating many fortunes. Finally, in the latter half of the twentieth century, she was reborn in the body ofMeryet Karim, another Egyptian woman, just as the Sphinx showed himself again. She made plans for their reunion, but before she could meet the Sphinx once more, her dreams were shattered. Her loved one, tiring of immortality, had come into conflict with Nova, then with Galactus himself, and been destroyed.[3][1]\nSearching for her old tomb\nBut she was not defeated. Using her personal fortune, she built up a sizable organization of devoted followers. She and her underlings then journeyed to her eons-old tomb in the Temple of Ka. Wielding both modern technology and the ancient power of the Ka Scepter, she used its jewel to gather the Ka-stone energies that had been scattered through the Earth's atmosphere with the defeat of the Sphinx.[4]She succeeded in imbuing herself with the power of the Sphinx, but in her eagerness, she was overwhelmed by the mighty energies coursing through her body. Without conscious thought she used these energies to twist reality itself, altering the world's history to the way she wished it had always been, creating a cosmic lie.[3]\nIn thisnew reality, theSphinxhad not lefther counterpartthose millennia ago in Egypt. Instead, he had returned her love and they had lived happily together for millennia as immortals, making sure that Egyptian culture dominated the world until the twentieth century. Egypt even colonized America, which became known as the United States of Assyria. In this false reality, the Sphinx eventually tired of life, passing on his great powers to his consort, but leaving a mystic cat infused with his love as a keepsake for her.[5]\nHowever, reality was not so easily changed. Two beings existed who were connected with the Ka Stone:Sayge, a mystical embodiment of Truth who had been companion and nemesis of the original Sphinx, andRichard Ryder, the man called Nova. They could subconsciously sense the basic \"wrongness\" of the altered timeline. With the help of a mutant rebellion who opposed the Egyptian hegemony, Nova and Sayge were able to pierce the self-deception of Sphinx II. Unable to maintain the truth of her own created reality when confronted with it, Sphinx II's own self-deception was shattered, and this returned the Earth to normal.[6]\nThe second Sphinx survived her defeat, but was bitter and heartbroken at the loss of her perfect world.[7]What she didn't know was that her reassembling of the Ka stone led to Anath Na Mut also being reincarnated into a new body.[8][9]\nMerging with Anath-Na Mut\nUpon find there was someone wielding his power, Anath-Na Mut invited Meryet to meet him. Clouded by her feelings, Meryet walked into Anath's trap and he drained half of her powers. He promptly exiled the New Warriors throughout time and returned to Egypt, where he was confronted by Karim again. She tried to find good in him once more, but he tricked her and absorbed the remainder of her power. After this, she returned to New York, where she met with a new team of New Warriors to help them defeat the Sphinx and bring their teammates back. After the old New Warriors returned, theSaygeappeared and showed the Sphinx the hopelessness of his life. Finally making the right decision, he accepted Karim's love and the two merged into a more peaceful composite Sphinx.[10]\nThis new composite Sphinx later killed a clone who was thought to be Speedball to save the timeline.[11]\nThe Sphinx's powers stem from her exposure to the mystic energies of theKa Stone.\nLater, merging herself with the original Sphinx's energies from the Ka Scepter, she gained nearly omnipotent power:"

Their existence was highly unnatural, as Wanda's pregnancy progressed from early signs to full birth in less than a full day. Originally Wanda and Vision expected one kid and argued over his name. Wanda wanted to name their kid Tommy, because \"it is a nice, classic, all-American name\", but Vision wanted to name him Billy, afterWilliam Shakespeare. They argued during the entire pregnancy, but when the child was born Vision gave in and named him Tommy. Ironically, they had twins, so when the second child was born Wanda named him Billy.[8]\nOriginal body\nThe twins were toddlers for only few days, and then aged themselves directly to 5-year-old kids, with appropriate intelligence, speech and personalities. They found a dog crying alone outside of their house, so they brought it in and wanted to make it their pet, but Wanda and Vision disagreed, telling them what taking care of a living being is a big responsibility and they can't have a pet until they are at least 10 years old. Hearing this, the twins gleefully aged themselves again into 10-year olds and named the dogSparky. Unfortunately, the dog hadn't lived for long and died later that day. The twins were heartbroken by Sparky's death and wanted to age themselves again to avoid the grief and pain, but Wanda convinced them to stop, because it was a wrong solution to deal with their emotions. Tommy then begged Wanda to resurrect Sparky, because she \"can fix everything\". Wanda was shocked and tried to convince them what there are some things that couldn't be changed and the death is forever, but Billy argued back that earlier she said that \"family is forever\" and Sparky is their family, so she should bring it back. To Wanda's further shock later that day her deceased brotherPietroseemingly returned to life and came to her house.[9]\nBilly using his powers against the S.W.O.R.D.\nNext day the twins went to celebrate the Halloween with their mother and uncle. \"Pietro\" used his superhuman speed to gather all the candies and soon Tommy displayed the same power. In meanwhile, Vision, who started to suspect that something was wrong in Westview, went outside the town. He accidently crossed the border of the Hex anomaly and his body started to dissolve. Billy telepathically felt his father's pain and heard the thoughts of theS.W.O.R.D.'s agents who believed that Vision was dying. Billy run back to Wanda and she expanded the borders of the Hex to save Vision.[10]This greatly overexerted Wanda's powers and caused them to glitch the next day, so she asked the neighbor \"Agnes\" to take care of the twins for a while. The twins went to Agnes' house, and soon Billy noticed what he can't hear her thoughts. Agnes then revealed her true identity as an ancient witch Agatha Harkness and captured the twins to use them as hostages to force Wanda to reveal how exactly she managed to cast such a powerful magic that created the Hex.[11][12]\nDuring the confrontation with Agatha, Wanda finally realized how much her actions harmed the citizens of the Westview and decided to disperse the Hex, but then discovered that bodies of Vision, Billy and Tommy also started to vanish, because their existence was tied to the Hex and they couldn't exist without it. Wanda nevertheless decided to disperse the Hex. She and Vision went back to their home with the kids, where after tucking them in bed she tearfully said goodnight to Billy and Tommy shortly before the Hex receded entirely and Billy and Tommy's bodies disappeared with it.[7]\nBilly inWilliam Kaplan's body\nUnknowingly to Wanda, Billy soul actually survived by entering the body of 13-year-oldWilliam Kaplanwho had just died in the car crash near Westview the same moment the Hex was dissolved. Accidently, earlier that dayanother witchsecretly placed asigilon William Kaplan that protected him from all witches, so Billy's existence wasn't discovered by Wanda.[2]\nBilly woke up in aEastviewhospital without his own or William Kaplan's memories. The only thing he remembered was the name \"Tommy\", but he didn't know whose name it was. He soon discovered that he can hear William's parents thoughts who were extremely worried about him and hoped what he could regain his memories and become their son again while also fearing what he would never be himself again. To appease them Billy decided to embrace identity of William Kaplan and pretended to recover from his \"amnesia\".[2]\nAs he grew up, he studied witches and witchcraft to figure out who he was and what happened at Westview. In the process he learned about the sigil on his body and its effect and also assembled a spellbook with a variety of useful spells.[2]\nThree years later Billy entered a romantic relationship with a boy namedEddie,[4]and eventually decided to tell him what he actually hadn't regained his memories and believed that he wasn't actually Billy Kaplan.[2]\nTo learn the truth about the Westview, Billy managed to contactRalph Bohnerwho had been in the past controlled and enchanted byAgatha Harknessto act as Pietro. Billy learned from him about Wanda and Vision having twins Tommy and Billy, speedster and mind reader. Realizing that he was actually Billy Maximoff, he also learned that Agatha was still living in the Westview under Wanda's spell. After further research, Billy also learned of theWitches' Road, which he could use to find Tommy.[2]\nGathering theCoven\nBilly broke into Agatha Harkness' house and was able to use one of the spells he had learned to break Wanda's spell on Agatha. Shortly after she was attacked byRio Vidalwho tried to kill her, but Agatha managed to convince her to stop and wait until she got magic back. Rio agreed, but revealed what she already told theSalem Sevenwhere they can find Agatha. Learning this, Harkness wanted to quickly run away, but Billy convinced her to help him enter the Witches' Road lying that he wanted to do it for power. He used the threat of Salem Seven's upcoming attack to force Agatha to agree, since she desperately needed to regain her powers in order to survive their attack.[13][2]\nAgatha was curious how he managed to break the spell cast by the Scarlet Witch, and asked who he was, but discovered that he have a sigil placed on him that protected his identity from being discovered by any witch. Not being able to learn his true identity, Agatha started to call him just \"Teen\", while also sometimes mockingly calling him her \"pet\" or \"familiar\". They then gathered Divination WitchLilia Calderu, Potion WitchJennifer Kale, Protection WitchAlice Wu-Gulliverand \"Green Witch\"Sharon Davis(who actually wasn't a witch and was brought in by Agatha instead of an actual Green Witch whom she had believed was Rio Vidal) to assemble acovento enter the Witches' Road.[4]\nFirst Trial\nDuring their first trial, the members of the coven had to drink poisoned wine and then create a potion to cure from it or die from the poisoning or drowning. As Billy was an underage, other witches forbid him from drinking the wine. Agatha actually also hadn't drank it, which prevented the trial from proceeding. Other witches tried to convince her to drink and Billy eventually forced her to do it by attempting to drink the poison himself. His unpoisoned blood eventually turned out to be an ingredient of the potion and with it the witches managed to cure themselves and finish the trial. Unfortunately, Sharon Davis died after the trial, presumably because she drank more poison than others.[14]\nSecond Trial\nBack on the Road, Billy dug a grave and buried Sharon Davis. The witches then discovered that he had a sigil placed on him, and Billy pretended that he wasn't aware about its effect. They then used the spell from Billy's spellbook to summon a new Green Witch directly to the Witches' Road, who turned out to be Rio Vidal. Agatha was infuriated, but had no choice but continue with the trials. Their second trial was to defeat Alice Wu-Gulliver'sfamily curse. Billy was seriously injured during the battle with it, but managed to hold on until the coven killed the Curse, before collapsing from the blood lose. Returning to the Road, Jennifer Kale managed to heal him with a potion.[15]\nThird Trial\nUnknowingly to the Coven, when they summoned Rio Vidal to the Road, they left the door open. The Salem Seven managed to use it to follow them to the Road in order to kill Agatha. To escape from them, Billy suggested to use the brooms and others reluctantly agreed. The Coven managed to reach the third trial, during which they summoned the ghost who turned out to be Agatha's motherEvanora Harkness. To finish the trial, they had to punish Agatha by abandoning her. Other witches of the Coven agreed and only Billy opposed this decision. Evanora possessed Agatha to stop her from leaving, Alice Wu-Gulliver tried to help and used magic on Agatha to banish Evanora's ghost. Inadvertently it activated Agatha's power and she absorbed all of Alice's magic and seemingly killed her. Billy was horrified and accused Agatha of using everyone to regain her powers, not caring for their lives at all. Billy claimed that he doesn't want to be a witch if it means that he would use others to achieve his goals. Agatha gloated over his claims, saying that he wasn't any different and was just like his mother. Billy was shocked that she somehow realized that he was Scarlet Witch's son even with the sigil on him. In a panic, he mind controlled Lilia and Jennifer to grab and throw Agatha into the swamp, and then telekinetically pushed them into it as well.[3]\nSince his identity was no longer a secret, Billy destroyed the sigil. Agatha managed to crawl out of the swamp and congratulated him for surviving the Hex against her original expectations and told him to not blame himself for using William Kaplan's body, as he did it to survive just like witches for centuries were doing everything they can to survive. Billy decided that he no longer needed Agatha and would finish the Road on his own, but she ridiculed him, because he can't control his powers and couldn't manifest them at all without experiencing extremely strong emotions. Billy reluctantly agreed and they proceeded to look for the fourth trial.[2]\nFourth Trial\nOn the way Agatha asked if he have any questions for \"his mother's ex-best friend\", but Billy retorted that Wanda wasn't his mother, he already had amother. But then asked if Wanda was really dead, but Agatha wasn't sure herself. The fourth trial was to read a person's fate with Tarot, with swords falling from the ceiling all around them for every wrong reading. Billy and Agatha attempted to read the Tarot for each other with no success and the ceiling started to slowly go down. After one of the swords almost impaled Billy,Lilia CalderuandJennifer Kalesuddenly entered the trial as well. Billy apologized for pushing them away from the Road and explained what he hadn't knew about his powers and if he knew he would have saved Alice. Lilia then attempted to read Billy's fate with Tarot, but the swords continued to fall, indicating that the reading was still wrong. Eventually Lilia realized that she was the one whose fate she should read and managed to finish the reading before the ceiling completely descended. Lilia sent the rest of the coven out of the trial, but she herself stayed behind and used the Road's rules to kill theSalem Seven.[5]\nBilly and Jen were disheartened by Lilia's death, but Agatha forced them to continue to walk the Road as they had the last trial to finish. The trial was for a green witch and required them to grow something in the empty room with no soil, seeds or water. Agatha pinpointed that potions are related to earth magic, so Jen should be able to do it, but Jen argued back what her powers are bound and she can't do it. During the quarrel Agatha suddenly realized that she was the one who bound Jen's powers almost a century ago, but she hadn't knew it was Jen. Jen then performed the unbinding ritual to free herself and regain her powers. As she got that she wanted from the Witches' Road, Jen was immediately expulsed from the Road. Neither Billy no Agatha have powers needed to complete the Trial, so Agatha instead decided to help Billy to get what he wanted. Under her guidance he managed to findTommy's soul and transferred it into the body of a boy who was just drowned to death. With his wish fulfilled, Billy was also expulsed from the Road.[16]\nAgatha managed to finish the last trial on her own and exited the Road, but she hadn't regained her powers. She was attacked by Rio Vidal who actually was Death. To thank Agatha for her help, Billy interfered in the fight and telekinetically pushed Death away. He then attacked Agatha to let her absorb his magic and repower herself, but asked her to not take everything. Agatha absorbed a lot, but eventually pushed Billy away to broke their connection. Unfortunately, even repowered she was still no match for Death. Death offered them a deal — one of them would die and she would let the other one leave. Agatha agreed, but it was actually just a trick to force Billy to agree as she had previously made another deal with Death — Agatha would convince Billy to willingly die, and in exchange Death would never come to Agatha again and when Agatha would eventually die, Death wouldn't take her away. Billy indeed agreed, but before Death could take him, Agatha absorbed some of Death's power and immediately died from it. In result she managed to fulfill conditions of both deals — she convinced Billy to give up, so Death now wouldn't take Agatha away after her death, but Agatha also died, so Death was unable to take Billy as well. Death kept her word and allowed Billy to leave.[16]\nBilly returned back to the house of the Kaplans, but when he entered his room he suddenly noticedLorna Wu and the Coral Shores's poster on the wall, Ouija board, toys of various witches, like the Wicked Witch of the West, models of color trees, and a variety of other items that were parts of the trials on the Witches' Road. He had also recalled Agatha's words about the Road being just a legend and about him being exactly like Wanda and having the same tell. Billy finally realized that the Witches' Road actually never existed; just like Scarlet Witch subconsciously created the Hex anomaly out of her grief and desire to have a family, Billy subconsciously created the Road out of his strong desire to find Tommy and learn truth about himself.[16][17]\nDestruction of theWitches' Road\nAgatha reappeared as a ghost and confirmed that the Road was indeed just a hoax. Billy freaked out and blamed himself for the deaths of Sharon, Alice and Lilia, believing that they were killed by his subconsciousness. Agatha retorted that she originally planned to kill entire coven she and Billy gathered, just like she killed countless desperate witches over the centuries by using the legend about the Witches' Road to lure them. So by creating the Road Billy actually managed to save one of the witches — Jen survived and even regained her powers.[17]\nProtected by theSigil\nBilly's statue in the Temple of the Darkhold"

Together they manipulated events behind the scenes on a global scale, with the sole goal of political and monetary control over the destiny ofEarth.[5][6]\nBurke was burned at the stake in the 17th century, guillotined in the 18th century, and at some point in the 19th century, he was hanged.[1]\nIn 1891,Candradecided that she would stopEn Sabah Nur's glacier-like crawl to power and took the ability to fold space through her magic, where he used science. For unknown reasons the High Lords did not wish to physically act against her, so once they learned of her plans, Burke and the others hadDr. Nathan Milbury, who worked for En Sabah Nur, deal with Candra instead.[7]\nOnce Candra made it to En Sabah Nur's sanctum beneath the pyramids outside ofBani MazainEgypt, thanks to herThieves Guildand their leaderJean-Luc LeBeau, she began to translate the text. But a time-travelingGambit,Courier, and Dr. Nathan Milbury stopped her via Milbury's transport ship. When Candra chose to steal the power to fold space another day, she tried to bring down the sanctum, but as the others ran, Milbury quickly overpowered her with his new found metamorphic ability. Defeated she begged him to stop and he revealed Burke and the other four High Lords were the reason for her loss. Candra tried to explain her actions, but Burke and the others knew En Sabah Nor's citadel was not to be touched, his slow rise to power was not to be interrupted. For their greater glory awaited at the Millennial Dawn,[8][9][10]and Candra's actions put that at risk, thus they punished her.[11]\nIn more recent years, the High Lords were searching for the next External to ascend and their next member. For a time, thanks toGideonbelieved it wasRoberto da Costa,[12]but whenCannonballcame back to life moments after his death, it was sensed by Burke and the other four High Lords, who then believed that Samuel was the next External they had been looking for.[13]\nBurke and the others gathered at fellow External and High LordNicodemus' chalet in theSwiss Alps, to discuss this new revelation. ThoughAbsalom, who already disliked Gideon, was made more so by the months he wasted on recruiting the wrong person,Sauland Nicodemus listened to Gideon’s plan to get Samuel to join them. They were shocked to learn that he planned to useCrule, but Burke was more concerned that Gideon’s plan would only serve to leadCable, who was already aware of Gideon being an External, right to them. They further feared that this might also draw the attention ofXavier, hisX-Men,X-Factor, orX-Forceto learn of their existence.[14][5]\nBurke's concerns were correct in that Krule's failure exposed them,[15]but more than that, when Saul helped Gideon kidnap three of Samuel's teammates, they where further revealed. X-Force found the hospitalized Krule, who was more than happy to give up his fellow High Lords.[16]\nBurke was later infected by theLegacy Virus. Before his death, he used his precognitive abilities to inform his fellow Externals of the future, including of Sam Guthrie, whom he believed to be an External as well, being the\"architect of [their] salvation.\"[2]\nLike the other Externals, Burke returned to life yet again; however he became tired of living. Not having an interest in joining Selene and other Externals, he instead went to live in a chalet inTonasket,Washington.\nThere, due to his precognitive powers, he knew that Cable andArmorwere coming to inquire about the murderer of Candra.[1]Burke foresaw who is the killer, but refused to tell them as he hoped to be killed as well. As Cable's team left the premises,said assailantappeared and murdered Burke. Burke thanked him as he died;[1]however, his respite was short lived, and he was soon reborn yet again to a couple inMaple Ridge,Canada.[4]\nFollowing theMutant Massacreat theHellfire Galaat the hands ofOrchis, the mutant population ofEarthwas scattered. And with Krakoa nearly abandoned, Selene, working withSebastian ShawandOrchis, took the External Gate that still contend three of the four Externals still trapped within.[17][18]Selene having Burke, Absalom and Gideon join her, she made them and the now free and newly resurrected Nicodemus, Saul and Crule gather mutants (and depowered mutants) from across the globe and bring them back to her base inNova Romafor her ascension to become a True High Lord.[19]\nUsing his psychic ability, Burke saw that there were mutants inCamp GozhooinArizona. He was then sent there with Crule, and a number of Selene's undead Orchis soldiers. As Crule kept the brothersThunderbirdandWarpathbusy, and the undead Orchis stoppedMirage. Burke was able to slip in and takeSomnus,Cerebraand all the mutants there unseen say forGrandma Lozenwho quickly told the others.[20]\nAfter, Burke joined the other Externals at Selene's base in Nova Roma. He listened as the others discussed the situation of Selene's ritual and mutants needed for it.[21]\nLater, Burke joined Gideon at hisChicago (Illinois)in West Town penthouse. It's there Burke suddenly got a vision of metal, blades gleaming in the light, a gilded sneer and so much blood. Just thenSolemappeared, cutting through Gideon's double doors. As Burke watched the two fight, seemingly unaware that Solem was hired to deal with Gideon while several floors down Sunspot,Shatterstar,Trinary, andWiz-Kidwho was back atX-Corps Islandattempted to shut down Gideon's mutant tracking software. As the fight continued, Solem tells Gideon that inviting a seer was a mistake and despite fighting two at a time would be fun, all Burke gets is scraps and threw a knife into his chest. But having missed his heart, Burke was unfazed, and told Solem that if he wants to kill him he will have to do more than talk it. With Burke's gift of foresight to useful to lose, Gideon get in between him and Solem. But Solem, jumping over Gideon, plunged his sword into Burke's back and split his spine. As Gideon told Burke to suffer on, because they only needed his head. Solem, as he pulled the blade out of Burke's back, he named him Burke of the Deathwish Unfed.[22]\nBurke is anExternalMutantthat has so far shown the following powers:\nImmortal:He is effectively immortal and since Burke's immortality became active after his first death, he no longer ages. Though he can be put out of commission or destroyed for various periods of time, Burke cannot be permanently killed.[5][1][4]\nPsychic-Link:Burke shares a telepathic-link with other Externals that allows them to not only sense each other whereabouts, but also call on each other at will from great distances. He is also able to sense when a new External rises from their first death and when one is killed by another External.[5][6][24][25][26][27]"

The boy claimed his real name was \"Buckalaag\". The heroHerculeshad trouble pronouncing his name and initially called him \"Bucka\". The hero then decided to call him \"Bucky\".\nBuckalaag was a slave, forced to labor in the construction of a pyramids. He saw in a dream that Hercules will come to his rescue.  One day, Bucka was being whipped by the evil slave-driver Phao Na Tash (the apparent previous incarnation of Emil Natas). The boy claimed that Hercules (the supposed previous incarnation ofCaptain America) would come to his rescue. Na Tash had heard of the hero in question, but was certain that he would never dare to come to this place of torment. He was wrong about this. Hercules turned up a moment later and challenged the \"foul fiend\" to a duel.\nThe boy was glad to get help. He introduced himself and promised to be Hercules' \"friend for life\". Hercules took Bucka on as his sidekick. The hero set the rest of the slaves free. Na Tash led a small army in attacking the hero with deadly weapons. Hercules was only armed with a shield, but started taking out the villains with his own attacks. An encouraged Bucka used his own bare fists to take down foes. With all his men down for the count, Na Tash run away from the battle.\nNa Tash took refuge in his own, unfinished pyramid. Hercules and Bucka tracked him there and were eager to finish him. Na Tash decided to set a trap for them. He moved an unbalanced stone of the pyramid in an attempt to crush his pursuers underneath it. The attack failed and had an unwelcome effect. It caused another unbalanced stone to fall on Na Tash, mortally wounding him.\nThe dying man had a last surprise for the two heroes.

To defeat the demon, the Scarlet Witch's mentorAgatha Harknesserased her memories about the twins.[9]Agatha's decision, while initially done to save Wanda from the pain of losing her children, eventually turned out to be a great disaster to the world. Wanda was kept in dark about their existence for many years, but when she learned the truth she killed Agatha, and unleashed her grief and anger on her friends and teammates theAvengers, killing several of them, including Vision and in result the teamdisassembled.[14]To reunite with her children Wanda then transformed entire world into theHouse of Mand when she was forced to accept reality and lose the twins again, her sanity completely snapped and the Scarlet Witch cast one last spell, \"No More Mutants\" thatdepoweredalmost all mutants on the planet and fundamentally changed the world for years to come.[15][16]\nUnknown to everyone, whenAgatha Harkness's spell defeatedMephistoand temporarily destroyed his body, Billy and Tommy were freed. They became the lost souls, forgotten and undetectable to almost everyone. They were on the run from Mephisto ever since, escaping from him across the time and space for years while he relentlessly chased his \"wayward offsprings\" wanting to devour them to restore his full power.[17][6]Under unknown circumstances, Billy and Tommy were eventually reincarnated asBilly KaplanandTommy Shepherd, better known as super heroesWiccanandSpeed.[8]\nAt some pointTime-Keepers, mysterious beings that monitored and protected the timelines and realities, became concerned with how powerful theScarlet Witch, theNexus Beingof herreality, was becoming. Especially because they have seen one of the potential futures where Wanda'stwochildrenbecame so powerful what they were able to confront and fight with theEternitytheAbstractrepresenting entire reality. Alarmed by this possibility and the threat these children would pose, the Time-Keepers ordered their servantImmortusto kill the Scarlet Witch. Immortus, however, liked to act in a more subtle ways. To prevent the birth of Wanda's children he manipulated the events and slowly nudgedVisionto confess his love to Wanda and then propose the marriage to which she agreed. Immortus believed that Vision's artificial body would prevent them from having kids. He even officiated the wedding ceremony.[12]\nUnfortunately for Immortus, his plan hadn't worked for long. While Wanda wanted a full family and wanted to suggest having children with Vision on multiple occasions, she never did, because of his artificial body.[18]However, after Vision reunited with his \"twin brother\"Wonder Manand \"their\" motherMartha Williams, he became interested in having a baby as well.[19]He believed that with the Scarlet Witch's hex powers to alter possibilities, she would be able to turn impossible into possible and they would be able to have a baby, but Wanda argued back that even with her incredible powers she wasn't able to create a life.[18]\nThey were soon captured by theSalem's Sevenwho planned to sacrifice them during the magical ritual. Wanda and Vision defeated the Seven, but in result magical energy went berserk. To stop it, Wanda channeled it into her own body. She then saw the spirit of her former teacherAgatha Harkness, who was killed by the Seven. Agatha told her to use the energy, so Wanda made a wish to have a child with Vision.[18]Unknowingly to even her, Wanda used all this energy to subconsciously cast a spell that captured the two fragments of the demonMephisto's essence (whose body was not long ago destroyed byFranklin Richards[20]and shattered into six fragments) and they were used as souls for the children.[9]\nA month laterDoctor Strangeconfirmed that Wanda was now indeed pregnant, which even he, the strongest sorcerer on the planet, considered to be a miracle. Wanda told about the pregnancy to Vision, much to his happiness.[4]They kept the news in secret for a month, before Wanda told about it to her brotherPietro Maximoff.[21]\nOn Hallows Eve Wanda performed a ritual to summonAgatha Harkness' spirit, but the ritual was hijacked by the deadSalem's Seven, who wanted revenge andSamhain, who wanted to possess Wanda's unborn baby to have a physical body. With Vision's help Agatha managed to instead split Samhain's energy and merge it into corpses of the Salem Seven, locking him in the afterlife forever.[21]\nDoctor Strange served as Wanda's physician during the entire pregnancy.[22]She and Vision wanted to be surprised, so they asked Strange to not tell them the baby's gender.[3]The fetus first moved on January 15 (Martin Luther King's birthday).[23]In April Doctor Stange told Wanda that the baby is bigger than normal, and it could cause premature birth, so she better stop doing superheroics. Wanda wondered if she is having twins, but Strange said she is not.[24]\nAs they expected only one child of unknown gender, Wanda and Vision considered multiple male and female names. At 7 months they considered \"Phineas\" (afterPhineas Horton, who built Vision's original body) and \"Sanford\" (after Vision's \"father\"Sanford Williams) for boy, and \"Martha\" (after Vision's \"mother\"Martha Williams), \"Magda\" (afterMagda Eisenhardtwhom at the time Wanda believed was her biological mother) and \"Agatha\" (after Wanda's mentor Agatha Harkness) for girl. Since Vision hadn't had a last name, Wanda decided to abandon her last name as well, and they planned for the child to not have a last name, so they also considered names \"Alexander\" for a boy and \"Lauren\" for a girl, because these names \"stand out on its own\".[3]Shortly before birth, they changed mind and stopped their choice on \"Thomas\", the middle name of Phineas Horton, because, while Vision was grateful to Horton, he considered the name \"Phineas\" to be outdated, and \"Diana\" afterDiana, goddess of witchcraft.[1]\nShortly before birth, Wanda mentally connected with the child and, like Doctor Strange, felt what she would have only one son.[1]Wanda expected to give birth the second week of May,[3]but the birth started six days earlier.[1]\nDoctor Strange personally delivered the child,Thomas, but much to his shock then suddenly discovered a second child. Even after the boy was born they were unable to register his existence with any instruments or magic. Wanda and Vision named their second sonWilliam, because, despite not having a last name, Vision wanted to carry theWilliamsname forward somehow. Three days after birth the family returned home from hospital.[1]\nThe family lived happily for several months, and every once in a whileWonder Manvisited them to read fables to the twins.[25]\nSome time after their birth, the twins were visited byJohn KowalskiandDeath, because they were curious about the children's nature. Kowalski felt the void in one of the boys, that reminded him about himself. When Wanda confronted them, Death assured her that the twins are in no danger, because their time has not come yet.[13]On another occasion,Mother Righteous, who extensively studied various forms of magic, visited Billy and Tommy in their nursery, presumably fascinated by their nature as well.[11]\nWhen theAvengers, former teammates of Vision and the Scarlet Witch, were arrested by the US government on false charges. They were told that one of the former Avengers betrayed them. After escaping, Avengers discussed and narrowed down the list of suspects to several candidates, including the Scarlet Witch and Vision. Wonder Man came to their house to ask, and they confirmed it wasn't them who betrayed the team. Eventually the team learned it was actually Wanda's brotherPietro Maximoff. Pietro felt betrayed by the Avengers and theInhuman Royal Family, and planned to destroy bothEarthandMoonin revenge. Wanda wanted to personally go to stop him, but Vision asked her to stay with the twins. She created a crystal with holographic images of the twins and Vision brought it with him. Vision managed to stop Pietro by showing him the image and asking if he really hates everyone on both worlds, including his innocent nephews.[26]\nThe Scarlet Witch and Vision soon joined theAvengers West Coast.[27]While they were on missions they left the twins with their grandmotherMartha Williams, until they eventually decided to relocate toAvengers Compoundin theLos Angeles.[10]\nWhen the twins were born,Immortuswas shocked and alarmed. He investigated and discovered that their souls were parts ofMephistoand that Mephisto already sendMaster Pandemoniumafter them. However, the bond between the Scarlet Witch and the twins was too strong. Immortus feared that even Mephisto wouldn't be able to defeat her and destroy the children, so he decided to arrange the events to weaken the Scarlet Witch.[12]\nAs Vision previously took control over all computer systems of the world, Immortus influenced governments and intelligence organizations to form theVigilance, to stop him from revealing their top secrets.[12]Vigilance kidnapped Vision from the Avengers Compound and also infected Avengers' systems with computer virus that erased all records about Vision.[28]Wanda and the Avengers tracked down kidnappers and went after them, while Billy and Tommy were left in the Compound with their governessHelen Bach.[29]When Bach was giving the twins the morning bath, she looked away for a second and when she looked back they were gone. She looked around entire house, but couldn't find them, so she activated the alarm.[30]\nMeanwhile the Avengers infiltrated the Vigilance's facility and discovered Vision. Unfortunately, they were too late, the Vigilance already dismantled his body and completely erased his mind. Moreover, the virus that erased records about Vision also erased data back-ups of his mind, so while the Avengers could rebuild his body, they couldn't restore his mind and memories. Wanda was horrified as it meant that the man she loved was now effectively dead. Additional blow was delivered by the appearance of Phineas Horton, creator of the originalHuman Torch. Vision previously told the Avengers that Horton died on his hands and they also believed that the Human Torch's body was used byUltronto create Vision. However, now Horton claimed that Vision's body had nothing to do with the Human Torch and he had no idea who built Vision.[30]In truth, this Horton was actually aSpace Phantomsent by Immortus to destabilize the situation and further confuse the Scarlet Witch.[12]\nWhen Wanda and the Avengers returned to the Compound with Vision's remains, they discovered a distress signal from Miss Bach. Wanda raced to the house where Bach informed her that the twins disappeared from the bathroom. However, when they entered the bathroom Billy and Tommy were there, playing in the water. Miss Bach was shocked, while Wanda was infuriated and fired Bach.[30]Wanda soon hired a new governess,Mrs. Hunter, during the interview Wanda was called byHank Pyminto the lab, while Mrs. Hunter went to the nursery where Billy and Tommy should have been sleeping according to Wanda, but she wasn't able to find the twins.[31]Mrs. Hunter was subsequently also fired. Wanda hired and fired multiple governess after her, the last of whom wasLauren Timm. The same incident with the twins happened several times, but as Lauren needed the job, she hadn't told Wanda about them.[32][33]\nHank Pym rebuilt Vision's body and even managed to reprogram his mind, uploading all the information about his time with the Avengers into him, but while he had all the information, he hadn't had an emotional connection to it.[31]Because of it Vision no longer felt fatherly love for Billy and Tommy and told them that he is no longer their father.[34]\nAfter Billy and Tommy disappeared yet again,Agatha Harknesscame to their house.[33]Wanda was shocked, because Agatha was supposed to be dead. Agatha handwaved it, claiming that for a powerful witch like her resurrection is not a big problem, the more pressing point was the origin of the twins. Wanda claimed that they were just normal children, but Agatha disagreed and pinpointed that Wanda knows it as well. The reason for Billy and Tommy's disappearances was that when Wanda was not thinking about them, they ceased to exist. Due to the various events, secretly orchestrated byImmortusin recent months, Wanda was traumatized so many times that her magical connection with the twins significantly weakened. As her mind was in a constant state of confusion and distress, any moment she was distracted, Billy and Tommy disappeared. Wanda refused to admit or accept it.[35]\nMeanwhile,Master Pandemoniumsummoned countless demons to attack the Avengers Compound and while they were fighting with the Avengers, he went after the twins. Master Pandemonium fought against Vision, the Scarlet Witch and Agatha Harkness, but in truth he was just distracting them, while another of his demon sneaked behind their backs and kidnapped Billy and Tommy. Pandemonium and demons retreated, returning to their dimension, where Pandemonium merged Billy and Tommy into his arms.[35]Originally, he just wanted to use them as a replacement for two of five missing parts of his soul, but when he merged with the twins he realized that they were actually indeed fragments of his soul, further enriched bymutantenergy they drew from their mother they increased Pandemonium's power a thousandfold.[9]\nAgatha Harkness cast the spell to track down Master Pandemonium and teleported the Avengers into his dimension to rescue Billy and Tommy. They were horrified to see the twins merged with Pandemonium, and he easily defeated entire team and planned to absorb Wanda's soul as well, to fill another gap in his soul with her power. Hank Pym pinpointed that the twins were born before Master Pandemonium lost his soul due to the deal withMephisto, so they couldn't be its parts. Mephisto then appeared and confirmed that he had indeed lied to Pandemonium in the past and the five fragments he was looking after weren't parts of Pandemonium's soul, but instead parts of Mephisto himself. He merges with Billy and Tommy, but is suddenly attacked byEbony, Agatha Harkness' familiar whom she sent to protect the Avengers. While Mephisto is distracted, Agatha telepathically contacted Wanda and convinced her to open her mind and soul to her. Wanda does and she and Mephisto then cry in pain. Mephisto disappears, while the Avengers are suddenly returned back to the Avengers Compound and Wanda is unconscious.[9]\nAgatha Harkness then revealed the true origin of Billy and Tommy to the Avengers. They were created by a combination of Wanda's magic and probability manipulation powers, with Mephisto's fragments serving as their souls. In a sense Billy and Tommy were manifestations of Wanda's will, illusions so strong that evenDoctor Strange, theSorcerer Supreme, hadn't noticed anything wrong with them and believed in their existence. Agatha erased Wanda's memories about the twins, and as they were still bound by Wanda's spell when Mephisto absorbed them, it in result affected him as well and dispersed his body again. The Avengers were shocked by Agatha's actions, considering it to be extremely cruel towards Wanda, but Agatha pinpointed that the twins were already gone; she erased memories about them just to spare Wanda of the pain of losing children.[9]\nProtected byAmerica Chavez\nUnknowingly to Agatha or anyone else, when Mephisto's body was dispersed, Billy and Tommy were freed from him. Unfortunately, as they were forgotten by Wanda, they became just lost souls whom no one was able to see, except for few rare individuals. At some point they found a shard of theM'kraan Crystalthat \"was lost too\". The shard allowed them to travel in space and time, so they used it to run away from \"Mister Fisto\" who was chasing after them.[17]\nOne of the portals lead them into the future, around a decade after their \"death.\" They metAmerica Chavezwho fought Mephisto and then run away with the twins. Tommy reminisced about their lives, about thehomethey had and their mom and dad and how Vision taught Tommy to walk, but Billy hadn't had these memories. To console and cheer them up America told them about theUtopian Parallel. Mephisto found them again and promised to restore America Chavez' powers, if she give his \"wayward offsprings\" to him, but she refused. She used the Crystal to open the portal and pushed Mephisto into it. The twins then also used the Crystal to open another portal and continued to escape from the Hell Lord.[17]\nNo matter how many times they escaped and hid, Mephisto continued to chase after them. Some time later, the twins appeared in theMidnight Chapel. It was observed and possibly orchestrated byYoung ImmortusandM'Kraan,[5]who called them \"demiurgic stowaways\". To protect the kids from Mephisto, her grandfather, M'Kraan cast a spell on him. Unable to take them himself, Mephisto sent his son demonBlackheartafter Billy and Tommy.[6]\nVia the Chapel the twins entered theAvengers Academy Campus. There they were first seen byWalpurgis, the magical purple cat who was the son ofAgatha Harkness's familiar'sEbonyand then also by Walpurgis' ownerBrielle Brooks.[6]They were happy to play with Walpurgis, but spooked when Brielle saw them so they run away. They separated and decided to rendezvous back in theMidnight Chapel. Blackheart entered the Campus and almost captured Billy, but he was saved by Brielle. Tommy meanwhile went to the infirmary and helpedShela Sextonto heal and awaken and then lead her to the Chapel. All four reunited there, but were stopped by Blackheart. Shela used her powers on him and this contact shocked Blackheart and he allowed his brothers to go and be free and happy, like he never could.[7]\nUnder unknown circumstances, Billy and Tommy were later reincarnated asBilly KaplanandTommy Shepherd,[8]but they forgot everything about their original lives and each other. Kaplan and Shepherd grew up separately in different families and hadn't met each other until they were 16 years old. Ironically, both were included by Vision into theAvengers Fail-Safe Programas being related to the Avengers, without him realizing that they were his reincarnated sons.[36][37]Kaplan and Shepherd also had no idea why they were included into the Fail-Safe Program, untilSuper-Skrulltold them about Wanda and Vision's twins.[38]Doubly ironic, the Fail-Safe Program was used to assemble theYoung AvengersbyIron Lad, who was a time-traveller from the 30th century and was a younger version of Young Immortus who assisted original Billy and Tommy,[5]and also was a chronologically divergent version ofImmortuswho tried to prevent their birth.[12]\nYears after the loss of the twins, Vision regained his original memories and personality and was traumatized to learn that his children were gone and he couldn't even talk about them with Wanda and could only grieve alone.[39]The Avengers reluctantly kept the truth about Billy and Tommy's existence from Wanda for years. One day, while contemplating a pregnancy scare of her own with Wanda,Janet Van Dyneslipped up and alluded to her attempt at raising the two kids. Janet brushed off her comment, but Wanda was left unsettled. She visitedAgatha Harknessand demanded answers from her, and apparently, Agatha revealed the truth before Wanda killed her.[14]\nThe revelation greatly enraged and agitated Wanda and she desperately wanted to bring Billy and Tommy back no matter the cost. She sought the help fromDoctor Doomand together they used magic to capture the Life Force, the only power that could possibly resurrect the twins. However, they underestimated the Life Force, it possessed Wanda's body and amplified her powers into reality warping, but also affected her mind.[40]She returned to Agatha's house, and lived under the illusion in which Agatha was still alive as were Billy and Tommy. Wanda's power also affected the world around and projected her anger on the Avengers. Consciously and subconsciously she caused multiple events that lead to the death of several of her friends and teammates, including Vision, and to thedisassemblingof the Avengers. Eventually,Doctor Strangeconfronted Wanda and used theEye of Agamottoon her to force her to accept the true reality which unfortunately further affected her mind.[14]\nThe Scarlet Witch was brought away byMagneto(who then was considered to be her father) to theGenosha,[14]whereCharles Xaviertried to help her regain control over her mind and powers. Unfortunately, she was constantly recreating the scene of Billy and Tommy's birth, no matter how many times Xavier tried to help. Each time he confronted her with the truth, she was just slipping further away and each time it became harder to keep her mind in reality. Xavier eventually realized that he couldn't control Wanda for much longer, sooner or later she would completely lose herself. Xavier gathered the Avengers and theX-Mento decide Wanda's fate and they went to Genosha.[41]Before they could do anythingPietro Maximoffbrought Xavier away and convinced Wanda to combine his telepathy and her reality warping to change the world. She transformed the world into theHouse of Mwhere (thanks to Xavier's telepathy), everyone gotten that they wanted the most. Wanda herself was reunited withBillyandTommyand lived happily with them. Others eventually realized the truth about the world and confronted Magneto, while Doctor Strange once again forced Wanda to accept reality and the lose of the twins. Unfortunately, it finally snapped Wanda's sanity and she cast one last spell, \"No More Mutants\" thatdepoweredalmost all mutants on the planet and fundamentally changed the world for years to come.[15][16]"

He was apparently the past-life incarnation ofCaptain America. Natas claimed to have also lived a past life during that time, as slave driverPhao Na Tash, who worked for a Pharaoh and forced slaves to build a pyramid.\nOne day while whipping a young boy namedBucka(the supposed previous incarnation of Bucky), Na Tash heard the boy claim that Hercules would come to his rescue. Na Tash had heard of the hero in question, but was certain that he would never dare to come to this place of torment. He was wrong about this. Hercules turned up a moment later and challenged the \"foul fiend\" to a duel. Na Tash turned around to face his foe, and received a powerful blow from the bare fists of the hero.\nNa Tash was able to counter-attack with his whip. However, Hercules turned out to be invulnerable to the pain and laughed at the futile efforts of Na Tash. Hercules started releasing the slaves, while Na Tash left to gather the men under his command. Na Tash led a small army in attacking the hero with deadly weapons. Hercules was only armed with a shield, but started taking out the villains with his own attacks. An encouraged Bucka used his own bare fists to take down foes. With all his men down for the count, Na Tash run away from the battle.\nNa Tash took refuge in his own, unfinished pyramid. Hercules and Bucka tracked him there and were eager to finish him. Na Tash decided to set a trap for them. He moved an unbalanced stone of the pyramid in an attempt to crush his pursuers underneath it. The attack failed and had an unwelcome effect. It caused another unbalanced stone to fall on Na Tash, mortally wounding him.\nThe dying man had a last surprise for the two heroes. In his life, Na Tash had studied the \"hidden secrets of the soul\". He cursed Hercules, promising that Na Tash will be born again and have a rematch with the hero. And the next time, victory would be his. He then died from his wounds. The heroes did not believe him and soon left the area, planning their next mission.\nHercules then took Bucka on as his sidekick, naming him Bucky. According to Natas, Hercules and Bucka had many adventures, \"before they too met the grave\".[1]Their subsequent adventures remain unrecorded, as do the circumstances of their deaths.\nSuperhuman Strength: Hercules main \"powers\" were apparently his powerful body and the strength of his fists. He was able to take out a small army almost single-handedly. He might have had enhanced human or superhuman strength.\nSuperhuman Durability: Hercules was apparently invulnerable to the pain caused by a whip. He reacted to lashes from a whip by laughing at the efforts of the one using it. It is unclear if he could not actually fill the pain, or if his skin was hard and durable. The whip might have had no effect on him. Na Tash claimed that his opponent has \"the hide of an elephant\".[1]"

To defeat the demon, the Scarlet Witch's mentorAgatha Harknesserased her memories about the twins.[9]Agatha's decision, while initially done to save Wanda from the pain of losing her children, eventually turned out to be a great disaster to the world. Wanda was kept in dark about their existence for many years, but when she learned the truth she killed Agatha, and unleashed her grief and anger on her friends and teammates theAvengers, killing several of them, including Vision and in result the teamdisassembled.[14]To reunite with her children Wanda then transformed entire world into theHouse of Mand when she was forced to accept reality and lose the twins again, her sanity completely snapped and the Scarlet Witch cast one last spell, \"No More Mutants\" thatdepoweredalmost all mutants on the planet and fundamentally changed the world for years to come.[15][16]\nUnknown to everyone, whenAgatha Harkness's spell defeatedMephistoand temporarily destroyed his body, Billy and Tommy were freed. They became the lost souls, forgotten and undetectable to almost everyone. They were on the run from Mephisto ever since, escaping from him across the time and space for years while he relentlessly chased his \"wayward offsprings\" wanting to devour them to restore his full power.[17][6]Under unknown circumstances, Billy and Tommy were eventually reincarnated asBilly KaplanandTommy Shepherd, better known as super heroesWiccanandSpeed.[8]\nAt some pointTime-Keepers, mysterious beings that monitored and protected the timelines and realities, became concerned with how powerful theScarlet Witch, theNexus Beingof herreality, was becoming. Especially because they have seen one of the potential futures where Wanda'stwochildrenbecame so powerful what they were able to confront and fight with theEternitytheAbstractrepresenting entire reality. Alarmed by this possibility and the threat these children would pose, the Time-Keepers ordered their servantImmortusto kill the Scarlet Witch. Immortus, however, liked to act in a more subtle ways. To prevent the birth of Wanda's children he manipulated the events and slowly nudgedVisionto confess his love to Wanda and then propose the marriage to which she agreed. Immortus believed that Vision's artificial body would prevent them from having kids. He even officiated the wedding ceremony.[12]\nUnfortunately for Immortus, his plan hadn't worked for long. While Wanda wanted a full family and wanted to suggest having children with Vision on multiple occasions, she never did, because of his artificial body.[18]However, after Vision reunited with his \"twin brother\"Wonder Manand \"their\" motherMartha Williams, he became interested in having a baby as well.[19]He believed that with the Scarlet Witch's hex powers to alter possibilities, she would be able to turn impossible into possible and they would be able to have a baby, but Wanda argued back that even with her incredible powers she wasn't able to create a life.[18]\nThey were soon captured by theSalem's Sevenwho planned to sacrifice them during the magical ritual. Wanda and Vision defeated the Seven, but in result magical energy went berserk. To stop it, Wanda channeled it into her own body. She then saw the spirit of her former teacherAgatha Harkness, who was killed by the Seven. Agatha told her to use the energy, so Wanda made a wish to have a child with Vision.[18]Unknowingly to even her, Wanda used all this energy to subconsciously cast a spell that captured the two fragments of the demonMephisto's essence (whose body was not long ago destroyed byFranklin Richards[20]and shattered into six fragments) and they were used as souls for the children.[9]\nA month laterDoctor Strangeconfirmed that Wanda was now indeed pregnant, which even he, the strongest sorcerer on the planet, considered to be a miracle. Wanda told about the pregnancy to Vision, much to his happiness.[4]They kept the news in secret for a month, before Wanda told about it to her brotherPietro Maximoff.[21]\nOn Hallows Eve Wanda performed a ritual to summonAgatha Harkness' spirit, but the ritual was hijacked by the deadSalem's Seven, who wanted revenge andSamhain, who wanted to possess Wanda's unborn baby to have a physical body. With Vision's help Agatha managed to instead split Samhain's energy and merge it into corpses of the Salem Seven, locking him in the afterlife forever.[21]\nDoctor Strange served as Wanda's physician during the entire pregnancy.[22]She and Vision wanted to be surprised, so they asked Strange to not tell them the baby's gender.[3]The fetus first moved on January 15 (Martin Luther King's birthday).[23]In April Doctor Stange told Wanda that the baby is bigger than normal, and it could cause premature birth, so she better stop doing superheroics. Wanda wondered if she is having twins, but Strange said she is not.[24]\nAs they expected only one child of unknown gender, Wanda and Vision considered multiple male and female names. At 7 months they considered \"Phineas\" (afterPhineas Horton, who built Vision's original body) and \"Sanford\" (after Vision's \"father\"Sanford Williams) for boy, and \"Martha\" (after Vision's \"mother\"Martha Williams), \"Magda\" (afterMagda Eisenhardtwhom at the time Wanda believed was her biological mother) and \"Agatha\" (after Wanda's mentor Agatha Harkness) for girl. Since Vision hadn't had a last name, Wanda decided to abandon her last name as well, and they planned for the child to not have a last name, so they also considered names \"Alexander\" for a boy and \"Lauren\" for a girl, because these names \"stand out on its own\".[3]Shortly before birth, they changed mind and stopped their choice on \"Thomas\", the middle name of Phineas Horton, because, while Vision was grateful to Horton, he considered the name \"Phineas\" to be outdated, and \"Diana\" afterDiana, goddess of witchcraft.[1]\nShortly before birth, Wanda mentally connected with the child and, like Doctor Strange, felt what she would have only one son.[1]Wanda expected to give birth the second week of May,[3]but the birth started six days earlier.[1]\nDoctor Strange personally delivered the child,Thomas, but much to his shock then suddenly discovered a second child. Even after the boy was born they were unable to register his existence with any instruments or magic. Wanda and Vision named their second sonWilliam, because, despite not having a last name, Vision wanted to carry theWilliamsname forward somehow. Three days after birth the family returned home from hospital.[1]\nThe family lived happily for several months, and every once in a whileWonder Manvisited them to read fables to the twins.[25]\nSome time after their birth, the twins were visited byJohn KowalskiandDeath, because they were curious about the children's nature. Kowalski felt the void in one of the boys, that reminded him about himself. When Wanda confronted them, Death assured her that the twins are in no danger, because their time has not come yet.[13]On another occasion,Mother Righteous, who extensively studied various forms of magic, visited Billy and Tommy in their nursery, presumably fascinated by their nature as well.[11]\nWhen theAvengers, former teammates of Vision and the Scarlet Witch, were arrested by the US government on false charges. They were told that one of the former Avengers betrayed them. After escaping, Avengers discussed and narrowed down the list of suspects to several candidates, including the Scarlet Witch and Vision. Wonder Man came to their house to ask, and they confirmed it wasn't them who betrayed the team. Eventually the team learned it was actually Wanda's brotherPietro Maximoff. Pietro felt betrayed by the Avengers and theInhuman Royal Family, and planned to destroy bothEarthandMoonin revenge. Wanda wanted to personally go to stop him, but Vision asked her to stay with the twins. She created a crystal with holographic images of the twins and Vision brought it with him. Vision managed to stop Pietro by showing him the image and asking if he really hates everyone on both worlds, including his innocent nephews.[26]\nThe Scarlet Witch and Vision soon joined theAvengers West Coast.[27]While they were on missions they left the twins with their grandmotherMartha Williams, until they eventually decided to relocate toAvengers Compoundin theLos Angeles.[10]\nWhen the twins were born,Immortuswas shocked and alarmed. He investigated and discovered that their souls were parts ofMephistoand that Mephisto already sendMaster Pandemoniumafter them.

Wanda was horrified as it meant that the man she loved was now effectively dead. Additional blow was delivered by the appearance of Phineas Horton, creator of the originalHuman Torch. Vision previously told the Avengers that Horton died on his hands and they also believed that the Human Torch's body was used byUltronto create Vision. However, now Horton claimed that Vision's body had nothing to do with the Human Torch and he had no idea who built Vision.[30]In truth, this Horton was actually aSpace Phantomsent by Immortus to destabilize the situation and further confuse the Scarlet Witch.[12]\nWhen Wanda and the Avengers returned to the Compound with Vision's remains, they discovered a distress signal from Miss Bach. Wanda raced to the house where Bach informed her that the twins disappeared from the bathroom. However, when they entered the bathroom Billy and Tommy were there, playing in the water. Miss Bach was shocked, while Wanda was infuriated and fired Bach.[30]Wanda soon hired a new governess,Mrs. Hunter, during the interview Wanda was called byHank Pyminto the lab, while Mrs. Hunter went to the nursery where Billy and Tommy should have been sleeping according to Wanda, but she wasn't able to find the twins.[31]Mrs. Hunter was subsequently also fired.

Tommy reminisced about their lives, about thehomethey had and their mom and dad and how Vision taught Tommy to walk, but Billy hadn't had these memories. To console and cheer them up America told them about theUtopian Parallel. Mephisto found them again and promised to restore America Chavez' powers, if she give his \"wayward offsprings\" to him, but she refused. She used the Crystal to open the portal and pushed Mephisto into it. The twins then also used the Crystal to open another portal and continued to escape from the Hell Lord.[17]\nNo matter how many times they escaped and hid, Mephisto continued to chase after them. Some time later, the twins appeared in theMidnight Chapel. It was observed and possibly orchestrated byYoung ImmortusandM'Kraan,[5]who called them \"demiurgic stowaways\". To protect the kids from Mephisto, her grandfather, M'Kraan cast a spell on him. Unable to take them himself, Mephisto sent his son demonBlackheartafter Billy and Tommy.[6]\nVia the Chapel the twins entered theAvengers Academy Campus. There they were first seen byWalpurgis, the magical purple cat who was the son ofAgatha Harkness's familiar'sEbonyand then also by Walpurgis' ownerBrielle Brooks.[6]They were happy to play with Walpurgis, but spooked when Brielle saw them so they run away. They separated and decided to rendezvous back in theMidnight Chapel. Blackheart entered the Campus and almost captured Billy, but he was saved by Brielle. Tommy meanwhile went to the infirmary and helpedShela Sextonto heal and awaken and then lead her to the Chapel. All four reunited there, but were stopped by Blackheart. Shela used her powers on him and this contact shocked Blackheart and he allowed his brothers to go and be free and happy, like he never could.[7]\nUnder unknown circumstances, Billy and Tommy were later reincarnated asBilly KaplanandTommy Shepherd,[8]but they forgot everything about their original lives and each other. Kaplan and Shepherd grew up separately in different families and hadn't met each other until they were 16 years old. Ironically, both were included by Vision into theAvengers Fail-Safe Programas being related to the Avengers, without him realizing that they were his reincarnated sons.[36][37]Kaplan and Shepherd also had no idea why they were included into the Fail-Safe Program, untilSuper-Skrulltold them about Wanda and Vision's twins.[38]Doubly ironic, the Fail-Safe Program was used to assemble theYoung AvengersbyIron Lad, who was a time-traveller from the 30th century and was a younger version of Young Immortus who assisted original Billy and Tommy,[5]and also was a chronologically divergent version ofImmortuswho tried to prevent their birth.[12]\nYears after the loss of the twins, Vision regained his original memories and personality and was traumatized to learn that his children were gone and he couldn't even talk about them with Wanda and could only grieve alone.[39]The Avengers reluctantly kept the truth about Billy and Tommy's existence from Wanda for years. One day, while contemplating a pregnancy scare of her own with Wanda,Janet Van Dyneslipped up and alluded to her attempt at raising the two kids. Janet brushed off her comment, but Wanda was left unsettled. She visitedAgatha Harknessand demanded answers from her, and apparently, Agatha revealed the truth before Wanda killed her.[14]\nThe revelation greatly enraged and agitated Wanda and she desperately wanted to bring Billy and Tommy back no matter the cost. She sought the help fromDoctor Doomand together they used magic to capture the Life Force, the only power that could possibly resurrect the twins. However, they underestimated the Life Force, it possessed Wanda's body and amplified her powers into reality warping, but also affected her mind.[40]She returned to Agatha's house, and lived under the illusion in which Agatha was still alive as were Billy and Tommy. Wanda's power also affected the world around and projected her anger on the Avengers. Consciously and subconsciously she caused multiple events that lead to the death of several of her friends and teammates, including Vision, and to thedisassemblingof the Avengers. Eventually,Doctor Strangeconfronted Wanda and used theEye of Agamottoon her to force her to accept the true reality which unfortunately further affected her mind.[14]\nThe Scarlet Witch was brought away byMagneto(who then was considered to be her father) to theGenosha,[14]whereCharles Xaviertried to help her regain control over her mind and powers. Unfortunately, she was constantly recreating the scene of Billy and Tommy's birth, no matter how many times Xavier tried to help. Each time he confronted her with the truth, she was just slipping further away and each time it became harder to keep her mind in reality. Xavier eventually realized that he couldn't control Wanda for much longer, sooner or later she would completely lose herself. Xavier gathered the Avengers and theX-Mento decide Wanda's fate and they went to Genosha.[41]Before they could do anythingPietro Maximoffbrought Xavier away and convinced Wanda to combine his telepathy and her reality warping to change the world. She transformed the world into theHouse of Mwhere (thanks to Xavier's telepathy), everyone gotten that they wanted the most. Wanda herself was reunited withBillyandTommyand lived happily with them. Others eventually realized the truth about the world and confronted Magneto, while Doctor Strange once again forced Wanda to accept reality and the lose of the twins. Unfortunately, it finally snapped Wanda's sanity and she cast one last spell, \"No More Mutants\" thatdepoweredalmost all mutants on the planet and fundamentally changed the world for years to come.[15][16]"

Natas claims that he was a slave-driver named Phao Na Tash. He served an unnamed Pharaoh and took part in the building of a pyramid. His job was to discipline the slaves. He mercilessly whipped the \"stubborn\" slaves. He took delight in lashing small children.\nOne day while whipping a young boy namedBucka(the supposed previous incarnation of Bucky), Na Tash heard the boy claim thatHercules(the supposed previous incarnation of Captain America) would come to his rescue. Na Tash had heard of the hero in question, but was certain that he would never dare to come to this place of torment. He was wrong about this. Hercules turned up a moment later and challenged the \"foul fiend\" to a duel. Na Tash turned around to face his foe, and received a powerful blow from the bare fists of the hero.\nNa Tash was able to counter-attack with his whip. However, Hercules turned out to be invulnerable to the pain and laughed at the futile efforts of Na Tash. Hercules started releasing the slaves, while Na Tash left to gather the men under his command. Na Tash led a small army in attacking the hero with deadly weapons. Hercules was only armed with a shield, but started taking out the villains with his own attacks. An encouraged Bucka used his own bare fists to take down foes. With all his men down for the count, Na Tash run away from the battle.\nNa Tash took refuge in his own, unfinished pyramid. Hercules and Bucka tracked him there and were eager to finish him. Na Tash decided to set a trap for them. He moved an unbalanced stone of the pyramid in an attempt to crush his pursuers underneath it. The attack failed and had an unwelcome effect. It caused another unbalanced stone to fall on Na Tash, mortally wounding him.\nThe dying man had a last surprise for the two heroes. In his life, Na Tash had studied the \"hidden secrets of the soul\". He cursed Hercules, promising that Na Tash will be born again and have a rematch with the hero. And the next time, victory would be his. He then died from his wounds. The heroes did not believe him and soon left the area, planning their next mission. According to Natas, Hercules and Bucka had many adventures, \"before they too met the grave.\"\nDiablo Natas circa 1313 AD\nIn the year 1313 AD, Natas used his magical powers to put the small town to sleep and cursed its people to never wake again. Everyone fell asleep where they stood, their bodies left in the streets of the town. Natas walked satisfied through this town of \"living dead\", where the people still lived but could not defend themselves anymore. Natas gloated that the wolves and buzzards would eventually arrive to devour the unmoving bodies. He decided to steal the wealth of these people, since they no longer needed it.[1]\nBy coincidence, the knightCaptain Amerigoand his squireBucky, the era's apparent versions of Captain America and Bucky, entered the town while seeking a room for the night. The Captain soon realized that he could not wake the townspeople and found it strange. Bucky initially suspected that the people were simply drunk. Discovering Natas counting his stolen gold, the Captain drew his sword and attacked the apparent thief.\nNatas was able to use a spell to paralyze the Captain. Studying his foe, Natas realized that he was the reincarnation of his old foe Hercules. He quickly explained their shared history to the helpless Captain. He took over the Captain's sword and prepared to pierce the man's throat with it. He claimed that once the Captain died, their paths would never cross again in future ages. He was soon attacked by Bucky, who was eager to save his employer.\nNatas and Bucky faced each other in combat. Natas was armed with the sword, while Bucky relied on his bare fists. Bucky turned out to be a more skilled fighter. He disarmed Natas and beat him up. A battered and bruised Natas was forced to release the knight, in order to escape a further beating by the enraged Bucky. Once Bucky let go of him, Natas tried to cast another spell. A punch from the Captain took him down again.\nAn enraged Captain forced Natas to reverse his spell on the town, even though Natas claimed that the price for the counter-spell would be the sorcerer's own life. With the counter-spell performed, the people awoke while Natas was suddenly on death's door. He had reportedly sold his soul for the original spell and undoing it cost him dearly. With his dying words, Natas once more sword vengeance against the two heroes in a future incarnation. He predicted that the next incarnation of Hercules would be called Captain America.\nThe Captain was left wondering if this \"evil soul\" could be reborn. Bucky shuddered at the thought.\nWhatever the truth may be, the man known as Emil Natas was a criminal who was active in the 1940s and led the Black Gang. According to Captain America, the Black Gang was responsible for mayhem, murdering, and sabotage for \"the war enemy\" ofWorld War II, which likely means that Natas was working for the Axis Powers.\nNatas legitimately practiced medicine from his office in Rhode Island as a front for his operations. When Captain America and Bucky were called in to break the Black Gang's operation, they captured most of the gang, but the captured criminals refused to reveal the name of their leader. Bucky then discovered that a gang member had dropped a business card for Dr. Natas' office. He suspected that Natas was the secret leader of the gang.\nSuspecting that Natas is the leader of the gang, Captain America and Bucky headed to his office to learn the truth. Captain America decided to pose as a patient, and pretended to have a strained shoulder that needed treatment. Natas led him to an examination table and instructed him to lie down. Cap obeyed the instruction and Natas moved swiftly to shackle him to the table. Bucky attempted to free Cap, but Natas knocked out the \"brat\" (as he called him) with a chloroform-soaked rag. He shackled Bucky to another examination table.\nNatas asked his captured foes if they recognized him. Cap was surprised and claimed they have never met before. Natas answered by claiming that they had met many times before. They had met \"since the beginning of time\", in former lives. Bucky had no idea what Natas was talking about and figured the villain was a \"madman\". Cap realized that Natas was talking about reincarnation, the concept of returning to life on Earth \"century after century.\" Natas attempted to prove his claims to the two heroes by using a device that apparently probed their minds and showed them their past life memories.\nAfter showing the two heroes their last two apparent encounters, Natas proclaimed that he had been born again and again. Cap was skeptical about his claims. Natas answered that displaying the past for his foe was \"a foolish waste of time\". He pulled out a dagger and attempted to stab Captain America through the heart. He gloated that this was their third encounter and now victory was finally his. However, Cap had been working on his shackles throughout his captivity and waited for an opportunity. Cap broke free and punched Natas.\nNatas pulled out a handgun and shot at Cap at almost point-blank range. Cap used his shield to defend himself and his fist to knock down Natas. Natas fell against a medical cabinet and tipped over an open bottle. The bottle contained cyanide and the liquid contents fell on Natas' open mouth. Fatally poisoned, Natas was still able to speak. He prophesied that he will be born for a fourth time in the far future. He would face the heroes again and win. He then died."

Raised with high moral ideals, he uses his incredible strength, speed, flight and various other superpowers to fight evil and to protect the innocent. In his civilian identity he isClark Kent, a mild-mannered reporter working for theDaily PlanetinMetropolis. He is a founding member of theJustice League of Americaand a member of theLegion of Super-Heroesin the30th Century.\nMain article:The Man of Steel Vol 1\nWhen the planetKryptonwas on the brink of destruction, married scientistsJor-ElandLara Lor-Vanbuilt arocketthey could use to save their unborn sonKal-Elin hisgestation chamber. Jor-El administered a serum[7][8]that would prevent Kal from dying due to the biological link with Krypton that all Kryptonians had to an artifact calledthe Eradicator. Jor-El planned to send his son to a distant planet orbiting a yellow sun he had been studying for some time. Just before Krypton finally came to an end, his parents sent him to the planet -Earth.\nClark first tries on theSupermancostume.\nUpon landing, the child was discovered byJonathanandMartha KentinSmallville, Kansas. The kindly couple decided they would adopt and raise him, naming himClark Kent. Apparently, a normal child at first,[9]Clark's abilities increased steadily as he grew up, with super-strength and invulnerability manifesting at an early age and the power of flight developing during high school. When he was 18 years old, his adopted parents revealed the rocket and his foreign heritage to their son, leading Clark to the decision that he would become a hero in secret and use his powers to protect innocents.[10]\nHe operated this way for seven years until he was forced to save a spaceplane in front of crowds of people, meeting reporterLois Lanefor the first time at age 25. He was attracted to her the moment they met and felt like a spark had developed between them, before a mob of inquisitive people descended on him. Deciding that it was time for him to become a public figure, Clark and his father designed asymbolfor him to wear while Martha created a costume. In his secret identity, he would drastically change his physical appearance and mannerisms while wearing spectacles so that nobody would suspect he led a double civilian life.[10]He was dubbedSupermanby Lois Lane.[11]\nDuring his first costumed adventures in Metropolis, he simultaneously pursued his education atMetropolis Universityand put himself through school by working atBalducci's restaurant for two years, where he had a brief affair with an older woman namedRuby Carson[12]He later began his new career as a reporter for theDaily Planetworking for chief-editorPerry White, alongside Lois and cub reporterJimmy Olsen. There, Clark would score the illustrious first documented interview with Superman, which Lois was forever be envious of.[13][14]\nThe media coverage would eventually attract the attention of corrupt business mogulLex Luthor, who tested Superman and tried to get him on the villain's payroll to no avail. Repeated attempts to murderSupermaneventually led toLexCorpdeveloping an imperfect clone of the Kryptonian namedBizarro.[15]\nReturning toSmallvilleafter many years, Superman encountered another Kryptonian rocket, this time with a message from his birth parents that taught him the entire history of Krypton. Superman considered his dual heritage and decided that no matter where he's from, his life on Earth had made him a human and an American.[16]\nIn the early 2000s, Superman's origin wasmysteriously changed, potentially as a result ofZero Hour.\nMain article:Superman: Birthright\n\nBirthright\nReturning toSmallvilleat the age of 25 after freelancing around the world as a reporter, he decided it was time to start making a difference in the world, donning theKryptoniansymbol of hopegiven to him by his parents as his heritage.[20]He designed a costume after traditional Kryptonian clothing with no mask so the public could trust him and moved toMetropolis.[21]\nSecuring a job interview at theDaily PlanetwithPerry White, Clark metJimmy Olsenfor the first time and immediately fell in love withLois Lane. He was forced to make his first public appearance asSuperman, saving both of them when the city was attacked by experimental military helicopters.[22]Lex Luthor was revealed to be responsible in an act of corporate sabotage againstWayne Enterprisesin their first conflict as arch-enemies.[23]\nLuthor announced to the media that he believed Superman was an alien invader.[24]Testing this theory, he discoveredSuperman's weakness by exposing him toGreen Kryptonite.[18]This fear-mongering climaxed in a staged Kryptonian invasion of Metropolis by Luthor, using real troops and holograms to discredit Superman.[25]Superman was ultimately able to end the attacks, exposing Luthor's scheme and proving himself as a hero to humanity.[26]\nLater, Superman's first meeting with Lois wasslightly altered. Once again, their first meeting was when Superman saved her from a failed space shuttle, but Clark was already working at the Daily Planet before they met. Clark and Lois begin to date after that, with the former hiding his identity as Superman.[27]\nIn the wake ofInfinite Crisis, Clark's origin was adjusted yet again, this time restoring much of the history of hisEarth-Onecounterpart.\nMain article:Superman: Secret Origin\nSuperboyand theLegion of Super-Heroes.\nAround this time, he was visited byCosmic Boy,Lightning LadandSaturn Girlof theLegion of Super-Heroesfrom the30th Century, an organization of super-powered teens inspired by his legacy. They took him into the future and showed him a world where he wasn't very different from everyone else.\nWhen Clark returned to the present, he discovered a second rocket had also escaped Krypton after he had and landed on Earth. This rocket containedKrypto the Superdog.[29]\nMoving toMetropolisas an adult, he began work as a reporter at the economically failingDaily Planet. Clark made his debut asSupermanwhen he caughtLois Lanefalling off of theLexCorpskyscraper.[30]\nLex Luthor was quick to become an enemy of Superman when he accused the hero of being an alien threat to humanity. The Daily Planet was the only newspaper to portray him in a positive light, with his first recorded photograph being taken byJimmy Olsen.[31]This public distrust lead to intervention byGeneral Sam Laneof the United States Army, who createdMetalloto stop him.[32]Superman regained popular approval by proving that he was only interested in saving lives, and the Daily Planet became the most popular newspaper in town because it retained Superman exclusives.[33]\nMain article:Justice League Origins\nSuperman's first meeting with another modern superhero was withBatmaninGotham City. He tried to arrest the Bat at first, but realized they were on the same side, and teamed up to solve a series of murders committed byMagpie.[34]\nThis story was eventually changed byMister Mxyzptlk, and Superman had now first met Batman on a cruise ship when they teamed up to fight theCrime SyndicateandDeathstroke.[35]\nTheJustice League of Americawas formed by Superman,Batman,Wonder Woman,The Flash,Green Lantern,AquamanandMartian ManhunterafterAppellaxiansattacked Earth.[36]\nSuperman would have his first encounters withArathaza,Bloodsport, theCircle, theFearsome Five,Chemo,Rampage,Mister Mxyzptlkand theSilver Banshee.\nIn those first early adventures, Superman often found himself pitted against Lex Luthor, who had vowed to destroy the hated \"alien\" and reclaim his place as the First Son of Metropolis. Luthor also dismissed the suggestion that Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same, rationalizing that no one who had the power of Superman would ever pretend to be a mere human like Clark Kent.[37]Superman also had his first encounter with the New GodDarkseid, who teleported him toApokolips.[38]Superman remained on Apokolips for some time, eventually rallying the dregs of that society in a resistance against their despotic ruler, but the revolution was unsuccessful and Superman was returned to Earth.[39]\nClark briefly datedWonder Womanafter being contacted by her publicistMyndi Mayer. He immediately kissed her after meeting her, something which shocked and amused her. Clark later apologized but admitted that, when they first met, he was smitten by her, which made Diana uncomfortable, as she was new to such things. After a crisis involving Darkseid and the Olympian gods was resolved, they decided they were not right for each other and would just remain friends.[40][41][42][7][43]\nSuperman voluntarily leaves Earth\nA version of a young Lex Luthor from a pocket universe resembling pre-crisis earth-one accidentally releasedGeneral Zod,FaoraandQuex-Ul, three Kryptonian criminals, from the Phantom Zone, and, after they had destroyed an entire pocket dimensions, were judged by Superman to deserve capital punishment and killed withGreen Kryptonite.[44]The guilt of taking a life weighed heavily upon Superman, with it being amplified further byMilton Fine (New Earth)[45]He had a psychotic break, which caused him to unknowingly assume the identity ofGangbuster. Superman decided, after what he'd done, that he had to leave Earth and began a self-imposed exile in space.[46]\nAfter several adventures in outer space, Superman was captured by the artificial gladiator planetWarworldand encountered its rulerMongulfor the first time. Superman was pitted in a gladiatorial match againstDraagain the arena, but, when he refused to kill Draaga, was forced to fight Mongul. Rallying the other fighters to his aid, Superman beat Mongul and deposed him as Warworld's leader, replacing him withDraaga. Having found peace with executing Zod and the other Kryptonian criminals, Superman returned to Earth.[47]\nClark as Krypton Man\nOnce he returned, Superman battled theEradicator, a sentient artifact he encountered on the Warworld, that attempted to impose its own designs on Earth. He defeated the artifact and buried it in the Antarctic, later discovering it had then created a vast underground fortress — theFortress of Solitude. The Eradicator, still active, began to melt some of the polar ice cap and mind-controlled Superman to change into the so-calledKrypton Man. Though he caused havoc in his brainwashed state, Superman broke free from the programming with the help of his adoptive parent and hurled the Eradicator and his Krypton Man costume into the sun.[48]\nSuperman first encountered his other greatest foe (apart from Lex Luthor) Brainiac when the alien sought to put his mind in the body of a human illusionist, Milton Fine \"The Amazing Brainiac.\" He attacked Superman, but Fine was able to temporarily overcome Brainiac's control.[49]Brainiac was subsequently captured by Luthor and experimented on - gaining a new body and fleeing into space.[50]\nAround this time, Clark proposed to Lois Lane and she accepted,[51]also finally revealing his secret identity to her.[52]After a couple weeks of keeping Clark's secret, Lois found that she was a little peeved to think that Clark had been using his role as Superman to gain an advantage over her as a reporter for all those years, and the two developed a sort of professional rivalry.[53]\nA young man named Lex Luthor II, the alleged son of the late Lex Luthor, who had seemingly gotten cancer and died in a plane crash months prior, arrived in Metropolis and laid claim to his father's empire. Superman investigated the man but believed his story - never realizing the \"son\" was really the original Lex Luthor in a cloned new body![54]\nBrainiac would eventually return to Earth at the helm of Warworld. Threatened with total invasion, Superman rallied Earth's hero and personally lead the retaliation on Warworld. In a massive battle, Brainiac was beaten and lobotomized, and Earth's heroes returned home. Superman then decided to join the newly reformedJustice Leagueon a full-time basis.[55]\nMain article:Death and Return of Superman\nThe Death of Superman\nOne day, a monstrous alien beast calledDoomsdayemerged in easternOhioand made its way towards Metropolis.[56]The beast single-handedly defeated the Justice League when the team rallied to stop it.[57]Superman battled the creature across several states, eventually landing in Metropolis itself.[58]After a long, intense battle, Superman managed to finally put down the monster but collapsed as he did so, dying in Lois' arms.[59]\nAll attempts to revive Superman failed, and he was pronounced dead. Clark Kent was presumed to have been one of the hundreds killed in Doomsday's rampage.[60]Superman was buried with full honors, with hundreds of heads of state and several hundred thousand onlookers present, beneath a large statue in Centennial Park. The Justice League and other heroes marched behind the casket, following their leader (official or not) one last time. Lois, Lana Lang and the Kents were all devastated.[61]Cadmus, a secret science operation, stole the body from the tomb, but Supergirl retrieved it and reburied him. Lex Luthor would gloat that, even though he wasn't the one to kill Superman, by providing funding for the tomb, he at least \"buried him.\nJonathan Kent, after suffering from a heart attack, had a near death experience where he saw Clark in the afterlife who encouraged him to keep living. Jonathan would recover and took this as a sign that his son wasn't really dead.[62]Despite this, four new heroes arrived in Metropolis, all claiming to be Superman: \"The Man of Tomorrow,\" \"The Last Son of Krypton,\" \"The Man of Steel,\" and \"The Metropolis Kid.\" A trip to the real Superman's tomb revealed it to be empty.[63]\nCults began to spring up in Metropolis, worshiping any one of the four new Supermen as messiahs.President Bill Clintonwas saved by theCyborg Supermanand officially endorsed him as the real Superman. Lois, however, endorsedSteel, believing he was the closest to the ideal of Superman.\nOne impostor, the artifact known as theEradicatorthat had battled Superman in the past, had actually returned and went to Superman's tomb to try to use his body as a new vessel. Sensing Superman's soul was still lingering inside, the artifact fashioned a new body from concrete in Superman's image and placed Kal-El's body in a regeneration matrix that was bombarded with sunlight, in hopes of controlling him once he was revived. Despite this plan, the Eradicator accidentally convinced itself it reallywasSuperman.[64]\nSuperman returns\nWhen Superman was finally revived in the Fortress, he was weak and powerless but traveled to Metropolis anyway. When he arrived, he was met by Lex Luthor II, Lois and others, who were shocked when a black-suited Superman emerged and announcedhewas the real Superman.[65]Upon learning thatCoast Cityhad just been destroyed by the Cyborg Superman, the real Superman joined with Superboy, Supergirl and Steel to do battle with the Cyborg. In the fight, Clark learned Cyborg Superman's true identity - Hank Henshaw - and that Henshaw had planned to impersonate the hero and destroy the world, ruining Superman's legacy. With all his might returning to him, Clark defeated Cyborg Superman.[66]\nSuperman returned to Metropolis and had to convince the city that he was therealSuperman - for real this time. Unfortunately, he had to \"reacquire\" the right to the name and symbol \"Superman,\" but after helping the young Superboy come to terms with his origins as a clone of Clark and accept himself as \"Superboy\", the kid declared Clark once and for all the real Superman.[67]\nSuperman, with the help of the shapeshifting Supergirl, managed to come up with a plausible way of \"resurrecting\" Clark Kent, who had not been seen since Superman's death. Supergirl took Clark's form, and Superman proceeded to \"find\" Clark in the rubble of a destroyed building. Jimmy got a picture of Superman and Clark side-by-side, proving to the world they were different people.\nAfter weeks of returning to business-as-usual saving Metropolis, Superman received a tip that the monster that killed him - Doomsday - was not dead and was being housed onApokolips. Suffering from nightmares of the creature, Superman went to Apokolips for a rematch. Superman pursued Doomsday when he escaped Apokolips to the planetCalatonand fought the beast to a standstill. Luckily, Superman was able to teleport Doomsday into the distant future—just before the universe came to an end. This allowed him to find a little peace of mind, although he regretted the creature's apparent death.[68]\nSuperman vs. Bizarro\nLex Luthor, whose cloned body was slowly decaying, attempted to clone Superman again using Dr. Teng's procedure, resulting in a secondBizarro Superman. Thinking that he was the real Superman, this Bizarro escaped from Luthor and kidnapped Lois Lane. Lois managed to escape from \"Bizarro World,\" a warehouse where Bizarro had attempted to recreate Metropolis in his own warped way. His memories fragmented, Bizarro flew to Smallville and tried kidnapping Lana Lang, not understanding why she resisted him. Superman arrived and drove Bizarro back to Metropolis[69]where Luthor reclaimed the clone and killed it.[70]\nAt the same time, Superman noticed his powers had begun to grow out of control; his was absorbing far too much energy from the sun, and his size and powers grew exponentially. After several failed attempts at controlling the situation, Superman was only cured after allowing theParasiteto purge him of the excess energy.[71]\nLuthor, blamingProject Cadmusfor his deteriorating clone body, orchestrated an all-out war between the Project and the Underworlders. The conflict spilled out onto the streets of Metropolis, and even Superman had trouble containing it. Luthor went even further, detonating bombs all over the city, prompting an evacuation. Luthor and his army of clones discovered too late that their war was in vain, and that the fallout from the missiles used to fight Cyborg-Superman in Engine City was really to blame. UsingGuardian'sDNA, Cadmus was able to create a cure, saving the lives ofSuperboyand the Newsboy Legion. Luthor ordered his army to try to steal the cure, nearly destroying Cadmus.[72]\nThe Fall of Metropolis\nLuthor's schemes are revealed to the world on live TV, thanks to the efforts of Lois Lane and Dr.Gretchen Kelly. Luthor threatened to launch missiles into the heart of Metropolis, but Superman talked him down. Another soldier, however, launched them anyway, devastating most of the city, including destroying all of the major skyscrapers. At this point, Luthor was finally taken into custody.[73]\nMetropolis would lay in ruins for several weeks, having to contend with several \"safeguards\" left in place by Lex Luthor (giant robots, hallucinogenic gases, etc.) as well as Luthor himself, having escaped the police, wielding Superman's own discarded Kryptonian war suit. Luthor was captured again, and his condition worsened to the point he was left in a vegetative state.[74][75]\nThanks toZatannamagic and Superman's might, Metropolis was restored to its former glory.[76]\nDuring a fight withConduit, a new villain who hated both SupermanandClark Kent separately, Superman's former tomb in Centennial Park was destroyed, and it was discovered that there was a dead body inside that looked just like Superman. This caused the world to wonder if the Superman protecting their city was a fraud.[77]Superman investigates who of his villains would have pulled off such a hoax but, after interrogating them, eliminates Luthor, theEradicator,DarkseidandMister Mxyzptlkas suspects.\nSuperman's grip on reality began to break down, causing his behavior to become more erratic. All of this was because the real culprit wasBrainiac, who had recovered from his being formerly lobotomized and returned to Earth.[78]When Superman finally learned the truth, he confronted Brainiac in the streets of Metropolis before the villain fled.[79]\nLois and Clark Reunited\nWeeks later, Superman's life was turned upside down when Conduit learned that the two men he hated most - Superman and Clark Kent - were the same person. Conduit blew up the Kent's farmhouse, kidnapped Jimmy Olsen, attacked Lana Lang, and confronted Superman himself.[80]After Conduit apparently kills Lois and the Kents, Clark, in his rage, declared that he would no longer be Superman, violently ripping his suit off and incinerating it with his heat vision.[81]\nConduit challenged Superman to a one-on-one battle in a mock-version of Smallville, but his rage during the fight resulted in Conduit \"self-destructing.\"[82]After the fight, Superman learned that the Kents and Lois had not actually been killed, and that their deaths had been faked. Clark reunited with his parents and questioned whether he needed a secret identity if it put his loved ones in danger. However, after a conversation with Lois put things in perspective, he realized how much he would be giving up by not being Clark Kent.[83]\nAfter a battle with theParasiteleaves him near death, Superman was arrested by Brute at the behest of an intergalactic group known as theTribunal. Superman was brought into space and put on trial for the destruction of Krypton. The Tribunal argued that it was Superman's ancestor's fault that Krypton was destroyed and, because they believed that the sins of the father should be paid by their sons, found him guilty of the planet's destruction.[84]\nTheAlpha Centurionrallied together aSuperman Rescue Squadwhile Superman managed a jail break with some fellow prisoners.[85]After several adventures in space, Superman and the Rescue Squad all ended up on the Tribunal's home world, each captured by theCyborg Superman, working for the Tribunal. When the Cyborg betrayed the Tribunal, Superman saved all its members, despite their guilty verdict, because it was the right thing to do. The Tribunal decided to \"commute his sentence\" and sentenced him to never give up his \"never-ending battle.\" Superman and the team returned to Earth triumphant.[86]\nA tough breakup\nEven though Lex Luthor (fully recovered from his failing clone body thanks to a deal withNeron) was on the run, Superman's life was still troubled. After a number of factors, Lois broke off their longtime engagement.[87]One of the reasons that lead to Lois' decision was the fact that Superman refused to kill theJokerwhen her own life was threatened by the clown.\nSuperman reluctantly accepted that their relationship was over and went to Smallville to deal with his feelings with his parents.[88]\nSuperman also had to contend with the return of Brainiac, who switched his mind into Superman's and Superman's into the body of a young mental patient,Chas Cassidy, before briefly capturing all of Metropolis. He used the citizens of the city as a vast data storage unit until Superman—in Chas's body—was able to breach his fortress. Now in separate bodies, Superman and Chas were able to put everybody back in their right bodies and save the city.[89]\nLois, frustrated that she had become so reliant on Superman, decided to take a foreign correspondent position overseas and parted with Clark on good terms.[90]Not long after, Perry White revealed to Clark that he would be taking a leave of absence because he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. In his absence, Perry promoted Clark to his position as lead editor of theDaily Planet. On the same night, Superman encounteredObsession, who went on a rampage after Superman did not return her affection, causing him to wonder if he had been smothering Lois in the same way at the end of their relationship.[91]\nTolos, an alien wizard Superman encountered while on the run from the Tribunal, arrived on Earth and attempted to collect Superman in his bottle city ofKandor.[92]Superman managed to defeat the wizard but was unable to free the Kandorians from their prison.[93]When the field around Kandor began to destabilize, Superman took the bottled city to the Fortress of Solitude (which had been rebuilt after its destruction by a single surviving Kryptonian robot), hoping to find something to save the city.[94]\nSuperman's powers were briefly lost when the Earth's sun was threatened by theSun-Eater, forcing Earth's heroes to band together to reignite it.[95]He would later regain them with the help ofMetronand otherNew Gods.[96]\nThe Wedding of Clark Kent and Lois Lane\nAfter the world ending threat with the sun had been resolved, Lois returned from her time abroad and reconciled with Clark; the two decided to resume their engagement and get married right away. Lucy Lane threw Lois a bridal shower and a bachelorette party, while Clark had a bachelor party thrown at theAce O' Clubs. Jimmy Olsen and Lucy Lane were chosen as best man and maid of honor. Perry White attended the wedding ceremony, but unfortunately didn't feel well enough to make the reception. Batman revealed that an apartment building where Lois wanted to rent was owned by Bruce Wayne, and so, as a wedding gift, allowed for Clark and Lois to move into the building.[97]\nLois and Clark went on a honeymoon in Hawaii, where Clark was kidnapped by terrorists, and Lois had to come to his rescue.[98]\nIn the meantime, Superman's old foes formed aSuperman Revenge Squadand, when he returned, went after him but still did not probe a threat to Big Blue.[99]\nAfter a menace fromKnow Manand an invasion by theWhite Martians, Superman was one of the seven charter members of the newly reformed JLA.[100]\nSuperman experienced a weird power fluctuation that rendered him in the form of pure energy. Needing a containment suit, he found that he was considerably faster, intangible, and able to interact with computers in this energy form. He also lost his vulnerability to Kryptonite. However, he found that he was weaker to energy disruption and lost his super strength. Furthermore, when he changed back into Clark Kent, he was rendered powerless.[101]\nAt this time, Perry White returned to theDaily Planet, his cancer now in remission, and Clark returned to his position as a reporter.[102]\nSuperman Red\nSuperman Blue\nMorgan Edgecreated a newSuperman Revenge Squadand sicked them on Superman. Jimmy Olsen, meanwhile, believed he had figured out his best friend Superman's secret identity and planned to announce it on television.[103]Jimmy chickened out though and falsely announced that Superman did not have a secret identity, which caused him to be fired.[104]\nTheCyborg Supermanand theToymanjoined forces in an attempt to destroy Superman's energy form, but instead Superman was split into a second form - the aggressive Superman Red and the calmer Superman Blue.[105]\nA race of monsters known as theMillennium Giantswere summoned on Earth that began to march over the world, causing havoc and destruction, obliterating the city ofThiena Na Ogeand most of the nation of Markovia in their path. The JLA rallied to take up the fight, and the two Supermen were finally able to destroy the giants, risking their lives in the process.[106]Not only was the Earth saved, but Superman was restored to his original singular form with all his original powers.[107]\nSuperman had another rematch withDoomsdayaround this time. After a battle with Superman had ruined his body,Brainiacmanaged to retrieve Doomsday and download his mind into the brute's body. With his new power, he easily took down the Justice League. While delivering Lana Lang's baby to a hospital after she had given birth prematurely, Superman was ambushed by Brainiac/Doomsday, who kidnapped the baby to grow a new clone for himself. Fortunately, Superman was able to stop this plan, save the baby and eject Brainiac from Doomsday. Brainiac was forced into a new robotic body, and Doomsday was taken to the moon, broken apart into pieces, and stored away.[108]\nHard times fell on the Daily Planet, and the owners reluctantly sold the company to Lex Luthor — who promptly closed its doors and fired nearly everyone.[109]Out of work, Clark decided to resume his book-writing career but was horrified to find that the fictional situations he wrote about were actually coming true.[110][111]Superman essentially abandoned his life as Clark Kent, patrolling the Earth 24/7, paranoid of his own prophetic thoughts. Believing even this dedication wasn't enough, Superman built an army of Superman robots to help him with his goal.\nAround this time, Superman offeredSuperboy, his partial clone, the genuine Kryptonian name of a distant relative of his, \"Kon-El,\" believing the two were like family. Superboy gratefully accepted.[112]\nA tyrant for peace\nWhen Superman believed that Lex Luthor had been attempting to create synthetic Kryptonite, the Man of Steel sliced LexCorp Tower in half, casting the top half into outer space. The SCU tried to arrest him, but Superman refused to allow them to. The JLA intervened and agreed that Superman crossed a line.[113]The JLA were unable to defeat his army of Superman robots to apprehend him and, during the battle, the truth of Superman's recent behavior were made clear — he has been manipulated by the villainDominus![114]\nWhile the U.N. declared war on Superman, Lois Lane managed to break into the Fortress of Solitude and free Superman from the spell Dominus had on him.[115]Dominus regained control though, and, while a horde of Superman robots attacked the U.N. Building, Luthor caused the orbiting half of his old tower (laced with synthetic Kryptonite) to crash down on the Fortress, shattering its defenses and reducing it to ruins.[116]Superman broke his hold from Dominus and banished the supervillain to the Phantom Zone once and for all.[117]\nSuperman was back to normal, but the world was still uneasy. Many people no longer trusted him, some questioning if he was indeed the real Superman while others feared that he could lose control again. Superman realized that he would have to win back people's trust one day at a time.[118]WhenBrainiac 2.5returned to Earth, planning on destroying the planet, Superman saved the day once again and firmly regained the public's trust.[119]\nNear the end of the millennium, Lex Luthor sold the Daily Planet toBruce Waynefor $1, but did not publicly disclose the reason for doing so. The real reason was that Lois Lane made a deal with him, promising to bury one story — no matter what it was — in exchange for him allowing the Planet to return. Lois kept this secret even from Clark. Everyone was hired back: Jimmy came back on as a photographer, Lois had her city beat back, and Clark was assigned as a foreign correspondent.\nThat same day,Mongularrived on Earth seeking help from Superman to deal with a threat facing the entire galaxy — the threat ofImperiex. Superman began special training with Mongul. Concurrently, Jimmy discovered a photograph of Superman wearing a wedding band. Superman confided in Jimmy that he was actually married (though he did not say to whom) before going off into space with Mongul to battle Imperiex near Jupiter. The two succeeded in destroying the construct Imperiex was building to destroy the solar system. Predictably, Mongul then double-crossed Superman, but Superman had anticipated this and turned him over toLobo. Unknown to Clark, the being defeated near Jupiter was not the true Imperiex but merely one of his thousands of drones.[120]\nSuperman battles Brainiac 13 to stop Y2K\nOn New Year's Eve 1999, Lex Luthor planned a spectacular party in Metropolis to usher in the New Year. Clark, Lois and the Kents all attended. Unfortunately, Y2K actually occurred — all because of the arrival of Brainiac 2.5, who unleashed a computer virus that crippled the world's computers, leading all the world's heroes to desperately try to keep the peace as a worldwide blackout ensued. Superman andGreen Lanternhad to go into orbit to stop thousands of nuclear missiles launched when the blackout hit.[121]\nEven though Earth's heroes managed to defeat Brain 2.5, a future version of Brainiac called Brainiac 13 came back in time to continue its earlier version's mission and forcefully \"upgrade\" the Earth. Brainiac 2.5, on the verge of death, downloaded its consciousness into Lex Luthor's daughterLena Luthor.\nSuperman was only able to stop B13 by utilizing a Kryptonian battlesuit. However, while his plan had been to trap B13 in the suit, Lex Luthor made a deal with the supervillain to hand over his daughter (still housing Brainiac 2.5's essence) and allowed B13 to escape into space, in exchange for keeping Metropolis upgraded as the very real City of Tomorrow. Superman vowed to find Lena and rescue her — and to make Luthor pay.[122]\nAfter the crisis, Superman worked with Steel to rebuild a brand newFortress of Solitudein a pocket dimension.[123]\nSuperman briefly became deathly ill with a Kryptonite-cancer but theAtom,Steel,SuperboyandSupergirlshrank down and removed the tumor.[124]Sometime later, the Kryptonite-tumor would get stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs and return as a villain namedKancer.[125]\nMister Mxyzptlkmade his return shortly, thereafter, causing his greatest disaster ever when he decided to visit theJokerat theSlaband was tricked into giving Joker 99.9 percent of his power. The Joker used the awesome power ofMister Mxyzptlkto remake the entire universe in his own twisted image.[126]Superman tried to rally the JLA and his other allies in a desperate struggle against the Joker, who was committed to first torturing all of creation and then hoping to destroy it. He brutally killed Superman's friends and loved ones before his eyes.\nA surreal battle ensued before Superman managed to discover the \"rule\" that allowed him to finally defeat the Joker — the Joker could not exist without Batman. Everything was put back as it was, with no one remembering what had happened except for Superman. Batman, who had been horribly tortured by Joker over and over, also still remembered every minute of it, but Superman asked theSpectreto transfer the memories ... into the Joker.[127]\nLuthor wins the Presidency\nLex Luthor, regarded as a national hero for his perceived role in the past several world-threatening crises, was elected President of the United States, withPete Rossas his Vice President. With his arch-nemesis in the White House, Superman was understandably very upset.[128]\nSuperman encountered a rocket ship from his father Jor-El in the field near his parents' house in Smallville. The rocket contained a message detailing a different history of Krypton than the one he had learned when he was younger. Jor-El admitted in his message that he had lied about Krypton's history before so that he could more easily embrace his heritage growing up. Superman had trouble reconciling this new information, and, learning he could use thePhantom Zoneto go back in time to Krypton, embarked on a journey to learn the truth.\nSuperman encountered a very different Krypton than the one he ever imagined but got along wonderfully with his parents and their pet,Krypto, until they were attacked by the fanaticalGeneral Zod. Superman and Lois fled back to Earth, accompanied by Krypto, who developed superpowers under Earth's sun.[129]Krypto proved a little too much for life in Metropolis however, and after a fight with Mongul in which the dog almost killed the villain, Superman decided to take Krypto to the Fortress and have a Super-Robot look after him.[130]\nSigns began to appear of an impending intergalactic war withImperiexin which Earth was bound to get dragged into. The Justice League rallied in space, taking on Imperiex's scout drones, but were taken out one by one. Superman watched several of his friends fall and the apparent destruction of Atlantis.[131]\nEvery major superhero team on Earth began taking up arms against Imperiex. Even Superman fought side-by-side with Doomsday, the monster having been revived bySteeland theSuicide Squadon orders from President Luthor, with each destroying dozens of probes before the real Imperiex Prime arrived.[132]With battles against Imperiex drones taking place worldwide, Superman was distracted and missed his wife's call when her father General Sam Lane had been attacked at the White House. With Superman too busy protecting the Earth, Lois' father died.[133]\nPresident Luthor suggested a desperate plan to stop the invasion: Superman would merge with theStrange Visitorand assault Imperiex Prime himself. Following through, the plan was successful, and Imperiex was seemingly destroyed.\nNew costume\nHowever, the Warworld — under the command of Brainiac 13 — arrived and absorbed the energy of Imperiex, continuing the invasion. Brainiac 13 also convincedApokolipsthat Earth had betrayed their peace treaty, causing Darkseid to start a second invasion of Earth as well.[134]Superman, distraught over all the death and destruction, flew into the sun and became super-charged. Using a plan that Superman himself came up with, Superman and Earth's allies boom tubed Warworld to the beginning of time, ending the war.[135]\nSuperman attempted to be sensitive to his wife, who was in a great amount of pain over the loss of her father but was commonly distracted by the never-ending call of justice.[136]\nSuperman would have to fight Jokerized versions of his enemies in aworldwide endgame plotorganized by the Joker.[137]\nLois and her mother traveled extensively throughout Europe, includingRomeandVenice. This prompted more than one person back home to wonder if there was trouble between Lois and Clark. Clark told Perry that Lois had asked for space following her father's death and that he was trying to honor that, though he grew anxious during their time apart.[138]\nAs Lois and her mother prepared to head back home, Lois stated that she didn't want to and wondered if she and Clark hated each other. Ella stated that she stuck by Sam because they could solve any problem together, and real marriages could last through any difficulty. Upon returning, Lois admitted to Clark that she held him responsible for her father's death but that she wanted to work through it with him and needed him, promising to not leave again.[139]\nAround this time, Superman helped his parents open up a new general store in downtown Smallville, and President Luthor deduced that Clark Kent was Superman.[140]\nLois Lane uncovered proof that Luthor knew about the Imperiex invasion long before it actually happened (meaning he could have called for evacuations and saved more lives) but Luthor, per their prior deal for the Daily Planet, ordered her to bury the story. Double crossing Luthor, Lois gave the story to Clark to write, thereby subverting their agreement. When the story came out, Luthor denied the allegations, and a mind scan byMartian Manhunterseemed to prove his innocence. Clark was publicly fired over the incident, but Perry secretly kept him on staff in order to further investigate Luthor.[141]\nManchester Black returned and used his vast mind powers to orchestrate an all-out attack on Superman. Black mind-controlled an entire legion of super-villains to attack all of Superman's loved ones. Superman was forced to face all of his rogues to protect his family. Manchester Black apparently murdered Lois in an attempt to force Superman to kill him (and thereby prove Superman was no better than he was). However, for even in his grief, Superman refused. Black's ruse fell apart, and he revealed that Lois was still alive. Having given up on his fight against the Man of Steel, Black used his mind powers to remove the knowledge that Clark Kent was Superman from Luthor's mind, and then Black killed himself.[142]\nMonths after the incident, Lois discovered that Clark was still working for the Daily Planet in secret without telling her. Perry openly hired Clark back, but Lois used the opportunity to announce she was quitting to work for Channel 3 News.[143]\nSuperman and President Luthor on the same side\nTracing a lead to a supervillain who had been organizing a plot against him for months, Superman confronted a man calling himself 'The General' before realizing this man wasGeneral Zod. Superman, having flashbacks to when he executed Zod years earlier, refused to believe that this man was actually him.\nOn the advice of theMartian Manhunter, Superman began to have therapy sessions with Dr.Claire Foster. With his therapist, he explored his fear of Zod and the danger he posed to his loved ones. Though he avoided confronting his enemy, nevertheless, he was called to action when he discovered Zod usingBizarroas a punching bag.[144]\nGeneral Zod finally initiated his ultimate plan against Superman - revealing that he somehow looked just like Clark. Zod transformed Earth's yellow sun into a red sun and specifically depowered the rest of Earth's heroes as well. Zod took over the US government, deposing President Luthor. With a common enemy, depowered Superman and President Luthor, as well as a slew of other depowered super villains, teamed up to defeat Zod.\nWhile Superman battled Zod, Luthor andMetallomanaged to return the sun to its proper color. Zod tried to get Superman to kill him again, but Superman refused. Zod was reckless in the fight and, as the sun turned yellow, accidentally killed himself in the fight, leaving Superman the victor.[145]\nSuperman later went to the future and battled a woman who pretended to be his daughter namedCir-El, who was actually an agent ofBrainiac 12. When Superman returned to the present, he had realized he had landed in an altered timeline.[146]\nSupermanand his supporting cast had theiroriginsrevisedin theSuperman: Birthrightseries written byMark Waidin2003. This rewrote the previous definitive origin story,John Byrne's1986mini-seriesThe Man of Steel, to include more elements from theSilver Agecharacter. It would remain in continuity untilInfinite Crisisin2006establishedGeoff Johns'Superman: Secret Origin.\nOne day, after being called out into space to helpGreen Lantern, Superman returned to find one million people missing from Earth — including Lois. Superman referred to this event as the \"Vanishing\". Tracing the catalyst to the Middle East, Superman found a city in the midst of a civil war, antagonized by a man namedGeneral Nox. Nox owned the machine responsible for the Vanishing and activated it again, causing himself and 3,000 more people to vanish.\nA man claiming to work for the government, Mr. Orr, demanded that Superman turn over the device, but Superman refused. The Man of Steel had realized that the Vanishing was caused by a device he originally created should anything ever happen to Earth — it created a \"perfect\" city inside a pocket of thePhantom Zoneand would teleport a portion of Earth's population there (including Lois). Superman discovered Earth's missing people safe and sound, besides the entire plot being a trap set by General Zod. Superman escaped Zod's attack and returned everyone back to Earth.\nAfter this, Superman built a new Fortress of Solitude in the Amazon Jungle.[147]\nClark resumed his normal job at the Daily Planet — but suffered a demotion, withJack Ryderas his replacement. Clark was angry at Lois, for she had known about it beforehand and did not tell him. Clark's new position involved him tracking Metropolis' special crimes unit, and Lois was assigned to do international reporting overseas.\nLois, caught in the crossfire\nWhile abroad covering the dangerous war in Umec, Lois and the squad she was with took fire from enemy combatants. In the crossfire, Lois was shot in the chest by an enemy sniper. Superman was there a moment later—to catch her as she fell and immediately flew her to the nearest medical encampment, where he waited while she underwent hours of surgery. Once Lois was stabilized, the JLA teleported her to theWatchtowerwhereDoctor Mid-Niteworked on her further. Clark stayed at his wife's side the entire duration. Lois survived and recovered at home for a couple of months, surrounded by friends and family.\nThe villainRuin, in a grand scheme against Clark, transformed a brother and sister into new versions of theParasite. The twins attacked Lois at home, and Superman borrowed a suit of armor fromSteelto confront the pair. Once the Parasites were dealt with, Superman learned Ruin's location and flew off alone to face him. Ruin managed to best Superman using red sunlight lamps to weaken him and escaped for a meeting with Lex Luthor, who told him to move to the next step of their plan.[148]\nRelationship drama developed between Clark and Lois and Lana Lang, when Lana admitted to Clark that she had decided to divorce their childhood friendPete Ross. Lana used the opportunity and tried to make Clark reconsider his own marriage because she was jealous of Lois. A feud between the two women broke out in the Kent residence in Smallville, and Ma Kent settled it by telling Lois not to take Clark for granted, and for Lana to back off.[149]\nWhile simultaneously investigating who Ruin was with Batman and Wonder Woman, Superman was contacted by his friend and Vice President of the United States Pete Ross, unaware that his wife wanted to divorce him. Pete requested Clark to speak to Lana due to her strange behavior. In the same series of messages, Lois contacted Clark and said they should consider having a baby.\nIn the meantime, Lex Luthor discovered an asteroid that turned out to be a piece of Superman's home planet, Krypton. Seeing that it was headed towards Earth, Luthor quickly pointed to Superman as the reason why the planet was at risk of destruction and declared Superman and Batman public enemies. He ordered many fellow heroes to apprehend the two, but this effort was unsuccessful. This failure pushed Luthor to insanity, and he decided to personally take on Superman. Thanks to the sacrifice of Captain Atom, the asteroid was successfully destroyed. Luthor revealed to Superman that his technology was supplied by Darkseid, but unbeknownst to him, he was being secretly recorded. This led to Luthor's impeachment and his disappearance, making Peter Ross the new President of the United States. The pieces of the destroyed asteroid fell to Earth, bringing with them thousands of pieces of kryptonite. Worried for his friend, Batman mobilized most of the heroes in the world to collect all the kryptonite they could find so that it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands while Superman was in lockdown.[150]\nClark talked to Lana again about stopping her divorce, but she had made up her mind. When Superman finally captured Ruin, he unmasked the villain to discover it was none other than - Pete Ross! Pete was taken to prison and beat up by other prisoners.\nClark went to talk to his friend alone and learned that Pete knew he was Superman (having learned the secret from Lex before it was wiped from his mind). Pete swore he was not the real Ruin and that he had been set up. Superman vowed to prove Pete's innocence, but, when the prison suddenly suffered a power outage, Pete Ross disappeared.[151]\nSuperman finds a long-lost family member\nAnother Kryptonian rocket fell to Earth similar to Clark's and was discovered by Batman who was on a mission to recover the few kryptonite pieces left by the asteroid. The pod's passenger was none other thanKara Zor-El, Superman's cousin.[152]Despite Batman's suspicions, Clark was thrilled to meet Kara and was determined to take her in. Nonetheless, Wonder Woman, after listening toHarbinger's troubling prophecies, took Kara to Themyscira to keep her safe and train her.[153]\nDiana's fears proved to be justified when Darkseid's troops invaded Paradise Island and kidnapped Kara.[154]Outraged, the trinity traveled to Apokolips where Darkseid has brainwashed Kara into becoming his newest Female Fury.[155]Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman forced Darkseid to give Kara back.[156]After a tough battle, Superman pinned Darkseid to the Source Wall to protect his cousin, and Kara officially took on the mantle of Supergirl.[2]\nMain article:Infinite Crisis\nMind-controlled Superman fights Wonder Woman\nSuperman discovered that Brainiac was mind controlling Lois — or so he thought. After a battle with Brainiac in the Fortress of Solitude, Superman was surprised to find human blood on his hands. The JLA and the JSA turned up, ordering Superman to surrender himself for what he had done.[157]Something was obviously wrong, because Superman tried to remember what happened but misremembered his battle with Brainiac as being with Darkseid. The JLA concluded that Superman was being manipulated by someone, because the person he had actually beaten in the Fortress of Solitude was Batman, now clinging to life.[158]\nThe League determined thatMaxwell Lordwas responsible for manipulating Superman using mind control. Just then, Lord controlled Superman to attack Wonder Woman, forcing Diana to fight for her life. Wonder Woman held her own, even stunning Superman at certain points, but even if she managed to win, Max Lord swore he would control Superman again, never stopping. In a quick decision, Diana snapped Max's neck — an event recorded by theBrother Eyesatellite and broadcasted around the world. Superman was freed — but at a terrible price.[159]\nIn Metropolis, the world was unsure of how to react to the tape of Wonder Woman killing Lord; even Superman had mixed emotions, becoming cold towards Diana. Lois supported Wonder Woman's decision, having deduced that when she was accidentally shot in Umec was probably actually an intentional hit placed on her by Lord.[160]\nSuperman discovered that theJustice League Watchtowerhad been destroyed, and the Justice League was in disarray. The League was on edge with each other after the events with Lord, with Batman saying the last time Superman inspired anything was when he died. With hurt feelings all around, the heroes parted ways indefinitely.\nWhen Superman returned to Metropolis, he foundMister Mxyzptlkin the form of an old man lying in the gutter. Mxyzptlk's magic was not working right, and the two teamed up to capture the realRuin, who had reappeared in Metropolis and whose identity was still unknown. Using all the clues, Clark finally realized that Ruin was in fact his good friend and science expertEmil Hamilton. Having solved the mystery, Superman battled Ruin once again, seemingly for the final time, as Hamilton held Pete Ross and Lana Lang captive. Though Hamilton prepared to sacrifice himself to destroy half of Metropolis with a bomb in his suit, Superman stopped him, brought him to justice, and fulfilled his promise to Pete Ross to find the man who framed him.[161]\nNew Earth Superman vs. Earth-Two Superman.\nAs the ongoing crisis continued, Superman heard a scream fromEarth-Two, and, flying there, found that Earth's Kal-L, standing over the body of Earth-Two Lois Lane, who had just died. Kal-L blamed Kal-El for her death and attacked him, leading to a brutal fight across the Earth-Two Metropolis. The fight was finally stopped whenWonder Womanarrived, grabbing Kal-L in her Lasso. She and Kal-El helped him see the truth—that Alexander Luthor was really pulling the strings.[162]\nAlexander Luthor, whose goal was to create the \"perfect universe\", had his plan halted because of a battle betweenSuperboyand the evilSuperboy-Prime. Superboy ultimately died from the fight before Superman could arrive, and the loss affected Clark deeply. Alexander's universe meddling disrupted history, causing some changes to Superman's past.\nSuperboy-Prime, driven totally insane by this point, decided the only solution was to destroy this universe completely by flying straight throughOaat lightspeed. In deep space,Guy Gardnerand a coalition of Green Lanterns managed to stop him long enough for Kal-El and Kal-L to grab him. The two Supermen flew him to Krypton's solar system—and straight through its red sun. Prime's powers were failing, but he still managed to beat Kal-L, fatally injuring him. Kal-El tore the S-shield off Prime's chest and knocked him out before collapsing. The Green Lanterns took the unconscious Superboy-Prime and arrested him. Kal-L died inPower Girl'sarms, and Kal-El was taken back to Earth, having lost his powers in the fight, at least hopeful that they had once again saved the universe.[163]\nAfter living a normal human life as Clark Kent for a year, having lost his powers against Superboy-Prime, Superman's powers suddenly came back. When he returned to action as the Man of Steel, the sorcererArioncame to Metropolis to implore Superman to stop fighting for the benefit of mankind, saying that he was disrupting the proper course of human history by pushing back an inevitable devastating event, and in the process, causing that event to be much worse, resulting in the end of civilization. This revelation troubled the Man of Steel and caused him to consider his place in the world.[164]\nAfter some time to think, Superman informed Arion of his choice to continue being a Superman. However, Arion cast a mind-control spell on Superman, planning to use him as a weapon against other alien heroes. But Superman managed to resist the spell and went after Arion, who began unleashing a massive disaster on the world. Phantom Stranger told Superman that Arion had unleashed the very disaster he was trying to prevent.[165]Superman found Arion's lair in the Atlantic Ocean, and after a lengthy fight, defeated Arion and handed him to the authorities.[166]\nMain article:Superman: Last Son\nAyoung boy, seemingly from Krypton, landed in Metropolis in a ship. Although initially the government worked with Superman on studying him, they later moved the boy without informing the Man of Steel. Angered, Clark hijacked the truck transporting the child and took him.[167]Lois and Clark decided to take the boy in as their son, naming him Christopher.[168]\nIt was discovered that Christopher was the son of Superman's enemyGeneral Zod, and, when Zod discovered his biological son preferred the parenting of Lois and Clark, Christopher sacrificed himself into the Phantom Zone to prevent his real father from attacking the Earth.[169][170]\nSuperman finally uncovers the truth about Brainiac.\nMain article:Superman: Brainiac\nOne day, having discovered a Brainiac drone outside of the Daily Planet, Superman learned from the robot that he had never truly fought Brainiac before, and all the earlier encounters Superman had ever had with the villain had been with one of his probes.[171]\nSuperman flew all through the galaxy in an attempt to track down the real Brainiac, but, during in his search, he was captured by the villain and brought aboutBrainiac's ship.[172]\nWhen Superman recovered, he finally was face to face with the true Brainiac, who had been studying, shrinking, bottling and collecting civilizations throughout the galaxy in his quest for knowledge.[173]Brainiac planned to bottle the Earth, but his invasion was stopped by Superman and Supergirl. Superman restored Metropolis and the stolen bottled city ofKandorto their normal sizes, with the latter being placed in the arctic away from civilization.\nHowever, Brainiac, though defeated, had one final trick left. After reading Superman's mind while he was kidnapped, he learned where Superman's parents live and fired a missile that exploded on the Kent farm. Although no one was hurt by the explosion itself, Jonathan Kent suffered a fatal heart attack and died, just as Clark arrived.[174]The loss was heavy, and a funeral was held soon after.[175]\nMain article:Final Crisis\nSuperman plays a major role during the Final Crisis\nBeginning another major crisis in the universe,Clayface, disguised as Jimmy Olsen, bombed the Daily Planet, severely injuring and killing several staff members and leaving Lois in critical condition.[176]As Lois was taken to the hospital, Clark managed to keep her heart beating with his heat vision.\nClark whispered that he would do anything to save his wife and was suddenly confronted byMonitor Zillo Valla, who insisted that Superman had to depart Earth immediately if he was to save his wife's life.[177]Zillo stopped time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, but warned him that while they should have all the time they would need, after time returned to normal Lois' heart would beat only once without Superman's help. Zillo promised a drop ofBleed, the extradimensional substance in which the Multiverse used to grow, to heal Lois should their mission succeed.\nExiting reality, Superman was introduced to his allies, fellow SupermenCaptain MarvelofEarth-5, the \"Quantum Superman\" ofEarth-4Captain Allen Adam, guilt-riddenOvermanof the Nazi-dominatedEarth-10, and hisantimattertwinUltraman. The group of supermen visitedLimbo, whereMerrymantook them to the Library of Limbo - its sole book containing infinite pages. Together, Superman and Captain Marvel were able to lift the infinite weight, allowing them to learn of the story of the Overmonitor, the all-encompassing megabeing in which the Multiverse grew, into which it sent the Monitors; its initial incursion into reality left a mark on creation in the form of a silent, titanic sentinel in the shape of Superman himself. In a backstabbing move, Ultraman stole the Infinite Book and its power for himself.[178]\nAs the drugs designed to dampen Captain Adam's quantum senses wore off, he realized what had to be done and combined the essences of positive Superman and negative Ultraman - the energy generated enough to 'broadcast' the resultant being to the higher dimension of Nil, home of the Monitors. In this heightened state, Superman discovered that the Monitors were a race of cosmic vampires feeding on the Bleed to sustain themselves and fought to defeat the Dark Monitor. Upon the villain's defeat, Superman found out that he had been tricked; it was impossible to contain or bottle Bleed to save his wife. Despite this, after splitting from Ultraman and returning to his Earth, Superman managed to distill a single drop of The Bleed anyway and administered it through a kiss to Lois, restoring her to full health.[179]\nAfterwards, Superman was transported to the 31st century by the Legion of Super-Heroes and informed thatSuperboy-Primehad returned to reality and was wreaking havoc in the future. After much deliberation, Superman and the Legion tried and failed to contain Superboy-Prime before realizing that everything been a plot orchestrated by theTime Trapperto destroy Superman. The teams then fought the Time Trapper, only to discover the Time Trapper was actually secretly a time-displaced Superboy-Prime.[180]Upon seeing what he would become, Superboy Prime panicked and punched his future self, erasing them both, and ending the conflict. Superman then returned back to his original time.[181]\nSuperman destroys Darkseid's essence.\nWhen Superman returned to the present, he found the world had been attacked by Darkseid in his absence, and, in a rage, attacked Darkseid's bunker. There, he found Batman's charred corpse.[182]Darkseid mocked Superman, saying he planned to take over all of existence, causing Superman to snap and almost kill him. Though he relented, Superman watched as Barry Allen - having been brought back from the dead - and Wally West lead the Black Racer to Darkseid to finally defeat him. As reality crumbled around him and the universe slowly died from the crisis, Superman, with the help of the rest of the remaining superheroes and humanity, constructed theMiracle Machineto undo all the damage. Darkseid's essence, unbound from his body, attempted to claim the Miracle Machine in a last-ditch effort, but Superman sang a note at a frequency that countered Darkseid's own vibrational frequency and shattered his essence.\nAt this point,Mandrakk, now in the form ofMonitor Rox Ogama, arrived alongside a now vampiric Ultraman to consume Superman, the last and greatest Protector of Life, at his weakest, explaining that Darkseid's fall, return and ultimate demise had worn the fabric of creation enough for him to invade it. To fight back, Superman used the remaining solar energy in his body to power the Miracle Machine, making a single wish. TheSupermen of the Multiverseappeared and fought back against Mandrakk and Ultraman, weakening Mandrakk enough for the Green Lanterns to break through and kill Mandrakk with a spike created from their rings.\nWith the crisis over and the multiverse rebuilding, Nix Uotan revealed that Superman's wish was for a happy ending.[183]\nMain article:Superman: New Krypton\nKryptonians return\nFollowing Superman's encounter with Brainiac, the entire city of Kandor now resided, back to its original size, near the Fortress of Solitude in the North Pole, populated by 100,000 Kryptonians. Although distracted by the recent death of his adoptive father Jonathan Kent, Superman attempted to aid the Kryptonians in their assimilation with the rest of the Earth—something very few Kryptonians seemed interested in, including the city's leaders, Zor-El and Alura, Supergirl's parents. After the first televised meeting between the President of the United States and a delegation from Kandor was interrupted by Doomsday,[184]Zor-El and Alura formed a task force determined to preemptively end any future threat to Kandor by capturing Superman's worst villains and trapping them in the Phantom Zone.\nHowever, despite good intentions, the plan went south, and several human police officers were killed by the Kryptonian task force when they refused to hand over the Parasite. In a plot orchestrated by Lex Luthor, General Sam Lane, Metallo and Reactron to stop the Kryptonian \"invasion\", Supergirl's father Zor-El was assassinated by Reactron during a siege on Kandor. His widow Alura denounced humanity in grief and anger.\nSuperman was caught in the middle of war - humanity demanding justice for the police officers, Kryptonians demanding justice for Zor-El - until the conflict ended with Kryptonian scientists using Brainiac's technology to lift Kandor off the Earth and grow an entirely new planet underneath it called \"New Krypton\" on the other side of the solar system, directly opposite the Earth and therefore hidden by the sun. For not directly siding with Krypton, Alura told Superman that he was not welcome on New Krypton, although Supergirl took up residence there with her mother. In the end, Alura freed General Zod from the Phantom Zone to help her lead their people.\nCommander ElwithUrsaandNon\nMain article:Superman: World of New Krypton\nSoon after, Superman accepted his auntAlura In-Ze'soffer to begin a new life on their planet in exchange for renouncing his life on Earth. Because of Superman's superior mastery over their Kryptonian abilities, he was drafted into theKryptonian Military Guildas a commander, working directly underneath his former enemyGeneral Zod.[185]Kal was placed in charge of theRed Shardtactical response unit.\nAn assassination attempt on General Zod's life forced Superman's investigation into the crime back to Earth, where Lois informed Clark that Zod's son and their adopted sonChris Kenthad returned to Earth.[186]Though Superman found the would-be assassin, the criminal was killed by General Sam Lane before Clark could get any answers.[187]\nKal-El was temporarily promoted toGeneralwith Zod out of commission, and the council discussed going to war based on revelations that the assassin Ral-Dar's weapon used against Zod was Earth-made. Zod returned to his position as a major conspiracy against New Krypton was being unraveled. Superman discovered the plot was orchestrated byGeneral LaneandSuperwoman, who believed that weakening New Krypton internally would preserve more lives because they believed an interplanetary war between them was inevitable.[188]\nMain article:Blackest Night\nInBlackest Night...\nClark temporarily left New Krypton to spend Thanksgiving with Martha, Conner and Krypto in Smallville. The dinner was interrupted by the zombified corpse ofKal-L, who had been transformed into aBlack Lantern, taking Jonathan Kent's coffin out of its grave. The villainNekronhad initiated theBlackest Night, bringing all of Earth's deceased beings back to life as evil Black Lanterns. The revived Black Lantern bodies of Kal-L,Earth-Two Lois LaneandPsycho-Pirateattacked the family, but Superman, Superboy and Krypto fought them off.[189]\nNekron, the leader of the Black Lantern Corps, arrived on Earth and, revealed he was behind the crisis and that he was responsible for Superman's return to life after his death at the hands of Doomsday. Because of this, Nekron was able to effortlessly transform Superman into a Black Lantern and induct him into his evil Corps.[190]\nHal Jordanfound theWhite Entity of Lifeand merged with it, gaining the necessary power to defeat Nekron. Hal resurrected Superman and inducted him into the newWhite Lantern Corps. With their combined power, the White Lanterns resurrectedBlack Hand, Nekron's link to the world of the living. Having lost his herald, Nekron was banished from the world of the living and the Blackest Night ended. The White Entity then disappeared, and Superman was returned to normal.[191]\nMain article:Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton\nBrainiac returns to re-bottle Kandor\nBrainiac returned and began invading New Krypton, forcing civilians to fight for their home. Zod activated the global defense cannons to fire on Brainiac's ship. Unfortunately, the blast did not even scratch the ship, but several Kryptonians were killed as collateral damage. Outraged, Kal-El called Zod out on his recklessness and lack of preparation, motivating him to quit the Military Guild and become Superman again.\nSuperman deduced how the shield around Brainiac's ship worked and was able to bypass it, infiltrating the ship. Once inside, Superman was knocked out by a Kryptonite laser fired by none other than Lex Luthor, who was working with Brainiac.[192]Upon awakening, the Man of Steel found himself strapped to a torture machine.Mon-Elcame to Superman's rescue, and together the heroes fought against Brainiac's robot army.[193][194]\nSuperman reconnected with the Legion of Super-Heroes, who had come back in time to New Krypton's aid. Despite their efforts, Brainiac managed to shrink and re-bottle the city ofKandor.[195]Upon returning to Brainiac's ship, Supergirl and Brainiac 5 succeeded in restoring Kandor to its original size, while Superman and Zod fought Brainiac head on. In all the commotion, one of Brainiac's stolen cities was enlarged while still inside Brainiac's ship.[196]The damage caused the ship to go on a collision course towards Kandor. Superman asked Mon-El and the Legionnaires to save the bottled cities while he, Superboy and Supergirl stopped the ship from crashing. The heroes were all successful, but Superman was left mortally wounded. With a blood transfusion from Superboy and a dose of synthesized, concentrated yellow sunlight from the 31st century, Brainiac 5 saved Superman's life.\nWith the battle won, Zod attempted to kill Brainiac, but Superman intervened, arguing that Brainiac should stand trial for his crimes. Despite this, Brainiac 5 grabbed Braniac and teleported away. Shortly afterwards, Superman and Supergirl discovered that Lex Luthor was never even present at Kandor; instead it was one of his robots.[197]\nSuperman fights Zod during the Hundred Minute War\nShortly after Brainiac's invasion had been stopped, Superman received news that General Zod had declared war on Earth. Outraged, Superman attempted to stop him but was held down by Ursa and Non. Zod revealed that, from the very beginning, he planned to invade Earth and allowed Superman to join the Military Guild so that the Man of Steel would unknowingly train his soldiers to use their powers. Superman argued that a war would mean the end of both Earth and New Krypton, but Zod started the attack anyway.[198]\nSuperman and Zod brought their fight to space, narrowly avoiding New Krypton's quick and spontaneously total destruction. Though Supergirl survived, her mother was not so lucky, leading Supergirl to angrily join the remaining Kryptonian forces' side in the war on Earth.[199]\nThough Superman and his cousin temporarily fight, Clark convinced Supergirl to calm down and understand the consequences of her actions while human lives were at stake as Zod's Kryptonian military invaded Earth and Mars. In a planetary defense move, Luthor and General Lane reverse engineered Kryptonian technology and used it to turn the sun red. With their powers gone, Superman, Supergirl and thousands of Kryptonians almost suffocated in space[200]had Thara Ak-Var not sacrificed herself to turn the sun back to yellow.[201]\nSuperman and Zod clashed in Metropolis, with Zod planning to terraform the Earth into anewNew Krypton. Just as Zod was about to kill Superman with a Kryptonite knife, Superboy, Krypto andLor-Zodjumped in to save him. Superman prepared to sacrifice himself and drag General Zod into the Phantom Zone to finally end the war, but Lor-Zod volunteered in his place, saying goodbye to his foster father Clark and ending his biological father's reign of terror.\nIn the aftermath, Superman and Lois reflected on the harsh pointlessness of the war that cost so many human and Kryptonian lives. In response, Lois promised to write the truth about her father Sam Lane's actions in the war, despite the media portraying him as a hero for his 'defensive action.' The couple were left wishing that maybe someday humanity would be ready for interaction with other alien races again.[202]\nTruth, Justice, and the American Way\nMain article:Superman: Grounded\nFollowing theHundred Minute War, Superman felt he had lost touch with humanity.[203]In an effort to get back to his roots as a hero and help people with their problems, Superman decided he would walk across the entire country on foot starting inPhiladelphia.[204]Passing throughDetroit, he used alien technology to solve the employment crisis and reopened factories.[205]The newBatmantracked him down and asked him to stop, believing that Clark was in the middle of an emotional breakdown, but Superman insisted the journey was something he needed to do. Superman was met with further criticism inOhiowhen a super-villain fight ravaged a small town, raising the question of whether he was to be held responsible.[206]\nWhile passing throughChicago, Clark was asked to leave because his mission seemed like a threat to the children. Despite this, Superman rescued a young boy from an abusive father and tried to reinforce that powers are not required to be a hero.[207]His morals were challenged again inIowa, whenLois Lanetried to shut down a environmentally unsafe factory that the local community depended upon. Forced to choose a side, Superman asked his wife not to publish the article because it would hurt too many people.[208]\nOn his travels, Superman met the newWonder Womanfor the first time, followingchanges to her history, and inspired her to become a hero.[209]Clark andThe Flashhad lunch inColoradoand discussed the idea of moral absolutes andheroic legacy, leaving Superman with a brighter outlook toward his own future.[210]The originalBatman, back from the dead, helped him further come to terms with his grief inUtah.[211]Following an attack byLivewireinLas Vegas, Superman tried his best to lighten the super-villain's prison sentence, explaining toJimmy Olsenthat America was the land of second chances, even for super-villains.[212]\nClark came to the conclusion that Superman, as an identity, was unnecessary and believed he could do more good if he began operating in secret again the way he did as a young man. In the middle of Clark writing an article officially condemning himself, anOregonman obsessed with Superman took him on a tour of the city to show him his value as a symbol by asking people on the streets.[213]\nThe villain that had secretly been plaguing Superman was revealed to beLisa Jennings, a woman who became the physical embodiment of Superman's depression and self-doubt through exposure to aKryptonian Sunstoneand had also received his powers. Superman disarmed her using his hope, having beaten his depression and decided to embrace his legacy. Givingsignal watchesto his closest allies, he formed theSupermen of AmericawithIron Munro,Livewire,Steel,Superboy,Super-ChiefandSupergirl. This team that embodied the values of \"Truth, Justice and the American way\" would eventually persevere into the future as theSuperman Squad.[214]\nMain article:Reign of Doomsday\nSuperman's final encounter with Lex Luthor.\nWhen Superman was warned that Doomsday was in Metropolis, the Man of Steel sped to the scene, only to be dragged into outer space by Lex Luthor, who had acquired godlike superpowers and planned to destroy Superman once and for all. Using his new superpowers to mentally torture Superman within his own mind, Luthor re-discovered that Superman was Clark Kent and that he had grown up with a very happy childhood with very loving parents. Luthor, furious with jealousy, attempted to finally kill Superman but learned that his new powers had the one flaw that wouldn't allow him to do that. Lex's powers subsided as well as his memory of who he was, and fell into the Phantom Zone, ending their conflict forever.\nSuperman reconnected with his friends on Luthor's spaceship after Lex's defeat and learned that, before he disappeared, Luthor had created multiple Doomsdays, all contained aboard his ship.[215]Upon this discorvery, the Superman family encountered theDoomslayer, a sentient Doomsday, who murdered theEradicatorwhen the artifact tried to subdue him.[216]\nSuperman vs. the Doomslayer.\nThe Doomslayer explained that his mission was to erase Doomsdays and all knowledge of them from the universe and attacked the original Doomsday with his laser vision. However, Superman defended the monster, saying that while Doomsday may be a mass murderer, the fact that the Doomslayer achieved sentience proved that Doomsday had the potential for redemption. The Doomslayer refused to listen and continued his plan to crash the ship into Earth and destroy it.\nSuperman, Steel, Supergirl and Superboy successfully stopped the ship from crash landing into Metropolis by aiming it into the bay and even reduced the damage of the tidal wave it caused. The Doomslayer, undefeated though, allied himself with four Doomsday clones and released them on the world to wreck havoc.[217]\nSuperman learned that the Eradicator had not actually been destroyed and, using the technology in Luthor's ship, had managed to overtake the original Doomsday's body and wanted to help stop the ensuing havoc. Superman, Steel, Superboy, Supergirl and the Eradicator successfully defeated and captured the rampaging Doomsdays that were set on the world, and the Eradicator sacrificed itself to teleport the Doomslayer far away from Earth, finally ending the threat.[218]\nMain article:Convergence\nLois and Clark have a baby boy\nAt some point, an alternate reality's future version ofBrainiacabducted Superman and Lois and thousands of others from their world and across the multiverse and put them on theBlood Moonto fight each other. The planet was controlled by the beingTelos, with all its inhabitants residing in a version of Gotham City surrounded by a dome that trapped everyone inside and caused all superhumans to lose their powers, including Clark.\nThree months after the dome's imprisonment, Clark impregnated Lois, and during the next nine months Clark fought crime in Gotham as a masked vigilante with Lois' help until the dome around Gotham disappeared and Clark regained his powers. With his powers back, Superman was attacked byCaptain Thunder,CyborgandAbin Sur, inhabitants froman alternate timeline.[219]\nWith Jimmy Olsen's help, Superman fought off the attackers until he discovered that Lois had been kidnapped by hisalternate timeline self. Superman defeated his doppelganger and rescued Lois just in time to deliver their son, who they namedJonathan Samuel Kentafter both of their fathers.[220]\nWhen the villainDeimosseized control of the Blood Moon, all of the collected heroes, including their original captor Telos, worked together to destroy Deimos, and his energy was scattered into the universe and began to tear reality apart. The only way to save the multiverse, according to Brainiac, was to go back in time and stop theFirst Crisis, and Superman, among others, accepted.\nThe group of heroes saved the multiverse,[221]after which Superman, Lois and their son Jonathan ultimately found themselves onEarth 09 years in the past. With their chance at a simpler life, Lois and Clark raised their child in anonymity.[222]\nSuperman and his family living on Prime Earth\nDespite living incognito, Superman never stopped working to protect the world, doing so in secret. He witnessed this new world'sJustice Leagueform after their first battle withDarkseid.[223]To further his activities, he constructed his own Fortress of Solitude, and, for the first time on this Earth, was forced out of secrecy to fight the villainBlanque.[224]\nLater, Superman saved the Excalibur, a space shuttle that carried Hank Henshaw, the man who became the Cyborg Superman back on his old world, and the two bonded.[223]After his family was temporarily kidnapped byIntergang, Clark told his son the truth of their origin and taught the boy how to use his half-Kryptonian powers to fly.[225]\nMain article:Superman: The Final Days of Superman\nAfter years in hiding, Clark finally met hisyounger Earth 0 counterpart, the current Superman of this world, who was dying from radiation poisoning. Their encounter was short, as they were attacked by Denny Swan, an ex-con who had acquired solar powers and wanted to become the world's only Superman.[226]Though the two Clarks worked together to defeat Swan and save the day, the younger Clark succumbed to his illness and died. Superman mourned his doppelganger's death, and, in his honor, officially came out of hiding and became Earth 0's new Superman.[227][228]\nMain article:DC Rebirth\nSuperman returns to action\nSuperman made his first public appearance by confrontingLex Luthor, who had assumed the \"Superman\" identity himself as his own way to honor the fallen hero. Though the two Supermen temporarily fought, they were interrupted by the appearance ofDoomsday, forcing Superman and Luthor to work together in taking the beast down, learning to share the mantle of Superman.[229]\n\nRebirth of the true Superman.\nDuring that time, Superman encountered a completely human Clark Kent, who claimed to be real Clark Kent and the younger Superman reborn. As the human Clark proved harmless, Superman decided to leave him to his own devices.[230]However, the human Clark burned down the Smith Farm where the Kents lived, kidnapped Jon[231]and revealed his real identity:Mr. Mxyzptlk. Mxyzptlk had brainwashed himself into thinking he was actually Clark Kent to escape from his captivity byMr. Ozand wanted revenge because Superman didn't even try to save him.[232]Mxyzptlk also revealed that both the New Earth and Prime Earth Supermen were actually two halves of one true, complete Superman, who was split into two separate people whenthe Flash originally altered the timeline.[233]The essences of both Supermen combined to save Jon and became a single, complete Superman, fixing their conflicting histories and bringing the world back to normal.[234]\nSuperman is commonly seen as a brave and kind-hearted hero with a strong sense of justice, morality and righteousness. He adheres to a strict moral code often attributed to the small-town American values with which he was raised, thanks to his adoptive parents. His commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many other heroes but has stirred resentment among others, who refer to him as the \"big blueboy scout.\" Superman can be rather rigid in this trait, causing tensions in the superhero community, notably with Wonder Woman (one of his closest friends) after she killedMaxwell Lord.[235]\nTo protect his secret identity, Superman has constructed a persona in his civilian identity as Clark Kent. To the world at large, Clark is a mild-mannered and clumsy person. Only Lois Lane, his wife, knows that this attitude is just an act.\nHaving lost his home world of Krypton, Superman is very protective of Earth, and especially of his family and friends. This same loss, combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite his many friends, his wife and his parents. Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians,Power Girl[236](who is, in fact, from the Krypton of theEarth-Twouniverse) andMon-El,[237]have led to disappointment. The arrival ofSupergirl, who has been confirmed to be not only from Krypton but also his cousin, has relieved this loneliness somewhat.[238]\nSuperman has worked with and fought alongside every hero in existence. As expected, though, only a few of them are real close to the Man of Steel.\nHeat Vision\n\nMain article:Superman Recommended Reading\n\nSuperman FamilymemberThis character is or was an incarnation of or an ally ofSuperman, and a member of theSuperman Family.

In his secret identity, he isBruce Wayne, a billionaire industrialist and notorious playboy. Although he has no superhuman powers, he is one of the world's smartest men and greatest fighters. His physical prowess and technical ingenuity make him an incredibly dangerous opponent. He is also a founding member of theJustice League of Americaand theOutsiders.\nMain article:Batman Origins\nWhen Bruce was four, he fell down the family well into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor, attracting the attention of several bats. His father eventually came to his rescue. These caves would later become the Batcave.[6]\nJoe ChillmurdersThomasandMartha Wayne\nAt the age of eight, Bruce and his parents, wealthy physicianDr. Thomas Wayneand his wifeMartha, were walking home from the Monarch Theater one night, when they were held up at gunpoint by a mugger who demanded the pearl necklace that Martha was wearing. When Dr. Wayne refused to surrender it, both he and Martha were shot dead in the streets.[7]The killer was a criminal known asJoe Chill.[8]Fortunately, physician and social workerLeslie Thompkinswas making a house call that night, and arrived to give loving comfort to the traumatized Bruce. He was then raised on theWayne Manorestate, with help from the wise and loyal butler,Alfred Pennyworth.[9]Bruce had very few friends during his childhood.\nBruce swore an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives. He spent his youth traveling the world, training himself to intellectual and physical perfection and learning a variety of crime-fighting skills, including chemistry, criminology, forensics, martial arts, gymnastics, disguise and escape artistry.\nAt age 14, Bruce Wayne began his global sojourn, attending courses at Cambridge, the Sorbonne, Berlin School of Science and other European universities, only taking subjects that suited him and his plan.[10]However, he never stayed long and would often drop out after one semester.[10]While abroad, he studied and received training in multiple martial art styles from various instructors in different countries. He learnt man-hunting from FrenchmanHenri Ducard,[11]stealth and reconnaissance under the Japanese ninjaKirigi[12]and other certified shinobi, hunting under the African Bushman (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-Eyed Brotherhood, among others), hand-to hand combat under the tutelage ofTed Grant, a world-champion boxer andDavid Cain, one of the world's premier assassins;[13][14]traditional healing disciplines under Nepalese monks and even ventriloquism under skilled practitioners.[10]Bruce also trained withChu Chin LiandTsunemotoin martial arts.[11]He was trained in kung fu byRichard Dragon.[15]He was also trained in archery byOliver Queen.[16]At the age of 17, Bruce was trained by detectiveHarvey Harristo improve his detective skills.[4]At age 20, he attempted to join the FBI, but after learning about its regulations and conduct, Wayne deducted that he would never be able to completely oppose crime while working within the legal system. The final mentor Bruce trained with was bounty hunterWillie Doggett, when Bruce and Willie were tracking a target, Willie was killed and Bruce managed to fight off the target by throwing him over a cliff, along with his parka. Luckily Bruce was rescued by a shaman and survived.[17]After this, Bruce returned to Gotham after twelve years of training at the age of 25.\nMain article:Batman: Year One\nBruce Wayne returned toGotham Cityafter many years of study and training with his body and mind developed to perfection. Despite having all of the skills and methods to fight crime, he still felt that there was something missing in the completion of his physical and mental arsenal. Wayne discovered the answer late one night while sitting in his manor. He recalled his fear of bats as a child after a large one crashed through one of the windows; he ultimately decided to make his appearance resemble a bat's. Wayne designed himself a costume equipped with experimental technology and set out against the crime and corruption that thrived in Gotham City.[7]\n\"Ladies. Gentlemen. You have eaten well.\"\nWayne's tactics to oppose crime as a vigilante at night proved successful leading him to become an urban legend in Gotham City. He revealed himself at a dinner of the most influential and corrupt figures in Gotham City and promised them all that their reigns on the city would eventually end. Wayne's first ally was Assistant District AttorneyHarvey Dent.[18]Most of theGotham City Police Departmentwas sent in force to capture him.[19]He gained his most powerful ally when he met Police LieutenantJames Gordon, one of the few honest cops on the force. The two developed a working relationship operating outside of the law when they needed to.[20]\nMain article:Batman Villains\nBatman's first fight against theJoker\nBatman's presence in Gotham City generated a new breed of criminals, no longer the simple thugs and gangsters involved inGotham Organized Crime, but moredynamic personalities. The first person inspired by him wasCatwoman, a dangerous seductress using his style and methods towards her own ends.[19]His next challenge wasDr. Hugo Strange, a mad scientist who had createdMonster Mento do his bidding.[21]He met his greatest nemesis when theJokerfirst appeared, a brilliant serial killer dressing like a clown and murdering people uncontrollably. He had been exposed to chemicals in an accident that drove him completely insane, and he swore revenge on Gotham for creating him. This confrontation led to the creation of theBat-Signal, a giant spotlight displayed in the sky whenever there is danger and Batman is needed.[22][23]There would be many more villains starting to appear within this time. TheScarecrowwas an outcast who developed techniques to strike terror into the hearts of his victims for his own pleasure.[24]TheRiddlerwas another deranged genius who felt a psychological compulsion to demonstrate his intellectual superiority, and constructed elaborate crimes while delivering clues daring law enforcement to catch him.[25]Poison Ivyattempted to destroy the city when an advanced connection to plant-life led her to wage a personal war against humanity.[26]The psychoticMister Freezeused dangerous experimental technology to take revenge against society when his wife died.[27]Another crime boss appeared named thePenguinwho acted as an eccentric criminal mastermind without any crippling mental illness other than a desire to prove himself. Many of these villains were kept inArkham Asylumfor the criminally insane.\nBatman,Harvey DentandJim Gordon\nMain article:Batman: The Long Halloween\nBatman and his trusted alliesJames GordonandHarvey Dentmet up on the rooftop ofpolice headquartersone night, and they swore that they would bring down theorganized crimesyndicates led byCarmine \"The Roman\" FalconeandSal Maronithat were completely controlling their town. Although it was necessary to bend the rules in their efforts, they agreed that they would never break them, and become as bad as the evil they fought against.[28]Meanwhile a serial killer namedHolidaybegan stalking prominent Mafiosos and shooting them dead. There was suspicion immediately cast on the three men in the triumvirate, and the possibility that it might be someone trying to remove their competition.[29]Gotham's new breed of criminals was replacing the traditional gangsters, and the underground was slowly being taken over bycostumed freakswith no respect for the old ways. Batman's presence was arguably the cause of this.[30]Amongst the killings Falcone's son Alberto was murdered.[31]Bruce Wayne went on his first date withSelina Kylearound this time, who flirted with him as Catwoman by night unaware of his alter-ego.[32]\nTwo-Faceand the \"costumed freaks\"\nIn his desperation, the Roman changed the game by employingsuper-villainsin his activities. Falcone and Maroni each believed the other was responsible for Holiday, and their gang wars tore Gotham apart.[33]Harvey Dent became a leading suspect because of his vindictive attitude towards criminals.[34]Bruce Wayne was also suspected of involvement with the Roman's organization and arrested.[35]His fatherThomas Waynehad reluctantly performed emergency surgery on a young Carmine Falcone for bullet wounds and indebted him, making him indirectly responsible for the Roman's empire. Bruce's trial proved his innocence thanks to the testimony ofAlfred Pennyworth.[36]Dent later admitted this was a mistake, and Maroni brought himself into custody with the intention of spilling his secrets before he was killed.[37]At the trial, Maroni smuggled in a bottle of acid and threw it at Dent's face during the prosecution, leaving him horribly disfigured. This also drove him insane, and he killed a doctor escaping from the hospital.[37]They arrived at the conclusion that Harvey Dent was Holiday, and Batman attempted to find him after he escaped. While Gordon was transporting the gangster to a different cell, Holiday appeared and shot Sal Maroni in the head, finally revealing his real identity...Alberto Falcone, having faked his own death.[38]Batman was disguised as the guard accompanying them, and he beat Holiday down before taking him into custody. Harvey Dent reappeared calling himselfTwo-Faceafter the nature of his personal tragedy, taking a team of villains into the Roman's private office. As the two leaders battled, Batman arrived and put most of the criminals down, but he was unable to stop Two-Face from shooting Carmine Falcone twice in the head. The three men, Batman, Gordon and Dent, had a final meeting on the rooftop of police headquarters. Dent was accused of betraying the things he believed in, but he insisted that his methods were the only ones that actually got rid of the Roman and he did what he needed to. He was then arrested, and although Batman and Gordon had seen one of the best men they knew completely broken, they still maintained that Gotham City could be saved and ridden of evil. Neither of them was willing to give up.[39]\nMain article:Justice League Origins\nThere are several stories of the first time Batman metSuperman, the greatest of his friends and allies. In the first version, Superman came to Gotham viewing Batman as a dangerous criminal and attempted to arrest him for his vigilante tactics. They were forced to work together tracking down the dangerous psychopathMagpieand Superman realized that although his own style of crime-fighting was suitable for his environment, the Bat-Man did what he needed to do to protect his city. They both gained respect for each other, although they doubted, they would ever work together again.[40]In another version, they both met as Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent while they were forced to share a room on a cruise ship. They are made aware of each other's secret identities when both are called upon to fight threats includingDeathstrokeand theCrime Syndicate.[41]\nInBatman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity, Clark later introduced him toWonder Womanwhile chasing \"The Purge\" led byRa's al Ghul. His methods however created tensions between them. He later rescued her fromBizarroand she fled toThemyscira. After finding her, he kissed her when he was overwhelmed by her beauty and the island's enchantments, leaving a memory which he kept fighting for, though he was decked by her in response. After being surprised by his gesture of retrieving herLasso of Truthand Superman stating that despite his methods, he was a brave man who fought for justice despite no powers, she came to see him as a complicated man. She also wondered about him acting alone, finding him obsessive. After defeating Ra's al Ghul and Bizarro, she came to see him as a loyal companion, though this contradicts her own comics where she first met both him and Superman during theLegendsevent.\nThere was a great team-up between many heroes to fight the alienAppellaxian invaders, including these three along withAquaman,The Flash,Green LanternandMartian Manhunter.[42]Eventually they would decide that they could better protect the planet if they permanently joined forces... and they became theJustice League of America.[43]\nDick Grayson's first appearance asRobin\nBruce Wayne was on an excursion to thecircuswhen he witnessed another tragedy that would shape his life. Theparentsof a young acrobat namedDick Graysonwere murdered by the gangsterTony Zucco.[44]He saw both great potential and something of himself in the boy that night. Although Bruce knew he could never replace Dick's father, he adopted Grayson as his legal ward to help him and provide guidance where he didn't have any when he was that age.[45][46]He eventually revealed his secret identity as Batman.[47]Dick wanted justice for his parents, and he agreed to a regiment of rigorous physical and mental training so that he could become Batman's partner.[48]After several months Dick was finally ready to take to the streets asRobin, fighting crime alongside his mentor.[49]They swore an oath late one night that they would fight together against crime and corruption, never swerving from the path of righteousness. Batman had realized for the first time that he did not have to be alone in his crusade.[50][51]\nBefore he could go into action regularly, Robin had to pass a final exam and he proved himself by taking down the gangsterJoe Minette.[52]Their first adventures as a dynamic duo were a remarkable change in tone, with Robin's lightheartedness alleviating the grim seriousness. Dick's first solo mission was stoppingMad Hatterin a sex trafficking ring while Bruce was indisposed.[53]Everything changed when Robin was targeted byTwo-Face. A double-gallows trap caused Robin to inadvertently cause the death of an innocent man, after which Two-Face beat him within an inch of his life using a baseball bat and made Batman watch.[54][55]Batman refused to let Robin go out with him anymore after the boy recovered because he didn't want to put him in further danger.[56]Dick had to prove again that he really wanted this life, demonstrating his competence and resolve.[57]\nRobin began teaming up with other young heroes and sidekicks, starting with a fight againstMr. Twisterwhere he worked alongsideAqualadandKid Flash.[58]SpeedyandWonder Girljoined them to fight an evil being namedAntithesiswho was mind controlling their mentors. This group decided to call themselves theTeen Titansand would go on to a long career with Robin as one of their core members.[59][60]As the leader of the Titans, Dick decided to give up his identity asRobin.[61]This happened after an incident where Bruce had fired Dick as his partner after Robin was shot off a rooftop by theJoker.[62]While he was doing some soul-searching, he met and talked withSupermanwho inspired him with a story about aKryptonianvigilante namedNightwing.[63]He reinvented himself using this new name and designing a newNightwingcostume, intending to honor all of the people who had shaped him into the man he had become.[64]\nThe debut ofBarbara GordonasBatgirl\nMain article:Batgirl Origins\nWhen Bruce was invited to the Million Dollar Masquerade Ball, Commissioner Gordon's daughter,Barbaracrashed the party in a female version of Batman's costume to surprise her father, who was also attending the event. At the party, before she revealed herself to Gordon,Killer Mothand his henchmen crashed the party, gunning for Bruce Wayne. James Gordon was taken out quickly, so Barbara decided to step in. Bruce Wayne was previously shoved out of the way by Barbara so that she could protect him and her unconscious adoptive father, thinking that Bruce was but a helpless bystander. She defeated Killer Moth, breaking a heel in the process. She was later namedBatgirlby Killer Moth, which stuck, even though she stated that she would have preferredBatwoman. Directly after the confrontation with Killer Moth, Batgirl met Batman and Robin. Batgirl's first encounter with Batman and Robin proved to be unpleasant. While she was angry with Batman's automatic dismissal of her capabilities, she was repulsed by Robin having a romantic interest in her.[65]Soon after that, Batgirl attempted to swing from rooftops, being saved by Robin, who told her that regular rope is not good for diving from forty feet in the air. Later, Robin sent Batgirl equipment, pretending that he believed in her and Batman didn't. In reality, Robin was sending them on the orders of Batman. She was later captured by Batman and Robin to be tested, an examination she failed in Batman's eyes, not being able to save the innocents in a holographic containment chamber.[66]Batgirl later teamed up withBlack Canary, her idol, and she finally gained some respect from Batman, while Robin still harbored a crush on her. She was introduced to James Gordon as Batgirl, one of Batman's protégés.[67]\nBatgirl's career came to an end after a few years, when the Joker shot and crippled her in an attempt to drive Commissioner Gordon insane. Although Batman eventually rescued Gordon and stopped the Joker, Barbara could never walk again.[68]However, she didn't let this adversity stop her and Barbara eventually resumed her career as a crime-fighter using the alias ofOracle, a computer expert and information broker who assisted heroes on their never ending crusade.[69]\nMain article:Batman: Tales of the Demon\nStruggling against theLeague of Assassins, Batman met the beautifulTalia al Ghulwhen he rescued her fromDoctor Darrk.[70]Ra's al Ghuldetermined his secret identity through logical deduction and confronted him after Talia had been kidnapped again alongsideRobin. Realizing that Ra's was behind this as a personal test, Batman confronted him and fought his bodyguardUbu. Ra's explained that he was making sure he had found a worthy successor in the detective, as Talia had fallen in love with him.[71]Batman eventually came to the conclusion that Ra's is a dangerous criminal who must be stopped at all costs and declared war on him.[72]\nMain article:Outsiders\nBatman quit the League when they refused to help him rescueLucius FoxfromBaron BedlaminMarkoviafor political reasons. Determining that he needed a new team more concerned with justice than the way they were viewed by the world, he created theOutsidersas a black ops super-team to go where the League couldn't. This team involvedBlack Lightning,Geo-Force,Halo,KatanaandMetamorpho.[73]\nMain article:Justice League International\nLegendssaw a new group of heroes form to fight againstG.

Shortly after this decision, Batman came across a young boy calledJason Todd, who had turned to crime out of necessity.[77]Batman tried to help him by placing him atMa Gunn's school, which was in fact a criminal hideout. Investigating Jason's background, Batman learned that the boy was an orphan. When Batman checked upon Jason, he realized the truth about the school and stopped the criminals with help from Jason, after which Batman took him under his wing and allowed him to become his new Robin.[78]\nWith Jason as the new Robin, the new Dynamic Duo stopped various criminals like Two-Face,[79][80]the Penguin,[81]Mime,[82]theCrime Doctor[83]andDeacon Blackfire.[84]Batman also worked together with Talia to stop the Penguin from spreading a lethal drug.[85]\nAround this time, Batman also confronted numerous threats on his own[86][87]and faced new criminals likeThe Ventriloquist,[88][89]The KGBeast,[90]The Ratcatcher,[91][92]The Corrosive ManandKadaver,[93][94]Cornelius Stirk[95][96]and the Dumpster Slasher.[97][98]\nThe death ofJason Todd\nMain article:Batman: A Death in the Family\nOver time, Batman realized Jason was behaving more aggressive towards criminals and this violence wound up being the cause of the death of a criminal.[99]When Jason became an inconvenience while fighting crime, Batman restricted him from going out as Robin.[100]In the meantime, Joker had escaped from Arkham and Batman followed the trail of the madman to the Middle East, where he also found Jason. Batman learned that Jason was looking for his real mother and when their missions crossed, they worked together to foil Joker's plans. Although they couldn't capture the Joker, Jason was reunited with his mother,Sheila Haywood. Unfortunately, she was being blackmailed by the Joker and the Dynamic Duo had to separate to deal with a double threat by the madman. While Batman went on to stop a deadly cargo ofJoker Venom, Robin tried to save his mother, but he was captured and beaten by the Joker.[101]\nBy the time Batman arrived at the crime scene, the warehouse where Jason and his mother were locked in exploded and Batman couldn't save either of them. After dealing with the funeral arrangements for them, Bruce returned to Gotham, where he tracked down the Joker to theUnited Nations Buildingand learned the madman had become an Ambassador, which granted him diplomatic immunity.[102]Batman was soon confronted by Superman, who was asked to prevent Batman from starting an international incident by attacking the Joker. Despite this, Batman continued his investigation and he confirmed Joker's involvement in Jason's death. Finally, when the Joker attempted to murder the people at the UN Building, he was stopped by Batman and Superman, but on his escape attempt, he fell to his apparent demise, but his body was not found.[103]\nTim Drake, The New Boy Wonder\nMain article:Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying\nAfter the death of Jason, Batman mourned his loss and became a loner for quite a while; stopping threats like the alieninvasion, Mr. Freeze,[104]the League of Assassins,[12]theBonecrusher,[11]Two-Face,[105]and solving other minor cases.[106][107][108][12][109]Batman also faced other strange incidents like the mysterious \"Batman Killings\",[110]the mystery of Tulpa, an ancient, dark and mystic ritual with help from the Demon,Etrigan,[111][112][113]the threat of theMud Pack, which resulted in the creation of theUltimate Clayface,[114]and finally he stopped the misguided vigilanteAnarky.[115][116]During one of his last acts as a loner, Batman was forced to take back Arkham Asylum from the many maniacs who had taken over the institution.[117]\nFollowing the death of Jason Todd, Batman became much more violent and aggressive while coping with the tragedy without someone to balance him out. A young man namedTim Drakefigured out his secret identity using detective work, and determined that he needed aRobinto keep his darkness in check, just asTwo-Facereappeared with new plans to kill the Dark Knight.[118]Drake beggedDick Graysonto go back to his identity as Robin again when he was needed most.[119]After explaining that he had deduced their identities by following Grayson's acrobatic career to Dick andAlfred Pennyworth, Tim was taken into theBatcavewhere it was suggested that he become the new Robin.[120]Batman and Nightwing tracked down Two-Face, and he caught them in his underground death-trap.[121]Tim took the Robin costume to rescue them and succeeded, although Batman argued that he no longer needed a side-kick. Begrudgingly, as he proved himself and helped them defeat Two-Face, Bruce agreed to start training Tim Drake and take him on as his new crime-fighting partner.[122]\nBatman (at the onset of a personal psychological mid-life crisis) was forced to deal, in rapid succession, with the returning villainBlack Maskand his gang (who targeted Bruce Wayne andLucius Fox),[123][124]a crazed killer calledMetalhead,[125]and a sharpshooter assassin hired by Vincent Morelli to murder Commissioner Gordon.[126]Batman began to feel he had lost his edge, especially after his failure to capture Black Mask. He found himself unable to meditate or even focus. As Bruce Wayne, he contacted holistic therapistShondra Kinsolvingfor treatment. He also assigned Tim Drake to trainJean-Paul Valleyin detective work to aid them as an ally, hoping he could prevent him from becoming a villainous threat.[127]Despite the advice of everyone in his life, including Dr. Kinsolving, Bruce refused to rest, and continued to pursue his self-imposed duty despite his worsening condition. Bruce's condition was worsened byThe Generalusurping power in Gotham's underworld and assaulting a police station,[128][129][130]Cypherattacking companies' CEOs[131][132]andThe Riddlercreating chaos in Gotham.[133]Meanwhile, Robin found it difficult to work with Jean-Paul, due to the man's violent subconscious training and lack of social skills, and also found himself being shut out from working alongside Batman.[134]\nMain article:Knightfall\nBane, a brilliant tactical mastermind who had trained his body to physical perfection, came to Gotham City and dedicated himself to destroying Batman and taking over his territory. This villain was more driven and powerful than anyone he had ever faced before and wanted to prove himself by defeating and breaking Batman. At their first meeting, Bane did not introduce himself but said that his name would eventually make him beg for mercy. Batman suggested that if he was threatening him, he should get in line behind everyone else.[135]\nBane began his assault by organizing a massive break-out atArkham Asylumwith the help of his henchmenBird,TroggandZombie.[136]Aware that he would lose in a direct assault against Batman, Bane's plan consisted of weakening Batman by forcing him to deal with the deadly villains simultaneously. Among the freed inmates, there were numerous high-profile villains, which Batman took down one by one. Batman faced against great criminals like Poison Ivy,[137]the Joker and the Scarecrow,[138]as well as many lesser known villains, such as the Mad Hatter,[139]The Ventriloquist,Amygdala,[140]Firefly,[141][142]Cavalier,[141]andMr. Zsasz.[143]The scenario created a rift in the relationship between Robin and Batman, as Batman irrationally sought to face the outbreak alone -- Robin later asked Batman if he was even needed as his sidekick anymore.[144]\nBanebreaks Batman's back\nBatman became weaker and weaker as each criminal was put away. The rescue ofMayor Krolfrom the combination of the Joker and Scarecrow took Batman to his mental and physical limit: a dose of Scarecrow's fear gas made him relive the murder of Jason Todd, which he considered to be his greatest failure.[145]\nAfter saving the Mayor, Batman was confronted by Trogg, Zombie and Bird and he took them out with the last amount of energy left in him.[146]Bane finally confronted him by breaking intoWayne Manorwhen Batman was at his weakest, beating him nearly to death in his weakened state and breaking his spine.[147]Bane took his body downtown to Gotham Square and threw it from a rooftop to demonstrate his superiority to the populace. With Batman incapacitated, Bane assumed control of Gotham City's underworld and took over several illegal operations within it.[148]\nAfter his defeat, Batman was rescued and his injuries were treated in the Batcave.[148]When Bruce woke up, he was moved upstairs to Wayne Manor and Alfred summoned Dr. Shondra Kinsolving to tend Bruce's injuries, telling her that they happened in a car crash. As the city was in need of Batman, Bruce asked Jean-Paul to fill in for him, much to Tim's dismay. Around this time, Bruce started to develop feelings for Shondra and considered revealing his secret to her.[149]Unfortunately, Shondra was kidnapped along withJack Drakeand Bruce couldn't stop the kidnappers, even though he tried.[150]\nBruce investigated the evidence left behind by the kidnappers and with Oracle's help, he tracked them to the island ofSanta Prisca. It was then that Bruce and Alfred started their quest to find Dr. Kinsolving and Jack Drake[151]and upon arriving at Santa Prisca, Bruce acknowledged his love for Shondra.[152]\nMain article:Batman: Knightquest\nOnce in Santa Prisca, Bruce was joined byBronze Tiger,GypsyandGreen Arrow; all temporary members of theJustice League Task Force.[153]Working together, they tried to rescue Shondra and Jack, but they failed and the hostages were moved out of the island.[154]\nBruce then tracked Shondra and Jack to London, as he learned about Shondra's connection toBenedict Asp.[155]Disguised as an old aristocrat, Bruce investigated Asp's residence[156]and failed to rescue Shondra, as he came to the wrong conclusion that she was criminally involved with Asp. Bruce managed to rescue Jack Drake but learned that Shondra was somehow involved in the murder of an entire village, and he swore to bring her to justice.[157]\nWhen his efforts to locate Shondra proved futile, Bruce dug into her past and managed to locate Shondra's foster mother, who revealed much about her past, before she was killed similarly to the people of the village.[158]Bruce and Alfred returned to Gotham, where Bruce was told by doctors to rest. Despite this, Bruce was compelled to track down Asp and Shondra, which caused Alfred's resignation due to Bruce's recklessness. Using the identity of Sir Hemingford Gray, Bruce forced Asp to come to him as the criminal kidnapped Bruce.[159]Asp took Bruce to his hideout, where he was reunited with Shondra and Bruce tried to rescue her, leading to a confrontation between Asp, Bruce and Shondra. Confused and still under the effects of drugs, Kinsolving tried to heal her brother, but instead she killed him. Filled with regret, Shondra used her powers to completely heal Bruce from his broken back. Unfortunately, the experience was too much for her mind and her psyche returned to that of a child permanently. Bruce Wayne bought a big residence, where Kinsolving could spend the rest of her days under the best medical care.[160]\nFinally, back in Gotham, Bruce learned of the disastrous effects of Jean-Paul's actions as Batman, and he decided to reclaim the mantle of the Bat. However, Bruce's physical condition was deteriorated after months of inactivity, and he decided to start an intensive training to confront Jean-Paul and take back the mantle of Batman.[161]\nMain article:Batman: KnightsEnd\nBruce Wayne wears theMask of Tengu\nIn order to regain his lost skills, Bruce sought help from the only master fighter he trusted: Lady Shiva. After weeks of rigorous training, Shiva wanted Bruce to learn a deadly technique, but when he refused, set a plan in motion in which Bruce would fight theDisciples of Armless Master, who was murdered by Shiva as she wore theMask of Tengu. Shiva then gave the mask to Bruce in order to lure the Disciples to him. Bruce confronted the first two Disciples and although they proved to be a great challenge, Bruce managed to defeat them, regaining some of his lost skills. However, he knew that it was not enough and he continued Shiva's trials.[162]Like this, Bruce defeated the rest of the Disciples and every match became much easier than the last one,[163]with minor exceptions in which luck was on Bruce's side.[164]\nOn the final confrontation, Bruce realized that Shiva wouldn't stop sending fighters his way to challenge him unless he used the deadly technique, she taught him.[165]In order to get rid of her, Bruce pretended to use the leopard blow and deceived her, officially ending his training. Knowing that he was finally ready, Bruce dons the Batsuit, marking the return of the real Batman.[166]\nTaking Nightwing and Robin along, Bruce tracked down Jean-Paul and confronted him in order to claim back his rightful position as Batman.[167]Jean-Paul put up a fight and the struggle attracted the attention of the authorities.\nBatman Returns\nAs the building they chose to battle was slowly consumed by the flames, they attached the Batrope to a nearby helicopter, which dragged them to the Gotham Bridge.[168]The fight continued over the bridge, where Bruce managed to get the upper hand and caused Jean-Paul's drop into the river. After saving the people on the chopper, Batman tried to use the Batmobile, but it exploded due to a trap prepared by Jean-Paul.[169]\nBruce avoided the explosion in the last minute and after talking to Robin, he went to Wayne Manor to challenge Jean-Paul for the last time.[170]Bruce tried to talk sense into Jean-Paul, but he wouldn't listen, and a confrontation started. Bruce managed to avoid violence and eventually forced Jean-Paul to remove his armor and admit his defeat. Bruce showed mercy at the end and allowed Jean-Paul to leave and start a new life while he continued with his own.[171]After this victory, Bruce decided to return to the role of Batman, even though it might not be absolutely permanent.[172]\nMain article:Zero Hour\nTheTimestreamwas damaged byExtantandParallaxworking together, causing time to deteriorate and reality to break down throughout history during theZero Hourcrisis.[173]A newBatgirlappeared from analternate timelinewhere she had never been crippled, and went on to get romantically involved with Bruce.[174]Alfredwas temporarily replaced with hisEarth-TwocounterpartAlfred Beagle.[175]There was another timeline he saw in which his parents were never killed byJoe Chill, and he wasted the time he could've spent with them tracking the mugger down anyway.[176]Batman was killed by an entropy fissure that opened right on top of him as the universe died.[177]The timeline was then rebooted at theBig Bangwith changes in history that caused slightdifferencesin Batman's continuity.[178]\nMain article:Batman: Prodigal\nBruce reaffirmed his partnership with Tim, resolving the tension caused by Bruce's unwillingness to accept help during the Arkham prison break. Bruce passed the mantle of Batman to Dick Grayson so he could re-evaluate what it would take to restore his perceived aura of invincibility.\nBecause of previous events, considerable time passed before Commissioner Gordon restored his trust in the idea of a Batman working for good. Gordon could tell that he was not looking at the original Batman (based on Jean-Paul's costume and Dick's height, and the fact that Jean-Paul was more than ready to kill people), and he refused to place blind trust in a costume after spending so long learning to trust the man. Numerous loose ends were tied up during this time, with Killer Croc, the Ventriloquist, Ratcatcher and Two-Face, along with many other, less notorious released inmates being returned to prison. During his time as Batman, Dick avenged his worst mistake from his days as Robin, when a mistake in a confrontation with Two-Face caused a man to die and nearly killed Bruce. He also came to appreciate the incredible physical and mental burden Bruce placed on himself in donning the Batsuit. During this time, a firm bond arose between Dick and Tim as they shared Wayne Manor together in Bruce and Alfred's absence.\nMain article:Batman: Troika\nWhen Bruce finally returned for good, he wore a sturdier (made of Kevlar), darker Batsuit and drove a new, state-of-the-art Batmobile. He again fought Colonel Vega, KGBeast andDark Rider, in order to foil a plot to nuke Gotham City with a device the size and shape of a baseball. Batman made changes to his life as Bruce Wayne, his relationships with his 'family', planned to live without Alfred, and coped with the decision of making Jean-Paul his replacement.\nMain article:Batman: Contagion\nShortly after Batman's comeback,Azraelsent him a video tape showing the effects of a deadly and highly contagious virus namedEbola Gulf-A.[179]Azrael told Batman that there would be an outbreak of the virus if he didn't stop it on time. The virus spread too fast among the citizens of Gotham, and it was impossible for Batman and his allies to find a cure or develop a serum from the survivors' blood. The \"clench\", as the virus was known, decimated the population of Gotham and even Tim Drake was infected. The city was quarantined, and the national guard was sent to control all of Gotham's access. It was later revealed that theOrder of St. Dumaswas responsible for creating the virus and for setting it free into the world.[180]Azrael, together withSister Lilhy, translated an old book from the Order of St. Dumas that contained the recipe to create a cure for the virus. Azrael delivered the cure to Gotham and the city was saved. The virus was under control, or at least it seemed that way.\nMain article:Batman: Legacy\nTheEbola Gulf-Avirus was not completely cured from those who were infected; it mutated into something more deadly. Batman sought Azrael's help on where to search for further information on the virus in order to develop a true cure. Batman's investigations lead him toSudanwhere he had to face two of his deadliest enemies.Ra's al Ghuljoined forces withBanein order to spread a new strain of the virus taken from the Wheel of Plagues.[181]Batman, Nightwing and Robin traveled around the world to prevent theLeague of Assassinsfrom spreading the virus in major cities likeParis,Edinburgh,Calcutta, andGotham City. Once in Gotham, Batman and Bane faced each other in a long-awaited rematch, but this time Batman defeated Bane and saved Gotham from the menace of Ra's' new virus. WithOracle's help, Batman managed to find a cure, although a great number of citizens had died from the mutated virus. Bane appeared sometime later with a new threat to Gotham: a nuclear weapon.[182]Batman, Nightwing and Robin successfully stopped Bane and restored Gotham's normal \"peace\".\nMain article:JLA: New World Order\nBrought together through a fight againstDoctor Destiny,Aquaman, Batman,Flash,Green Lantern,Martian Manhunter,SupermanandWonder Womanrealized that Earth needed its greatest heroes working together and reformed theJustice League of America.[183]Their first challenge was to prove themselves against a new superhero team called theHyperclanwho attempted to discredit them. Although the team were nearly overpowered by the Clan, Batman was able to outmaneuver the clan and expose their true identity as theWhite Martians, and the League stopped them from taking over the planet.[184]\nMain article:Batman: Cataclysm\nGotham Citywas completely destroyed by an earthquake that reached magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale. Batman was trapped inside of hiscaveat the time and was nearly killed by falling rocks.[185]The only properties that were not affected by the quake were those owned byWayne Enterprises, not includingWayne Manorfor geographic reasons.[186]With his car crushed, Bruce was forced to scuba through underground streams before getting to the harbor and seeing his city in flames.[187]Blackgate Prisonhad a break-out in the chaos, and Batman was able to put a stop to the rioting although many villains escaped in the process.[188]He enlisted thePenguin's influence on organized crime to incorporate local gangsters into the rescue efforts for survivors in the wreckage.[189]Teaming up with the GCPD he adopted the guise ofDetective Hawkeso he could drag people to safety in the daylight.[2]A new villain namedQuakemasterclaimed to have generated the disaster, and held the city hostage for several million dollars, threatening to hit them again if they did not comply.[190]In reality he had kidnapped seismologistJolene Relazzoand was using her knowledge to plausibly take credit.[191]Robinfigured out that Quakemaster was a fraud; in reality it had been theVentriloquist, and he was swiftly defeated. After the situation was stabilized, the body count had reached over one hundred thousand people. There were mass graves dug to burn the corpses and prevent spread of disease.[192]\nBruce Wayne was called upon as Gotham's top citizen to speak on their behalf in front of the United States Congress inWashington, applying for federal assistance. His main competition was the ruthless and corrupt Senator Barclay Means.Nicholas Scratchalso launched a smear campaign, attempting to convince America that the city wasn't worth saving.[193]Bruce's testimony was a great speech delivered from the heart about the spirit of Gotham, its importance and the strong will of its people in dealing with adversity and helping to make the nation great.[194]However, the negative sentiment was too great. There was not enough money in the federal budget, and they arrived at the conclusion that the negative elements would have to be isolated. Right before the ending of the trial,Mayor Grangewas gunned down by an assassin. Everyone still living within city limits was given 48 hours to leave, excluding anyone with known connections to the criminal element. After that the bridges leading inside were destroyed, and the national guard was stationed to make sure that no one else got in or got out.[195]Jeremiah Arkhamwas forced to release all the dangerously insanepatientsfromArkham Asyluminto the streets.[196]\nBatman duringNo Man's Land\nMain article:No Man's Land\nIn response, the U.S government declared Gotham a \"no man's land,\" destroyed all bridges leading to Gotham and forbade people from entering or exiting. The city was swiftly carved up by gangs and various supervillains Batman had battled over the years. Jim Gordon and several members of the Gotham police department stayed behind to protect civilians. Oracle andHuntressalso ended up on the inside. Bruce Wayne left the city to lobby the government not to cut Gotham off but failed. Gordon and his men waited for Batman's return, but by the time he returned more than three months later, they believed he had abandoned Gotham.\nHuntress attempted to keep order, fashioning a Batgirl costume. She soon discovered that criminals feared her more as Batgirl than they did Huntress and succeeded in holding territory of her own. When Batman returned, he allowed her to continue to use the costume. However, when she failed to hold off Two-Face and his army of men and lost Batman's territory, she abandoned the costume.\nBatman and James Gordon's officers worked separately to reclaim Gotham, piece by piece, by beating and subduing the gang leaders and then marking the reclaimed territory with graffiti. Poison Ivy took up residence inRobinson Parkand Batman allowed her to remain there as long as she cared for the local orphans and distributed food.\nGordon allied with Two-Face, but Two-Face betrayed their alliance. Two-Face also hired David Cain to kill Gordon, but Cain was thwarted by his daughterCassandra. Cassandra later took up the mantle as the third Batgirl to help clean up No Man's Land. Later, Two-Face kidnapped Gordon and put him on trial for breaking the alliance. Police officerRenee Montoyareached out to Two-Face's Harvey Dent persona, whose defense led to Gordon's acquittal. Dent's questioning concluded that Two-Face had essentially blackmailed Gordon into the alliance, hence making any alliance between them void.\nThe turning point for No Man's Land came whenLex Luthorarrived with helicopters to rebuild Gotham. However, Luthor's covert plan was to take the deeds and much of the property in Gotham, since the original deeds had been destroyed, and many of the owners had died in the earthquake. Lucius Fox discovered the original documents and notified Luthor. Luthor then attempted to kill Fox, but Batman intervened and told Luthor that Gotham was not for sale, warning him to leave.\nThe United States government reversed the No Man's Land order and allowed Gotham to rejoin the United States. Gordon and his surviving police officers were promoted. The Joker attacked police sergeantWilliam Pettit's compound, killing Pettit and leaving the Huntress badly injured. The Joker later kidnapped all of Gotham's babies. WhenSarah Essen-Gordondiscovered the babies, the Joker murdered her. Batman later convinced a grief-stricken Commissioner Gordon not to kill the Joker, who gloated at Gordon about murdering his wife. Gordon shot Joker through one of his kneecaps instead and let Batman take him away to be incarcerated.\nMain article:JLA: Tower of Babel\nRealizing how dangerously wrong things could go if any of his friends were mind controlled or manipulated into doing evil, Batman began to study their weaknesses and develop contingency plans to neutralize them.Talia al Ghulbroke into theBatcaveand stole the plans from theBatcomputer.[197]Ra's al Ghulbegan using these special methods to incapacitate every member of the League, while distracting the detective by stealing his parents' corpses. Ra's' plan was an attempt to thin the world's population using a machine that destroyed people's ability to process language worldwide.[198]Bursting into theLeague of Assassins' base to fight Ra's and prevent his parents from being lowered into aLazarus Pit, Batman realized that his plans had been stolen and warned everyone else.[199]Recovering from defeat, theJustice Leaguesaved their aggression towards Batman's controversial actions and fought back with help from a defecting Talia.[200]After saving the world, they voted to dismiss Batman from the League on grounds of distrust.[201]Superman eventually convinced him that he needed to regain the team's trust to be accepted again, and Batman returned by revealing his secret identity to the rest of his allies.[202]\nMain article:Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\nBruce Wayne and his bodyguardSasha Bordeauxwere framed for the murder of Bruce's girlfriend, radio talk show hostVesper Fairchild.[203]There was a trial and they were unable to defend themselves without revealing their secret identities.[204]Escaping from custody, Bruce determined that he would become Batman permanently and allow Bruce Wayne to disappear completely.[205]Eventually he realized that he was wrong to think he didn't benefit from the companies of his allies, and they proved his innocence by determining that the man who framed him wasDavid Cain.[206]\nMain article:Batman: Hush\nCatwomanproposes a kiss\nBruce Wayne realized that he was in the center of a malevolent shadow conspiracy targeting his life one night when hisbatlinewas cut in mid-air by a thrownbatarangand he barely survived the descent from the rooftops.[207]Tommy Elliot, his out-of-touch closest childhood friend who had grown into a skilled surgeon, repaired the damage and saved his life.[208]Soon afterward, the tires on theBatmobilewere shot out by a sniper during a mission that led to a dangerous crash. At the same time, Batman became romantically involved with the reformedCatwomanafter saving her life fromKiller Croc. They shared a passionate kiss together and gave into the feelings they had both been experiencing for years.[209]Having begun to open up emotionally again, Bruce reopened ties with his old friend Tommy and began working more closely with Catwoman in the field as a partner, teaming up with her to fightPoison Ivy.[210]Ivy mind-controlledSupermanand the two were forced to fight against the most powerful being on the planet. Batman was able to combat Superman's brute force by using superior tactics and hisGreen Kryptonite Ring. Catwoman kidnappedLois Laneand put her in mortal danger so Superman would be forced to break the hold and rescue her. After they caught Ivy by havingKryptotrack her down, Clark felt reassured that he had given the one weapon that could hurt him to the right person.[211]\nSupermanfights with Batman\nDuring an excursion to the opera that was interrupted byHarley Quinnstaging a robbery, Tommy Elliot appeared to be shot in the heart and killed by theJoker.[212]This drove Batman into a furious rage, and in his grief-stricken state he intended to beat the villain to death, thinking that he should have done many years before to prevent so much senseless tragedy. He was stopped only byCommissioner Gordonuntil his senses returned.[213]Harvey Dentreappeared in Gotham no longer insane, having gone through surgery to fix his face, and wanting to return to his former position as district attorney. Bruce took advice fromNightwingthat if he was truly going to pursue a meaningful relationship with Selina, he would need to open up to her, and to her surprise he made the decision to reveal his secret identity.[214]\nFurther investigation led him to suspectRa's al Ghulmight have answers about the unseen hand coordinating recent events, so Batman abducted his daughterTalia al Ghuland held her hostage. Besting Ra's in a swordfight only allowed him to learn that there had been recent unauthorized access to theLazarus Pitsand theLeague of Assassinswas desperate to kill whoever was responsible. Catwoman was almost killed byLady Shivawhile trying to stop her from rescuing Talia, meanwhile Batman acknowledged that the love he felt for Selina made it worth being emotionally vulnerable about her.[215]A fight againstScarecrowled him toGotham Cemeterywhere the mysterious man finally revealed himself to beJason Todd, a grown adult and apparently back from the dead, furious that Bruce had let him die.[216]After lengthy physical combat he realized he had been tricked byClayface. Consultation withOracleon surveillance equipment found in theBatcaverevealed that he had been betrayed by his former employee, mechanical geniusHarold Allnut. When he set up a meeting with Harold the man broke down in tears over his treachery, because he had been given happiness and expensive surgery that repaired his voice and freakish looks, making him finally normal. At that moment, two shots rang out and Harold was murdered.[217]\nHushreveals himself\nThe mysterious villain finally revealed himself asHush, Bruce's friend Tommy who had faked his death using Clayface and masterminded this elaborate scheme to take revenge on theWayne Familyin a personal vendetta. Hush would have killed Batman if not for the intervention of Gordon at the behest of Dent, formerly a co-conspirator, who betrayed Hush now that he had gone sane again. Tommy Elliot fell into the harbor and escaped before they could capture him. Batman realized that there must have been another mind pulling the strings and deduced that theRiddlerhad been working with Hush and manipulating the other villains the entire time. Riddler was the one who had broken into the Lazarus Pits to cure his cancer, and in the ensuing fit of madness he figured out that Batman was Bruce Wayne. However, a riddle that everyone knows the answer to is worthless, so his psychosis would not allow him to tell anyone else about it. Afterwards Batman also ended his romantic affair with Catwoman, realizing that he couldn't allow anyone to get that close to him in his line of work, but hoped that someday in the future he would be able to.[218]\nMain article:Batman: War Games\nTim Drakewas forced to give up his career asRobinwhen his fatherJack Drakediscovered his identity.[219]Stephanie Brown, formerly Spoiler, sought out the position and Batman agreed to take her on as his new Robin.[220]She was fired shortly afterwards for disobeying his orders during a fight withScarab.[221]\nTrying to impress Batman in the hopes of changing his mind, Spoiler activated one of his contingency plans to unite the entireGotham underworldunderMatches Malone, not realizing it was one of Bruce's other identities. The meeting between the big bosses turned bad and there was a shootout, creating a massive power vacuum in the city.[222]Black Maskended up taking control of organized crime throughout the entire city.[223]\nMain article:Batman: City of Crime\nBatman had to deal with a new wave of old and new criminals in Gotham, all alone.[224]One night, the death of a young girl named Haddie McNeil made Batman feel guilty and after capturing those responsible, a fire started atCrime Alley.[225]After saving the most people he could at the fire, Batman tried to relieve his guilt over Haddie's death by taking the case of a missing girl by the name of Cassie Welles.[226]On his quest to find this girl, Batman realized that there were many villains involved in the crime including the Penguin,[227]Mister Freeze, the Ventriloquist,[228]and a new threat: an army of men made of dirt. After this discovery, Batman tracked Freeze down and rescued a kidnapped girl from the psychopathic villain.[229]Shortly after, Batman investigated an attack on the Ventriloquist and later he learned of Cassie's death. In a quest to find the truth he investigated the body and discovered that it wasn't the real Cassie. The army of masked attackers struck again and they revealed themselves asThe Body. Batman was saved by the Penguin, who told Batman vital information about this new enemy.[230]\nBatman reached Crown Point and disguised himself as Donnie Maloy, a worker at the Waterfront Construction in order to learn the truth about The Body.[231]After a week of trying, Bruce managed to befriend the leader of Crown Point and head of workers. Investigating further, he discovered that something mysterious was happening at the nearest park.[232]After this, Bruce witnessed a madman become the source of a contagious fear.[233]After another unsuccessful attempt to enter the park, Bruce decided to act and took down the leader of Crown Point before calling Alfred and asking him to bring him the Batsuit. As Batman, Bruce was finally able to get inside the park.[234]In the park Batman learned the secrets of The Body and when he left the place, he was ready for a final battle.[235]Batman attacked The Body and led them to their own base of operations and there, he destroyed the place with a giant explosion, eliminating The Body as well. Batman found the killer of Cassie Welles, and everything was back to normal.[236]\nMain article:Batman: Under the Hood\nAs a result ofSuperboy-Primepunchingthe walls of reality during theInfinite Crisis,[237]Jason Toddwas resurrected as an amnesiac and crawled out of his own grave, eventually being taken in byTalia al Ghulwho restored his personality through aLazarus Pit. Distraught to find that Batman had not cared enough to avenge his death against theJoker, he took on the identity ofRed Hoodand vowed revenge.[238]\nBatman discovers thatJason Toddis theRed Hood\nRed Hood began terrorizing the Gotham underworld to enlistBlack Mask's soldiers into his own organization, allowing the drug trade to continue under his control with stricter restrictions.[239]Batman andNightwingmet him for the first time when he blew up a shipment of weapons on a boat they had taken down, chasing him until he released a stolenAmazoprototype to fight them.[240]Together they improvised and destroyed the android by taking out his individual components, while Red Hood used the distraction to steal another shipment containing several hundred pounds ofKryptonite.[241]Mister Freezewas sent to reclaim the merchandise and all four of them fought it out until the Red Hood left, saying this had been a ploy to get his lay of the land.[242]Batman began investigating the possibility that he was Jason in disguise, talking to his friends with knowledge of resurrection includingGreen Arrow,Jason BloodandZatanna.[243]Supermanhelped him confirm that it realistically could have happened. Red Hood teamed up withOnyx, although he betrayed her when she tried to stop the murder of several criminals.[244]\nJason Toddthreatens to kill theJoker\nDuring a climactic fight between the two men, Jason revealed himself to Bruce and explained his intention to change the face of crime-fighting. To prevent hundreds of unnecessary tragedies, he would bring death to those who deserve it.Alfredasked if the old Robin costume should be removed from theBatcave, but Bruce insisted that this didn't change anything at all.[245]Red Hood destroyed Black Mask's skyscraper headquarters with rockets, andDeathstrokeappeared to offer hisSecret Society of Super-Villains' services in killing Red Hood.[246]Captain Nazi,Count VertigoandHyenawere the hit squad sent to kill him, and Batman was deeply conflicted over whether or not he should save his former student. Bruce and Jason teamed up to defeat the three villains, but when they were done Jason murdered Captain Nazi and escaped.[247]\nBatman learned that Red Hood had captured the Joker and was holding him hostage, while Black Mask finally got into a massive fist-fight with the Hood over territory.[248]Bruce and Jason confronted each other inCrime Alley, where they witnessed another tragedy across the river.[249]Chemowas dropped as a living bomb ontoBludhavenby theBrotherhood of Evil, completely eradicating it.[250]They argued about the philosophy and morality behind the rule against killing, and Jason explained that he never blamed Bruce for failing to save him; he blamed him for letting the Joker live and continue to kill thousands of people. If their positions had been switched, Jason would not have hesitated to avenge him and put the madman down. Holding a final ultimatum, Jason gave Batman a gun and threatened to shoot the Joker unless he was lethally stopped. Having an emotional breakdown at this point, Batman ricocheted a batarang off the wall and hit his student in the neck non-fatally to save his enemy. Joker took this opportunity to grab the gun and shot the explosives inside the building, detonating a massive explosion.[251]\nBatman breaks down, pointing a gun atAlexander Luthor\nMain article:Infinite Crisis\nBatman became paranoid about the super-hero community ever since he found out that they had altered the minds of theSecret Society of Super-VillainsincludingDoctor LightandCatwomanas well as his own in the past.[252]He developed a sentient satellite calledBrother Eyeto help monitor them, using a database of every secret identity he was aware of. This system was stolen byMaxwell LordofCheckmate, who wanted to eliminate all super-humans by connecting it to theO.M.A.C.Project.[253]\nDuring theInfinite Crisis, Batman nearly killedAlexander Luthorafter the death ofSuperboyand Nightwing being almost beaten to death. He was however dissuaded from it by Diana, who stated that it wasn't worth it.[254]Regardless, the incident shook Batman's resolve, and he realized that he had crossed the line. It was time to re-evaluate his identity and retrace the steps that forged him into the man he had become.\nMain article:52\nBatman,NightwingandRobinwent across the world together following the path of Bruce's original training as a family. Seeking to rid himself of the paranoia and fear that had corrupted him, he had his personal demons cut out in a desert ritual performed by the Ten-Eyed Men. This broke him down and forced him to rebuild himself from the start.[255]Going through a spiritual purification ordeal called the 30 Days of Thögal inNanda Parbat, he spent a month alone in the darkness and looked deeply into his own soul through induced hallucinations.[256]\nMain article:Batman: Face the Face\nBatman and Robin returned to Gothamaftertheiryearof training, completely renewed and reinvigorated.Harvey Dentwas trained to fight crime in his stead and had become the city's resident vigilante protector.Commissioner Gordonturned on theBat-Signalagain and cheering broke out in the streets.Harvey Bullockbegan investigating a new serial killer taking out minor villains with two shots to the head, starting withKGBeastwho was found dead in an alley.[257]Poison Ivywas the first villain to appear again, holding new political motives that led her to attack corporate executives likeLucius Fox.Magpiewas also found dead.[258]Ventriloquistwas the next victim, alongside his puppetScarface. Batman decided that he needed someone working for him who could operate regularly during the daytime, and hired detectiveJason Bardpermanently on retainer.[259]Dent was the main suspect and grew enraged when he was accused, although Batman believed it was not really him.[260]Orcawas the next victim found dead in the sewers, where her corpse was mutilated by a hungryKiller Croc. The only connection was that all victims were former enforcers for thePenguin, who had recently fled town. Bard discovered the assassin was a newTally Manwhen he was attacked.[261]Driven back to insanity by internal conflict, Harvey Dent poured acid over one side of his face and reverted to his Two-Face persona.[262]Bard defeated the new Tally Man, and had him sent toArkham Asylum.[263]Batman was forced to take down Two-Face, who now blamed him for turning evil again.Great White Sharkwas revealed to be the mastermind behind the shootings, having taken over theunderworldand started running it for himself out of Arkham. Bruce also decided to adopt the recently orphaned Tim Drake legally as his son.[264]\nBatman meetsDamian Waynefor the first time\nMain article:Batman and Son\nHaving virtually eliminated all super-crime in Gotham with the energy from his recent vacation, Bruce went abroad.Alfredexplained that he had become so consumed by Batman he forgot how to act as Bruce Wayne, and needed to relearn.[265]At a charity function inLondonhe metJezebel Jet, an intelligent fashion model and ruler of an impoverished African nation whom he falls in love with immediately. TheLeague of Assassinsattacked Batman using a legion of ninjas transformed intoMan-Batsby a serum stolen fromKirk Langstrom.Talia al Ghultook him prisoner and revealed that they had a son together she never told him about, introducing him toDamian Wayne.[266]Bruce needed to take care of the child and teach him respect while he figured out Talia's plans, as Damian proved to be spoiled and petulant. Raised by the League, he was a master martial artist and proved extremely difficult to control, beating upTim Drakeand beheading theSpookto prove he could beRobin.[267]Batman agreed to let Damian fight at his side rather than leave him alone, with the understanding that he would follow their no killing rules and obey orders. Talia was inGibraltar, and they took theBat-Rocketto get there before she could follow through with her terrorist attack. This turned out to have been an elaborate ploy to bring them together as a family, in the hopes that Bruce would return to her so they could put an end to all crime by ruling the planet together. Batman refused, so she declared war on him, and they both disappeared during an explosion.[268]\nTheThree Ghosts of Batman\nMain article:Three Ghosts of Batman\nBat-Cop, a strange man dressed as Batman wielding guns, fought theJokerand shot him in the face before disappearing.[265]Joker believed the real Batman had changed the rules of their game, and was taken to the hospital where he psychologically transformed. Reinventing himself in a much darker and more brutal persona, he became an uncompromisingly malevolent creature of hatred.[269]\nJezebel Jetpursued a relationship with Bruce, sensing a deep connection between them. Looking into the mysterious disappearance of several prostitutes involving corruptGCPDofficers, Batman found they were trying to control and cover up a massiveBat-Baneonvenomandmonster men serum. Reminded of the other twisted impostor, he fought the huge foe and was pounded into the pavement.[270]After a nightmare promising that a third ghost from his past would yet haunt him, he recalled theBlack Casebook; a diary documenting all of the strange and bizarre adventures from his early career which couldn't be logically explained, including a similar situation.\nMichael LaneasBat-Devil\nBeating the Bat-Bane in their next fight, Batman was stopped from finding further answers by the corrupt officers and left him to be taken into custody.[271]\nBat-Devilmade his appearance by storming intoGCPD Headquartersdemanding the Commissioner, when he was woken up as a sleeper agent. Shooting Batman in the chest, he sent him into cardiac arrest and a near-death Bruce began to hallucinateBat-Mite.[272]Strapped into an operating chair in Bat-Devil's sanctum, he deliriously dreamed of his encounters withJoe Chilland having tormented him into committing suicide. This began flashbacks to his prior experiences with hallucination, including the 30 Days of Thögal[256]and the isolation chamber experiments conducted byDoctor Hurt.[273][8]The three men were revealed to have been part of an experiment that tried and failed to create another Batman in case of his death; it was conducted by Doctor Hurt, who was said to be the devil himself trying simply to destroy good men and make slaves of others. Batman broke free of his restraints and attacked Bat-Devil, who escaped as police arrived, and Bat-Bane was shot dead. Bruce considered the extreme hypothetical of an ultimate villain targeting his weaknesses through vast conspiracy unseen until it's too late and wondered if this adversary was showing itself to him.[274]\nThe Club of Heroes\nMain article:Batmen of All Nations\nMany years ago, Batman had been part of a club involving super-heroes inspired by his legend from around the world.[275]KnightandSquirefromEnglandwere legacy heroes after the originalKnight's death at the hands of his nemesis.The MusketeerfromFranceaccidentally killed an enemy and was sent to prison, then wrote a book about it. Sioux Indian heroMan-of-Batswas a doctor and had a strained relationship with his sidekick and sonRaven Red.WingmanfromSwedenrefused to admit his origins and claimed that he was crime-fighting a year before everyone else.El GauchoofArgentinahad become a greatly respected hero in his own right.The RangerfromAustraliahad developed a darker and more violent persona to keep up with the changing face of crime.LegionaryfromRomehad gotten way past his prime and lived in his glory days. They were all called together to a reunion at the island mansion of billionaireJohn Mayhew, although no one greeted them. A man appeared on video screen wearing Mayhew's severed face, challenging them to solve the mystery of his murder and save their own lives. They were fighting theBlack Glove, an organization that placed bets on the struggle between good and evil. Legionary was stabbed to death twenty-three times likeCaesarby an assailant.[276]Everyone was a suspect as the house turned into a giant death-trap, using methods common to all of their respective villains. Wingman was the next body found burned to death.[277]Ranger was discovered to be Wingman in disguise, having faked his death by switching bodies. Mayhew was still alive, and they were revealed to have worked together, taking revenge on Batman for ruining their chance at greatness by dismissing the team. After shooting Wingman in the head, Mayhew died when the Black Glove punished him for his failure and blew up the island as everyone else escaped in his plane.[278]\nMain article:Batman: Heart of Hush\nHushreappeared in Gotham to destroy his nemesis before theBlack Glovecould take his victory, establishing an abandoned hospital as his headquarters and filling it with loyal mental patients. ShootingDoctor Aesopunexpectedly during a fight, he promised Bruce that no other villain would be allowed to harm him.[279]Batman cautioned his allies to become paranoid, and Hush set his plans in motion, teaming up with theScarecrow.[280]A young orphan namedColin Wilkeswas pumped full ofvenomand set on a rampage to distract attention from Hush's main plot. Hush kidnappedCatwomanand surgically removed her heart, leaving her barely alive on life support.[281]The two men fought at the hospital, and Hush explained that he would shut off Catwoman's heart if attacked again. Then he revealed that he had undergone plastic surgery to look exactly identical to Bruce Wayne.[282]Their fight took them to theBatcaveafter Batman secured the heart withDoctor Mid-NiteandMister Terrific. Hush escaped permanent defeat after an explosion crippled him, although Catwoman used her resources to hunt down his entire fortune and destroy it, leaving him bankrupt. Bruce told Selina in her hospital bed that he loved her.[283]\nThe Batman ofZur-En-Arrh\nMain article:Batman R.I.P.\nDuring a dinner date where she considered breaking up with him,Jezebel Jetwas captured by a terrorist named the Fiend with Nine Eyes and discovered that Bruce was Batman when he rescued her.[284]\nTheBlack Gloveinvited Batman and Jezebel Jet to a dance of death called the Danse Macabre, having clearly discovered his secret identity.Doctor Hurthad organized villains and madmen from across the world including theJoker,Le Bossuand theClub of Villainsto finally put an end to Batman.Robinbelieved that Bruce was slowly starting to lose his grip on reality, althoughAlfredinsisted that there was no stronger mind in the world.[285]Hurt announced to his team that they would be creating a work of art in the complete and utter ruination of a noble human spirit;ThomasandMartha Waynewere discredited through slander published in theGotham Gazetteand the Club was sent out to attack hisallies. Bruce finally collapsed into a mental break-down when he heard the trigger phraseZur-En-Arrhspoken aloud, and villains stormed theBatcave[286]The attack completely destroyed his mind; he was injected with weapons grade crystal meth and street heroin and then woke up as an amnesiac derelict on the streets.\nA homeless man namedHonor Jacksontook him in and gave him a small radio he believed to be theBat-Radia, although this was a hallucination and Jackson had died of a drug overdose the previous day.Nightwingwas captured byScorpianaand taken toArkham Asylumwhere Bossu planned to lobotomize him.Pierrot LunaireandSwagmanwent after Robin. Bruce stitched a new costume called theBatman of Zur-En-ArrhwithBat-Miteas a spiritual guide.[287]This was a contingency plan he had prepared in case there was ever a direct attack on his mind, a stream-lined back-up personality that existed as Batman without Bruce Wayne. Taking out criminals across the city at unheard-of speed, he defeatedKing Krakenand interrogatedCharlie Caligula. Hurt began wearingThomas Wayne's Batman Costumeand claimed that he was the realThomas Wayne, having faked his own death years ago.Jeremiah Arkhamwas beaten and the Black Gloves took over his asylum.Commissioner Gordoncame to investigateWayne Manorpersonally and found himself caught in one ofEl Sombrero's death traps.[288]\nThe Black Glove prepared Arkham Asylum while its richest members gathered to gamble on whether good or evil would triumph. Batman fought his way inside through henchmen, although he had to make the final journey alone as Bat-Mite was his last voice of reason and could not enter the door.DamianandTalia al Ghulgot involved and rescued Gordon. Batman brutally fought the enraged Joker and then unmasked in front of him when he finally saved Jezebel, although she was revealed to have been part of the conspiracy all along.[289]Joker killed a member of the Glove and placed his bet on good triumphing over evil. Buried alive in his cowl to be raised from the grave after incurring brain damage, Batman woke up, broke out of his coffin and rose through the dirt. TheBat-Radiawas activated and it had been converted to send signals instead of receiving, putting the asylum into lock-down through theBatcomputer. Nightwing woke up in time to break his restraints and punch out Bossu seconds before his lobotomy. Robin brought theClub of Heroesin to help clean up the city. Hurt tried to escape in a helicopter driven byBat-Devilafter swearing to continue destroying Batman unless he submitted, but Bruce refused and took the chopper down with his bare hands. There was a massive explosion over the water, but Batman survived and continued his fight against evil.[290]\nThe death of Batman inFinal Crisis\nMain article:Final Crisis\nBatman had to solve the murder of aNew GodwhenOrionwas killed inMetropolisby aRadion Bullet. This was part of a greater plot byDarkseidto control theMultiverseusing theAnti-Life EquationduringFinal Crisis.[291]Libra, prophet of theReligion of Crime, killedMartian Manhunter. At the funeral, Batman paid his respects by placing aChocoon his departed friend's grave.[292]Investigating the killings, he was taken prisoner by another dark servant,Granny Goodnessposing asKrakenof theAlpha Lantern Corps.[293]\nBatman is killed by theOmega Sanction\nThey intended to use Bruce Wayne to create a clone army of Batmen, using his body and mind as the template for perfect soldiers.\nSimyanandMokkariheld him in theirEvil Factorywhere they sedated him and slowly drained his character. Recognizing what was happening to him, Batman broke his psyche out of telepathic restraints and fought back against the system. Making his own mind into a weapon, he used all of the pain and trauma he had experienced to destroy their machines. Every single memory that Batman had driving his motivations, all of the raw emotional energy, was more stress than anything else could tolerate and the entire complex destroyed itself and nearly everything inside.[294]\nBatman went to theCommand Dbunker and challengedDarkseid, the ultimate personification of evil, as the Anti-Life destroyed reality around them. Although he had made a very solemn vow about firearms, he said that he was making a once-in-a-lifetime exception and shot Darkseid in the chest with theRadion Bullet. This was a reversal of the moment when evil struck down his parents in the streets, and this time, Batman stood with his smoking gun pointed at evil himself. The last thing he said was \"gotcha.\" Right before dying, Darkseid blasted Batman with anOmega Sanctionthat seemingly killed him. Arriving moments too late,Supermanrecovered Batman's skeletal burnt corpse.[295]Bruce Wayne was shown to have survived the Omega Sanction, and his body had been flung backward thousands of years in time. He was trapped in thePrehistoric Era, where he was present for the death of the first manAnthroand drew cave paintings of his own insignia.[296]\nMain article:Batman: Battle for the Cowl\nNaturally, following the events of the Final Crisis that left the Batman Family without their leader, Batman's allies were in disarray, Gotham criminals took advantage of his absence, and the question stood, \"Is Batman gone?\" Feeling a combination of obligation and hesitation, Dick Grayson, Tim Drake-Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth and Damian Wayne debated as to what the future of the Dark Knight should be, until an estranged Jason Todd turned up, having taken a twisted cowl (reminiscent of Jean-Paul Valley's) for himself.[297]Todd decommissioned an arrogant Damian, making Dick, Tim and Alfred feel an even greater sense of urgency to send the Caped Crusader back on the streets. However, Dick still refused, prompting Tim to hijack an old Batsuit himself and seek out Jason and his twisted Batcave. Jason managed to defeat Tim and severely injure him, leaving only Dick and Jason as the heir to the cowl.[298]As Alfred provided medical care for Damian and Tim was barely escaping with his life, Dick and Jason fought long and hard until Jason, vowing that he would see Dick \"much sooner than you think,\" plummeted off of a moving train into the depths of the river below. The conclusion of this struggle found Dick accepting his role as the new Batman, with the darkest Robin yet, Damian, by his side.[299]Tim, however, was far away from Gotham, believing that Bruce was not actually dead. He took the mantle of the Red Robin and explored the globe for clues as to where his adoptive father was.[300]\nBatman returns as aBlack Lantern\nMain article:Blackest Night\nSuperman later returned the cowl from Bruce's remains to Nightwing and Robin, to be left in a memorial similar to the one Batman made for Jason. At Alfred's insistence, no public funeral was held for Batman, and Robin, refusing to believe he was dead, prevented them from declaring Bruce Wayne dead.[301]Wayne's body was buried in an unmarked grave next to Thomas and Martha Wayne.\nSome weeks later, as Gotham City was going through a rampant crime wave following Batman's disappearance,Green LanternHal JordanandBarry Allen, the secondFlash, who had returned during the Final Crisis, met each other at Wayne's grave for a private farewell to their friend. Although Hal was somber given the loss, coupled with the earlier losses ofArthur CurryandJ'onn J'onzz, Barry reminded Hal that they,SupermanandGreen Arrowall died and returned, and if anyone could beat the Reaper, it was the Dark Knight. Unfortunately, soon after they left, the criminalBlack Hand, dug Wayne's skull out of the ground while reciting theBlack LanternOath.[302]Nekronlater used a Black Lantern Ring to revive the skull and build it a form to tether an emotional connection to the heroes present, and had it spit out Black Lantern Rings that attached themselves to the resurrected heroes;[303]Superman,Wonder Woman, Green Arrow,SuperboyandKid Flash, with two more failing to reach Barry Allen and Hal Jordan.[304]Almost immediately after, much to Hal Jordan's surprise, Nekron released the skull from the ring, and it returned to normal. After the Blackest Night, Hal and Barry returned to Bruce's grave to talk about what had transpired. After stating that \"dead is dead from here on out,\" Hal said that Batman is the exception because the Black Lantern Batman they fought did not recognize any of them and was not really Bruce, proving that Tim Drake was right; Bruce was still alive, somewhere.[305]\nSometime after theBlackest Night, at Jason Todd's behest, Dick (apparently unaware of Hal Jordan's post-Blackest Night conclusions) immersed Bruce's body in aLazarus Pit.[306]The body turned out to be one of Darkseid'sBatman clonesthat he decided to keep as a perfect replica of Batman. However, its memories were warped and unstable and it went mad. After attackingDamian, the clone burned out and died. Dick finally accepted that Bruce was still alive somewhere.[307]\nBatman of thePrehistoric Era\nMain article:Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne\nTrapped in the past with no memory, Bruce was forced to fight his way through time back to the present day.Darkseidused theHyper-Adaptermonster to aim him like a doomsday weapon through history, picking up Omega Energy until he reached the modern era and exploded.Rip Hunterand hisTime Masters, includingBooster Gold,Green LanternandSupermanbecame a time traveling search party to stop him from ending the world. Starting in thePrehistoric Era, he was given the nameMan-of-Batsand defeatedVandal Savage'sBlood Tribein combat. This inspiration droveAnthro's people to call themselves theBat Tribe.[308]\nBruce Wayne asBlack Pirate\nSeveral hundred years later he became a colonial witch-hunter, using detective work to disprove supernatural explanations for local crimes using the identity ofMordecai Wayne. His name went down in legend as a mythical dragon-slayer when he disappeared while fighting the monster.[309]Bruce was mistaken for theBlack Piratewhen he washed up on an unfamiliar shore next to the real Jack Valor and was taken hostage byBlackbeard. They forced him to guide them through acave systemto reveal his treasure, but he fought them off with the Pirate's cowl and was assisted by the native Bat-people. Valor was entrusted to write down a mysterious message in a box, and gave it to the Wayne family for safe-keeping over the centuries.[310]As a masked avenger in the old west he protected his future family fromMonsieur Savageand another ancestor namedThomas Wayne, attempting to steal the box for themselves. This was supposed to bring about the end times through a dark god namedBarbatos. Succeeding in his mission, Batman was shot off a bridge by the bounty hunterJonah Hex.[311]Returning to Gotham shortly after his parents' murder, a friend of his mother named Marsha Lamarr enlisted him as a private investigator looking into the shooting. There were accusations made that Thomas Wayne staged the killing to fake his own death. Marsha betrayed Bruce toDoctor Hurt's devil-worshipingBlack Gloveorganization who had attempted to destroy his parents' souls through their reputations and set him on fire as a human sacrifice.Carter Nichols' prototype time machine allowed him to escape into the future, to the end of time atVanishing Point.[312]\nBatman affected by theHyper-Adapter\nBruce regained his memory at the end of time, having worked out his plan to thwart Darkseid's revenge. Memory loss gave the monster nothing to go on, and the clues he planted for himself all along helped him work out how to get through everything. Merging with one of the great Archivists, he briefly gained omniscience and created aTime Sphereto travel back to his own time though he was infected by the Hyper-Adapter. After coming back to the present, he easily took out every member ofJustice Leaguethat stood in his way. The only people he didn't harm were Tim and Diana, who used herLasso of Truthto make him regain his memories and remember his plan. The infestation however overtook him, and he started attacking her. The Time Masters soon arrived on the spot, and he ripped the Hyper-Adapter off of himself when others failed to do it. Superman, Diana and Hal trapped it in the Time Sphere on Bruce's advice, sending it back in time. He was then induced into a clinical death to dissipate the radiation while Clark and Diana tried to revive him. Experiencing a hallucination in theFifth World, Batman was confronted by a vision of Darkseid urging him to acceptAnti-LifeandMetronurging him to defeat the ultimate evil by accepting the first truth of Batman. Tim gave them his Batsuit and told them to inform him that Gotham was in trouble. Bruce then states the first truth of Batman: he was never alone. After he is revived and purged of the radiation, he suited up to go stating he won't be done until Gotham doesn't need him.[313]\nBruce Wayne goes public withBatman Inc.\nHowever, before going out as Batman again, Bruce took over the identity of the vigilante Insider and started meeting his past friends and allies to learn how things had changed since his departure. His return called the attention ofRa's al Ghuland after a confrontation in Gotham, Bruce decided that it was time to reclaim the mantle of the Bat.[314]\nDoctor HurtandProfessor Pyghad taken Gotham by siege, fightingDick GraysonandDamian Wayne. After defeating the 99 Fiends together, Bruce went after Hurt and the others went after Pyg. Trapping him in his own interrogation room to listen to Alfred's death, Hurt proclaimed that he was the devil and Batman wouldrotinpurgatory. Bursting out of the prison, he delivered a final beat-down to Hurt and went to rescue Pennyworth. The Doctor escaped outside where he was defeated by theJokerand buried alive with a giantgrinon his face. Having come to a new conclusion about the direction of his fight against crime, Bruce revealed in a press conference that he had been privately financing Batman for years and went public withBatman Incorporated.[315]\nThe redesignedBatman Incorporatedcostume\nMain article:Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes\nBatman gathered his closest associatesDick Grayson,Tim Drake,Barbara Gordon,Stephanie BrownandDamian Waynein theBatcaveand gave them all new assignments as the start of an army against crime. They would make their battle ideological, fighting the idea of crime with the idea of Batman and making sure there was nowhere for evil to hide.Lucius Foxwas commissioned to make a private army of Batman Robots. Bruce tried Damian out and determined that they would not work well together on missions, insisting that he continue his position with Grayson as the Batman and Robin of Gotham City. These actions drew the attentions of theLeviathan Organization.[316]\nBatman traveled toJapanwithCatwomanto recruit the crime-fighterMister Unknown.[317]They helped Mister Unknown defeat a Leviathan agent calledLord Death Man, and Mister Unknown became the new Batman of Japan.[318]InFrance, Bruce Wayne recruited a Muslim calledNightrunnerto become the Batman ofParis.[319][320]Batman visitedArgentinato recruitEl Gaucho. They battled Leviathan agentsEl Papagayo,El SombreroandScorpiana.[321][322]This trail led them to an island prison, where Leviathan had released the aging Nazi super-criminalDoctor Dedalus.[323]Bruce continued his expansion withBatwinginAfrica,Black BatinHong Kong,Dark RangerinAustralia,Red Robinin charge of theOutsiders, and a mysterious newWingman.[324]During a visit toSouth Dakota, Bruce helpedMan-of-BatsandRaven Reddeal with the Leviathan agent Red Rippa.[325]Bruce introduced Internet 3.0 to his investors, andOracledefended it against Leviathan cyber-attacks.[326]Batman andBatgirlwent undercover to take down an evilfinishing school. They stoppedSon of Pyg, who was using the school to recruit for Leviathan.Doctor Dedalustrapped the entire team in a labyrinth to drive them insane, until Robin was forced to kill Dedalus. It was revealed that Dedalus was just a distraction, and the mastermind by Leviathan wasTalia al Ghul.[327]\n\nTwo separate versions of Batman are taken to Convergence from Pre-Zero Hour, around the time when Jean Paul-Valley was still Batman and the Pre-Flashpoint Version. The villainBrainiacstole pre-Flashpoint Gotham City and pre-Zero Hour Metropolis and put them under the custody ofTelosthe Living Planet. The cities were surrounded by a dome that trapped everyone inside and caused all superhumans to lose their powers.\nPre-Zero Hour Batman and Valley team up to fight Tobias Whale. After the dome goes down and Whale is defeated, they fight theWetworks.[328][329]\nDuring the course of a year, Pre-Flashpoint Batman andRobinstruggled to maintain order. One night, Batman and Robin protectedPoison Ivy's garden, a source of good for Gotham, from the Penguin's minions, butRed Hood's arrival caused friction between the dynamic duo. Batman stopped the fight in time for the dome around Gotham to disappear. Telos announced that all of the cities he captured would fight among each other for survival, forcing Batman and his allies to confront theExtremists.[330]\nIt was only by setting their differences aside that Batman and his allies survived the confrontation and defeated their opponents. Bruce admitted to Damian that he did not know much about being a father, but he loved him and that was all that mattered. Damian understood and put the argument behind them both. Later, Batman re-metSuperman, who had also become a father by that time. The World's Finest acknowledged their responsibilities as fathers and decided to stand together, whatever happened.[331]\nAfter the fall of the dome, Bruce met analternate versionof his father, who had become his world's Batman. Their interaction was short, and Bruce and Thomas left to complete their respective missions, but not without saying kind words about one another.[332]\nWhen the evil sorcererDeimosannounced his plans to conquer Telos, Batman and his friends formed an alliance with other heroes on Telos to stop him. Deimos' death initiated a singularity that threatened to destroy the Multiverse, but a repentant Brainiac and a group of heroes were able to stop it by preventing theFirst Crisisfrom happening in the first place. Such an action restored the multiverse and released all of Telos' prisoners back into their respective homes, allowing Batman and his friends to resume their lives.[333]\nThe Batman\nBatman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and grim hero with a personal vendetta against criminals. Traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents from him. He is very paranoid and obsessive, which often makes it difficult for him to trust other people that aren't Alfred, the Robins, or the Batgirls.\nDespite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman's oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders.\nTo protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, superficial, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act.\nThe playboy billionaire aspect of his character is a facade, while the masked and particularly dark, grim vigilante is marked as the \"true\" man. Usually, Batman is separated from Bruce Wayne by the raspy and stony bass voice he usually assumes while costumed. However, although even Bruce considers Batman his 'real' identity, when he briefly contemplated abandoning Bruce Wayne to live only as Batman after the murder of Vesper Fairchild, his decision to act to protect a small-time thug from being caught in the crossfire helped him recognize that Bruce Wayne was equally important to him, as that action was based on what his father would have done. When Bruce and Batman were split into separate people by the wish-grantingId, Bruce retained the memory of Thomas and Martha Wayne's deaths, leaving him angry at the world with no way to channel that rage, while Batman began to gradually lose focus, lacking any actual drive to avenge deaths he no longer truly 'remembered' even if he still had his existing skills.\nAnother identity used by Batman is that of gangster \"Matches Malone.\" Matches was a small-time arsonist who killed his brother and then committed suicide by burning himself to death. Becoming Matches allows Batman to operate within the criminal community as a respected member with pre-established credibility. Matches is often under suspicion of being a snitch to Batman however, and great lengths often have to be gone to maintain his \"rep.\" Matches would later return to Gotham City, and reveal to Batman he had been innocent, and had faked his death. The real Matches was murdered by theVentriloquist, for Batman's actions in his name, but Batman was able to preserve the identity and even avenge his death.[334]He has since, when in the Malone persona, pursued it to the point of even being incarcerated as him inBlackgate Penitentiary.\nBruce Wayne at the Opera\nWayne guards his secret identity well, but several individuals have come to know of his superhero alter-ego, includingSuperman,Wonder Woman,Supergirl,Lois Lane, The Flash (Jay Garrick,Barry AllenandWally West), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan,John Stewart,Kyle RaynerandAlan Scott),Aquaman,Martian Manhunter,Plastic Man,Starman,Vixen,Zatanna Zatara,Black Lightning,Black Canary,Green Arrow,Arsenal,Nightwing,Catwoman,Red Hood,Red Robin,Oracle,Black Bat,Batgirl III,Robin V, his butlerAlfred Pennyworthand the kindly doctorLeslie Thompkins.\nSeveral villains have discovered his true identity over the years, most notablyRa's al Ghul,Hugo Strange, theRiddler, theScarecrowandBane.\nThe villainHushhas attempted to take revenge on both sides of the Batman/Bruce Wayne persona, and he is noted throughout his run as a villain who has personal ties to Bruce Wayne and/or Batman; Hush is later revealed to be Thomas Elliot, a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne. Fortunately, most of Batman's enemies have dismissed the notion of Bruce Wayne as Batman because of Wayne's apparent dim-wittedness and self-absorption while the ones who do know prefer to keep the information to themselves for their own reasons. TheJokerhas had opportunities to learn himself, but he has always refused them, since it would personally rob the mystique of his enemy.\nBatman is a normal human being who does not possess any superhuman abilities, but has character flaws that can be exploited by enemies.\nAs a young child, Bruce tended to be solitary and withdrawn, a condition only exacerbated by the murder of his parents. This led to his current state as a loner who would prefer to be on his own rather than rely on others. His difficulty in trusting others is a constant issue for him to overcome, and perhaps his only weakness.\nHis longest and closest relationship is withAlfred Pennyworth, who represents a father figure, confessor and advisor. Alfred and he have clashed in the past, but share a deep and unbreakable bond. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne looks like a rich, good looking, dim-witted playboy. But there are times when Bruce has found love -- the beautifulCatwoman,Wonder Woman,Talia al Ghul,Vicki Vale,Sasha Bordeaux,Zatannaand others, have all fallen in love with him. Bruce can love, it's just more difficult for him to after his parents' deaths.\nNext to Alfred, his closest relationships are with his partners and students, theRobinsand theBatgirls. Although they have not always been harmonious due to his nature as an often harsh, strict and emotionally withdrawn mentor, it is clear that he views the Robins as his sons, although he views Jason Todd as the son he failed.\nJames Gordonremains a close friend and staunch ally, although their relationship has also been challenged by Batman's secretive nature. Still, Gordon remains arguably Batman's best friend.\nHis relationship with other superheroes and metahumans has been complex. Though a long-time member of both theJustice Leagueand theOutsiders, and a close associate of theJustice Societyand theTeen Titans, he also does not fully trust them. This (warranted or not) has led to his keeping files on how to defeat allies and friends in case they ever cross the line. This stems from events revealed in theIdentity Crisisincident where his memory was erased by other members of the Justice League to cover up their roles in themindwipingofDoctor Light, who had rapedElongated Man's wifeSue. In the past, this information has been used against him and his allies, first byRa's al Ghul, and then later by theOMAC Project.\nBatman andSuperman\nAmong the superhero community outside the Robins and Batgirls, he is closest toSupermanandWonder Woman, having a long established partnership with both heroes, as well as a romantic, but mostly unexpressed, relationship with Wonder Woman. These relationships have never been smooth.\nSuperman and Batman have often disagreed with each other over methods and trust. A particularly sour point was the arrival ofKara Zor-El; Superman believed Batman was being unnecessarily cautious about a potentially dangerous Kara and Batman was shocked at Superman's willingness to reveal his secret identity to a girl with little actual memory ofKrypton. Despite their disagreements, the two hold a deep respect for each other, to the extent that Superman has trusted Batman with aKryptonite Ringto use against him in the event that the Man of Steel should fall under another's control, or simply turn against the world on his own. Though he may have never admitted it, he did love him as a friend. Batman viewed Clark as the most human of any of the people he had known, despite him being born on another planet.\nRegarding Diana, he originally thought of her as a magnet for trouble, even telling her not to come to Gotham. The two however developed a great respect for each other and their abilities. Diana recognized the inherent compassion, respect and does believe in his comrades, knowing that fear was only a tool of his and he hid his goodness behind a mask. Batman admired her for her hope of a just and better world, viewing her as one of the most good-hearted people he had known and also believed that she inspired anyone who met her.\nAmong all of the detectives in the super hero community, Batman appreciated Barry Allen's optimistic outlook; a man who saw his work as protecting the innocent, instead of damning the guilty.\nBatman has occasionally been arrogant, treating many of his allies with various degrees of disrespect. He often imposes his exacting standards on others as he does himself. He also sometimes overestimates his own abilities, allowing foes to take advantage of that. A major sour point in his relationship with others has been his secrecy and paranoia, including setting up surveillance on them and making plans to take them out should they ever become a danger. Batman however perceives his dishonesty and lack of complete trust as necessary.\nFor the most part, Bruce does not engage in serious romance, preferring to focus in his superhero duties instead. However, Bruce occasionally softens his heart and has been romantically involved with the following women:\nBatman andCatwomankiss\nBatman andTalia al Ghulembrace\nDiana kisses Bruce in her imagination, relieving her from theBlack Lantern Ring\n\nBatman bench pressing half a ton\n\n\nThis character is or was an incarnation of or an ally ofBatman, and a member of theBatman Family.

PeterFirst AppearanceWonder WomanVol 2  #1(February, 1987)\nPrincess Diana of Themyscira, also known asWonder Woman, is a founding member of theJustice League of Americaand one of the strongest female superheroes on the planet. She is a princess of theAmazonsofParadise Island, sculpted from clay byQueen Hippolytaand given life by theGods of Olympus. She is a champion of love, truth and peace, and uses her god-given powers to bring these values to Man's World.\nThe origin of Wonder Woman\nDiana is the daughter of QueenHippolyta, the first child born onParadise Islandin the three thousand year history that the immortalAmazonslived there. The Amazons had been created around 1200 B.C. when the Greek goddesses drew forth the souls of all women who had been murdered by men and placed them on the island. One soul was held back from creation, the one that would be born as Diana. That soul originally belonged to the unborn daughter of the first woman murdered by a man (whom Hippolyta was the reincarnation of). In the late 20th Century, Hippolyta was instructed to mold some clay from the shores of Paradise Island into the form of a baby girl. Six members of theGreek Pantheonthen bonded the soul to the clay, giving it life. Each of the six also granted Diana a gift:Demeter, great strength;Athena, wisdom and courage;Artemis, a hunter's heart and a communion with animals;Aphrodite, beauty and a loving heart;Hestia, sisterhood with fire;Hermes, speed and the power of flight. (It has been suggested that Diana isPandorareborn, who was also molded from the clay of the earth.[3]) Diana grew up surrounded by a legion of sisters and mothers. When she was a young woman, the gods decreed that the Amazons must send an emissary into Man's World, Diana who was bored of her surroundings and seeked adventure jumped at the opportunity to leave while following the mission to bring peace upon the world. Queen Hippolyta ordered a contest to be held, but forbade Diana from participating. Diana disobeyed and did so anyway in disguise, easily winning the contest and being named the Amazons' champion. She was given a uniform fashioned from the standard ofsomeonewho had visited the island a few decades earlier.[4]\nDiana did not keep her identity a secret, and she was not at first a \"super-heroine\". Indeed, her character was in many ways that of a babe in the woods, innocent and without guile. Diana spoke only Themyscirian, a combination of classical Greek and Turkish. She had to learn English when she arrived in America, rather than knowing the language intuitively. Nonetheless, Diana was trained as a warrior and had no compunction against using deadly force when called for. She often dealt with war, injustice, inequality, death, and conflicts involving the Olympian Gods.\nBefore embarking on her mission, Diana was given theLasso of Truth, forged byHephaestushimself. She was also given theSandals of Hermes, which allowed her to instantly traverse great distances in seconds. Diana's mission was one of peace, but part of it initially involved defeating a mad plot byAresto destroy the world. She ventured into the world by starting at Boston. There she met a Harvard professor, Dr.Julia Kapatelis, and her daughter,Vanessa Kapatelis, as well as the Air Force OfficersSteve TrevorandEtta Candy. Diana stayed with Julia and Vanessa and over the course of a month or two, she learned to speak English. She was attacked at their home byDecay, one of Ares' minions, and after a battle that spilled out into the streets of Boston she first came to the public's eye and was given the nameWonder Woman.Upon discovering Ares' plan (one that involved causing a nuclear holocaust), Diana managed to foil it, first battling his sonsPhobosandDeimosbefore finally convincing him the error of his ways using her Lasso. After defeating the God of War, Diana returned home for healing at the hands ofPoseidonhimself.[5]\nWonder Woman became a popular heroine and joined theJustice League of America. Her apprentice and pupilDonna Troy, thenWonder Girl, was a founding member of theTeen Titans. Diana, together withBatman,Superman,Flash, andAquaman, supported the teens and encouraged them to team up and work together with the Justice League.\nWonder Woman versus Ares\nAfter returning to Boston, Wonder Woman agreed to hireMyndi Mayerto be her publicist, with the aim of getting her image out to the world at large. She spent the next several months touring the world, conducting interviews and learning a lot about modern culture. She also initially met most of the Justice League including Batman and Superman around this time during theLegendsstoryline. After meeting Superman, she was initially discomforted by his attraction to her as she had never experienced such a thing before but found herself growing attracted to him over time.[6][7]\nWonder Woman gathered the attention ofBarbara Minerva, the Cheetah, who secretly desired to steal the Lasso of Truth from Diana. She lied to Wonder Woman about having found the lost Girdle of Antiope to get close to her, but after touching the Lasso her truth was made clear. Diana was frustrated and enraged over her naive trust of Minerva. That same night, Barbara decided to take the Lasso by force and attacked Wonder Woman as the Cheetah. Diana managed to fight her off, and decided it was time to return home to Paradise Island again.[8]\nChallenge of the Gods\nThe gods were pleased with Diana's work—one was a little too pleased, however.Zeusoffered to make Wonder Woman a goddess if she agreed to sleep with him. Diana refused, and Zeus decreed she must be punished for refusing his advances. The other gods managed to deflect the full brunt of Zeus's wrath. He decided that Wonder Woman must pass the Challenge of the Gods. He ordered her to go into the pits beneath Paradise Island and retrieve his fondest treasure, and Diana accepted the challenge. Hippolyta was not pleased, and though she could do nothing to stop Diana from descending into the depths, she did resolve to follow after her (fighting pastPhilippusfirst). Wonder Woman battled all number of evil monsters in the pits, from theHydrato theEchidnabut got some help from the spirit ofDiana Trevor. Diana Trevor, the mother of Steve Trevor, revealed that she had been an Air Force Pilot who crash landed on the island and then died helping the Amazons in battle. It was for her that Diana was named, and it was her standard that was used to fashion the Wonder Woman costume. Hippolyta caught up with her daughter, and together they fought even more mythological beasts until they discovered Zeus's treasure: his imprisoned demigod son,Heracles. The demigod had been changed to stone and made to bear the weight of the island for thousands of years for his actions against the Amazons. Diana and Hippolyta freed him and brought him back to the surface. Faced with his punishment of thousands of years, Heracles was repentant and begged forgiveness for what had happened between he and the Amazons. The Amazons forgave him at last, and after a celebration including a romantic reconciliation with Hippolyta, Heracles returned to Olympus. The gods were pleased with Diana. Hippolyta was pleased as well and ordered her daughter to return to Man's World and continue her mission.[9]\nOnce Wonder Woman was back, Myndi Mayer arranged a publicity stunt, this time at a fair. However, things took a negative turn when the firstSilver Swan, Valerie Beaudry, arrived on the scene. Wonder Woman battled the Swan along the coast but failed to capture her. Returning to Boston, Diana stayed with Vanessa while her mother was in Greece. Initially, when she had metSupermanalongside other heroes during theLegendsstoryline, was smitten by her and she felt uncomfortable as such things were new to her.[7]Though later she found herself distracted more and more with thoughts of Superman, eventually asking Myer to arrange a meeting between the two.[10]Diana and Superman had their \"date,\" which included a battle to free Olympus from the grip ofDarkseidafter he had laid waste to it. Superman and Wonder Woman decided it would be best if they just remained friends, but Superman trusted Diana enough with the secret of his dual identity.[11]\nThe emergence of Circe\nThe gods decided it was time to take a vacation (or \"Cosmic Migration\" as they called it) even as Diana decided to go with her friends to Greece, to see the ancient home of her people. She met Julia Kapetelis's parents but felt a strange sensation in regard to one of the smaller islands that was long said to have a bad history. As it turns out,Circemade that island her home, and she sent her minions to capture Diana and drag her back in chains. Circe revealed her whole history—including the fact that she murderedAntiope, Hippolyta's sister. Circe also revealed the prophecy she learned fromHecate, who was responsible for her power, and her belief that if either Circe or Diana kills the other then the spirit of Hecate will consume them. Circe resolved to use a spell that would degenerate Diana back in the clay from which she was created. Even with the help of her friends, Wonder Woman only carried the day with the timely intervention ofHermes, who had not yet left Olympus.[12]\nWhen Diana returned to Boston, she learned of the death of Myndi Mayer—someone had apparently shot her in the face with a shotgun in her own home. A man named Steve London was framed for the death, but Diana learned that the man responsible for killing her was a man namedSkeeter Boyd. Skeeter died trying to escape from Wonder Woman, grabbing hold of an electrified fence and frying himself. He had not, in fact, actually killed Myndi—an overdose of alcohol and cocaine had killed her before he delivered the blast. Diana was left to question how something like this could happen, ignorant of the effects of addiction and drug overdose.[13]\nCalled back to Paradise Island, Diana was summoned by the gods to come to Olympus with Hippolyta andMenalippe, which was still in ruins from Darkseid's rampage. The gods announced their decision to depart from the Earth, possibly forever, possibly not. They needed Diana's help to shatter what was left of Olympus so they could move on and allow the healing to begin. Their destiny now in their own hands, Diana called for a vote among the people whether or not they should open the gates of the island and allow men to come there. The Amazons voted yes, and Wonder Woman returned to Boston to invite Julia and Vanessa to be the first guests.[14]\nWonder Woman and her extended family\nDiana was shocked whenHermesshowed up in Boston. He explained that he believed the journey of the rest of the gods was folly and sought to assert himself, as a god, in Boston. He won a few converts through bribes and healing, despite Diana's protests. Hermes was tricked, however, byPhobosand the immortal gorgonEuryaleinto unleashingIxion the Assassinfrom his prison beneath the Earth. Ixion went on a rampage across Boston, killing hundreds and damaging the old U.S. Constitution. Hermes sent Diana a supernatural call for help, and she arrived just in time to confront Phobos, whom she bound with her Lasso. After attacking Ixion and flying him out of the city to prevent further death and destruction, Hermes managed to free himself and regain the Caudecus, the source of most of his godly power, and decapitated Eurayle. Meanwhile Ixion continued his battle with Diana, but even he proved to be no match for her superior strength. He told Diana about his thousands of years of torture and pleaded with her to kill him in order to end his suffering. Hermes then arrived on the scene with Phobos in tow, using his Caudecus to bind the monster, intending to imprison him once again. Phobos gloated to Diana that the only place Ixion could be properly imprisoned was beneath Themyscira. Diana was horrified, but before the matter could be resolved further, a squadron of jet fighters appeared on the scene. Seeing a chance to finally be freed of his suffering, Ixion broke free and charged the approaching planes, who then opened fire and killed him in response. Diana blamed herself for what happened, as she had not taken a stronger position against Hermes when he first arrived.[15]\nWonder Woman faces Cheetah\nCheetah decided to resurface, once again with the intention of stealing the Lasso of Truth. She used a pair ofKhunds, still on Earth after the invasion, to create a diversion so she could steal the Lasso. Suspecting that Dr. Barbara Minerva stole the lariat (but not knowing yet that she and Cheetah are one and the same) Wonder Woman traveled to Minerva's home in England (this coincided with a trip to the first meeting ofJustice League Europe, though Diana decided not to remain part of the team at this time). Minerva's manservant,Chuma, poisoned Diana and proceeded to tell her the whole story of how Minerva became Cheetah. The poison had no effect on Diana, however, and she tracked Cheetah to Egypt where out in the hidden city ofBana-Mighdallshe found thelost colony of Amazons. Their leader, QueenAnahid, incapacitated Diana with a poisonous dart and locked her away. The high priestess tried to kill Wonder Woman but died when Diana tossed her across the room, and she ended up swallowing the same poison dart Queen Anahid used on Diana earlier. Diana broke free and realized that Cheetah would be on the prowl that very night—but she was still groggy from the poison. The mercenary Amazons had been hired to pacify a nearby village. Armed for war, Wonder Woman fought them back and was attacked by Cheetah. After a vicious battle, Wonder Woman defeated her adversary and locked her up (Chuma was slain by gunfire during the fight). Queen Anahid, mortally injured by Cheetah during the battle, died after commanding that Diana be spared. The Amazons called off the raid and told her their history. They were indeed the descendants of Antiope, Hippolyta's sister, though they were not immortal. They had in their possession the otherGolden Girdle of Gaeaand were a nation of mercenaries and had been since Antiope's death.Phthia, blamingTheseusand all men for her mother's death, was their first leader. The city was then attacked by Hermes, who learned of and was enraged by the existence of the rogue Amazons and their possession of the Golden Girdle. Diana managed to convince him to cease his attack. One of the Amazons,Faruka, decided to use all the chaos to try and seize power, using an Amazon calledShim'tar. With Hermes weakened, Diana fought Shim'tar alone, battling to a standstill. The Egyptian government, outraged over the massacre at one of their villages, ordered an air strike on the hidden city. Not even Hermes was able to intervene, and the entire city was destroyed, leaving Wonder Woman, Cheetah, and Hermes alone in the desert. Wonder Woman recovered both her Lasso and the Golden Girdle. After a brief stop back in Boston, Diana returned the Girdle to her mother on Themyscira.[16]\nThemyscira and its visitors are manipulated by Eris\nThe time had come for Themyscira to welcome the world more openly. Twelve delegates were chosen: Asmund Lindel, the Norway delegate to the U.N.;Maritza Nitumbe, a South African botanist;Phyllis Haller, an American bestselling feminist author and sociologist;Vladimir Morakov, a Russian neurosurgeon;Robert Cantwell, a Scottish history teacher and war veteran;Rabbi Benjamin Hechtand Unitarian ministerReverand Alan Withersppon, the only two religious leaders to respond to Diana's invitation (the Vatican was silent);Lin Koo Teng, a survivor of theTiananmen Square massacre;Rovo Quashi, a blind man from Ethiopia;Henri Tibet, a paraplegic architect from Canada;Felix Zumac, a Haitian zoologist and anthropologist; andLois Lane, everybody's favorite reporter from the Daily Planet. Hermes, shedding his immortality, granted Diana the ability to use her winged sandals to take the delegates to Themyscira. The delegates all arrived to a magnificent greeting by the Amazons. No one suspected thatEris, daughter of Ares, was plotting discord. She nearly succeeded in turning everyone against one another, but her plans were discovered and thwarted. The delegates all delivered their favorable report to the U.N. while the Amazons commenced the cleanup. Julia was on a dig overseas and Vanessa was at summer camp. Hermes, shorn of some of his divinity, had been staying with Steve Trevor.[17]\nWonder Woman had her second run in with the Silver Swan, now more powerful than ever, when Valerie was attempting to escape from her \"benefactors.\" Wonder Woman andEtta Candywere captured byHenry Cobb Armbruster's thugs but working together they were able to break free. Using her Lasso on Armbruster, Diana was able to unveil the depth of his lies to Valerie. The Swan walked away, no longer the villain.[18]\nWonder Woman battles Mercury\nWith Themyscira known to the world and the gods departed from Earth, Queen Hippolyta decided it was indeed time to take a more active role. The Amazons removed theirbraceletsand decided to come to Man's World and see all that it had to offer.[19]Hipployta,Menalippe,Philippus, and other Amazons came to stay at a hotel inGotham City. Diana encountered Hermes again, who had rebuilt a temple unto himself and proceeded to flirt with Wonder Woman. This Hermes turned out to beMercury, and Wonder Woman had to help the true Hermes battle his \"evil twin\" at their temple. Mercury was able to win the battle, taunting the humbled Hermes as he departed the field. Hippolyta and the others decided they needed to present themselves as more than just an extension of Wonder Woman, and Steve Trevor told her that he needed some space as well, as Etta was growing jealous of the two of them. WhenVanessaalso got angry at Diana for being late to her birthday party and evenJuliawanted some space, Diana decided to return home to recharge. While at home, Diana was contacted in her sleep byHarmoniaas well asPariah, both of whom offered warnings about an impending crisis. After waking from this nightmare Diana seemed to drift into another one, involving a badly beaten and injured Hermes. Diana suspected thatCircewas behind her ill fortune lately.[20]\nBack in Boston, Wonder Woman encountered Hermes—who announced his intention to destroy Boston. Diana told him she would never let it be so—but from Hermes' point of view, it was the Amazon who was threatening the city. They began to battle one another, unaware that they were under the illusions ofDr. Psycho, who had been posing as a therapist for Vanessa. Diana and Hermes stopped short of killing one another when one of Vanessa's teachers interrupted the insane villain. Diana and Hermes, relieved of their delusions, joined together to track down their tormentor. Realizing that Psycho had been twisting the mind of Vanessa as well, Diana was able to connect her thoughts with Vanessa and track him down in his lair. There she found Vanessa's teacher, whose unborn baby had been tortured by Dr. Psycho as well. Meanwhile, the Amazons were attacked in their hotel by masked assassins, who also murdered the police officers at the building and framed it on the Amazons themselves. The word quickly spread, and by the time Wonder Woman had taken the injured teacher to the hospital, the police tried to arrest her for murder. Diana protested their innocence while alerting the police to the location of Dr. Psycho, whom she left tied up with her Lasso. However, when the police arrived, he was nowhere to be found; the Lasso was tied to a chair, but no one was there. Before the Boston P.D. took her in, Diana convinced them to allow her to help deliver the child, which she successfully did. A news report indicated that armed Amazons broke into the hotel in Gotham and slaughtered police and civilians alike.[21]\nWonder Woman allowed herself to be taken into custody where she learned the horrible tally: Hippolyta was missing, Philippus was gravely injured, Menalippe andEpionehad been arrested (the former with injuries),MnemosyneandTimandrahad been arrested in other cities,PythiaandEuboeawere unaccounted for, andHellenehad been killed. There was also an unidentified Amazon who was killed at the hotel, prompting a scare that there could be dozens of murderous Amazons on the loose. Vanessa came to the police station with news her mother was missing. Diana managed to convince the police to let her see the unidentified Amazon. The dead woman was unknown to her, but the tell-tale claw marks raking her body led her to believe she was killed by the Cheetah.Commissioner Gordonreluctantly ordered Diana arrested, but Diana, fearful for the safety of her friends, broke out of the jail. Recovering her Lasso, she freed Menalippe from her hospital before catching up with Pythia and Euboea and taking them all back to Paradise Island.[22]\nThe War of the Gods\nAt home, many of her Amazon sisters were crying out for vengeance, believing their queen to have been murdered. Diana asserted herself as the rightful leader of the Amazons, no matter what they decided to do. As they were debating, an oracle announced that the gods had returned. No sooner did she do so when Diana was summoned toMount Olympus.The godsannounced that something was terribly wrong with the order of things. They too had seenPariahand did not understand his importance. Zeus had expended much of his power just summoning Hermes from the Earth, and it had taken the combined energy of the rest of the pantheon to summon Diana there. They told her thatDonna Troyhad also turned up. Just then, a new set of gods emerged—it was theRoman pantheon, led byJupiterhimself. The Roman gods announced that they had a human champion that would battle against the Greeks' Wonder Woman—that champion was none other thanCaptain Marvel. Diana was forced to defend herself against a possessed Captain Marvel while Hermes and Mercury engaged in round two. Wonder Woman defeated Captain Marvel, while Circe began to unveil her master plan, unleashing chaos across the globe.[23]\nWhile Wonder Woman was on Olympus,Heraclestraveled to Paradise Island. Once there, earthquakes began to rock the island. Traveling beneath it, Heracles foundAtlaswith the island on his shoulders. This was the Roman Atlas, and he mistook Heracles forHercules. Back in the U.S., Mnemosyne, Timandra, and Epione were being transported by a military escort that was attacked by Amazons—but no Amazons the three prisoners recognized. These Amazons left a few survivors in the escort to tell the tale, then gassed the three prisoners and took them with them. Diana, after her victory over Captain Marvel, was transported back to Boston.[24]\nDiana ended up at the house of a police inspector,Edward Indelicato, whom she was friends with. She recounted her story and Edward agreed to help her. Diana, sensing thatCircetruly was to blame for all the madness going on, decided that she had to track downDoctor Fatefor assistance, who gave her a spell that made her invisible so she could return to Boston. The spell wore off when she (literally) ran into theSilver Swan, which was dumb luck as Valerie had been looking for Diana to give her some guidance. Diana had little to give, however, as distracted as she was by everything else going on.[25]\nA call toBlack Canaryput Diana in contact withBatman, whom she asked to retrieve the missing Themysciran goblet that she believed would help exonerate her people for the massacre in Gotham. Diana then banded together withZatanna,Phantom Stranger,Spectre,Doctor Fate,Flash (Wally West),Madame Xanadu, andGeo-Forceto try and undo the spells Circe had woven. Circe had expected this and planned on cultivating the energy from the spells the group was now casting—but her plan backfired, and her spells were undone: yet the war continued.[26]\nCirce had been betrayed by her allyKaslak. In addition to replacing the relics Circe needed for her spell, he also allowedPythiainto Circe's lair. Pythia managed to free her captured sisters as well asJulia Kapatelis. Wonder Woman met back up with Batman, who had recovered the Goblet, but told her that it was, in fact, a forgery that had been coated with some unknown material. Diana followed the trail back to Egypt, where she discovered the temple ofBana-Mighdallthat she thought had been destroyed. There she foundLobobattling Shim'tar. When some more Rogue Amazons arrived, Diana had Lobo fight them while she tackled Shim'tar, demanding to know what had become of her mother. After a tough battle, Diana managed to strike Shim'tar to the ground—only to unmask her and find that it was none other than Hippolyta.[27]\nNow the truth finally came together.Cheetahhad a confrontation with Edward Indelicato and explained the whole truth to him. While she had been in prison, Circe's minion Mikos came to her, transforming her permanently into the form of the Cheetah—although now, Minerva's mind remained fully in control. Circe was hardly benevolent, however, and insisted that Cheetah join herbeastiamorpharmy. Cheetah was to help Kaslak steal the proper artifacts for Circe to cast her spell. This included the Goblet, which Circle resolved to switch with a fake that would suit her own ends. She engaged the remnants of the Rogue Amazons, all part of a plot to discredit Diana and Themyscira. She also hiredDoctor Psychoto keep Diana distracted. When Hippolyta touched the fake goblet in Gotham, it transformed her into the new Shim'tar. Mikos removed Shim'tar from the building but failed to get the real goblet afterMaxie Zeus's assassins showed up, hired by Cheetah to try and double cross Circe. Philippus was attacked by one of the Rogue Amazons at the scene and witnessed Helene's death at the hands of the Cheetah.[28]\nTime was running out for Wonder Woman. She tracked down Hermes, but he was unable (or unwilling) to heal Hippolyta, so Diana resolved to take her mother back to Paradise Island. She was attacked en route by fighters, but with the help ofStarmanshe managed to evade them. On the shores of Paradise Island, she would face Circe at last. Circe had fought her way through Hermes to get to Diana, but she would not simply kill the Amazon and riskHecate'scurse. Cutting them off from other heroes gathered on the island (Starman,Hawkwoman,Aquaman, andDolphin), Circe used her magic to revert Diana back into the very same clay from which she was born. Having destroyed Wonder Woman, Circe departed, ready to grasp final victory. As the Amazons mourned their fallen princess,Supermanrallied Earth's heroes for the final battle.[29]\nDiana was not dead—not completely. Her soul was collected byPhantom Stranger,Spectre, andDeadman. They told her thatKlarion the Witch Boyhad been responsible for disrupting Circe's spells. Superman, meanwhile, led the charge against Olympus itself, where the confused Greek and Roman pantheons were still committed to destroying each other. When Circe's deceptions were made clear, she was transported back to the limbo realm where she had slain Hermes. There she foundDonna Troyand Wonder Woman—restored to life. Diana battled the evil witch, and this time her power was greater, for Hecate's power had left Circe. The witch was seemingly killed, but Hecate was denied Diana's soul. The gods decided to depart again, but the long war was finally over.[30]\nThe war had been costly. Much of Paradise Island was in ruins and would need to be rebuilt, and Menalippe and other Amazons had lost their lives. The United Nations, thankfully, fully exonerated Themyscira from all charges, and Queen Hippolyta was alive and well. Diana returned to the U.S. just in time to attend Vanessa's Junior High graduation.[31]\nWonder Woman is back\nWonder Woman was called to action bySupermanwhenBrainiacseized control ofWarworldand started to head for Earth. Superman decided that Earth could not wait for this invasion and had to launch a preemptive strike, so he recruited Diana and many of the world's other heroes.[32]WhileBatmangathered a team to defend Earth from any advanced warriors, Diana traveled with Superman and other heroes to Warworld to defeat Brainiac.[33]\nDiana spent some time withVanessaandJulia, until she learned fromEdward Indelicatothat theCheetahhad been captured in the Balkans, in a country calledPan Balgravia, by their new president, Baron Von Nastraed. Diana contacted the godProteusprior to leaving, enlisting his help to create a false identity,Diana Prince. Lacking knowledge of the region, she decided to enlistDeathstrokefor help. Inspector Indelicato decided to come along as well. The first location that they were led to turned out to be a trap and they had to fight their way through some royal guards. Capturing one, Wonder Woman used her Lasso to learn that the Baron had secret and dummy prisons set up all over—and he also had mass graves. Diana and Slade went undercover to the finest restaurant in the country, where they managed to meet the Baron and get him to agree to another meeting. On the way to the meeting, Deathstroke announced that he was parting ways, prompting a fight between he and Wonder Woman that she won. After tossing Deathstroke in the trunk of the car and having Indelicato stand guard, she broke into the Baron's castle. The Baron was not as naive as they hoped, however, and was waiting for her with several demonic thugs.[34]\nDeathstroke quickly recovered, however, and some of his \"friends\" showed up as backup. Wonder Woman was thrown in a magic cage but managed to force her way out.Barbara Minerva, reverted back to human form, was in the cell next to her, very weak from her long torment. She explained that the demon ruler needed a powerful female host for its mate. The Baron and his associate, Mr. Drax, began their demonic ritual as Deathstroke arrived on scene. As Wonder Woman fought the demon Drax, Deathstroke went after the Baron. Barbara, lapping up some spilled blood, reverted back into the Cheetah, and dove through the portal that Drax had opened, sealing it and destroying Drax in the process. The Baron vanished into thin air after Deathstroke plunged a dagger into him, and the nation was free again.[35]\nWonder Woman was prepared to testify at Indelicato's hearing, but no charges were filed against him. Outside the police station, Diana met a distraught woman who claimed her daughter had been kidnapped by her husband. The man in question got on the wrong side of some drug dealers who were shot and killed during a meeting he had with them, prompting him to grab a briefcase full of money (and his daughter) and run for it. The race was on to see if the police could catch up to him before mafiosi—but luckily, Diana made it there first, rescuing the little girl and preventing her from getting shot.[36]Meanwhile,Doctor Psychowas still on the prowl, and he used his powers to continue to torment Vanessa in her dreams.[37]\nWonder Woman in chains\nWonder Woman was approached by a man namedAsquith Randolph, the White Magician, for a mission that would take her into space, where she was needed to save the life of a female astronaut namedTashaon an experimental Russian spacecraft. When she was on board, Randolph detonated an explosive, and the ship was catapulted through space. Diana managed to get it under control, but they were still rocketing into the unknown. After drifting for two weeks through space, their ship was salvaged—but their rescuers were only interested in making them slaves. The slavers stripped them of their clothing and equipment and dropped them on a prison world—a prison world populated entirely by females calledHope's End. Tasha and Diana were bruised and battered—but not broken. They were prisoners on the planet for months, working in the quarries. AKhundprisoner frequently fought Diana. There was another prisoner, anunnamed Daxamite, who was kept in chains as a warning to the rest. After finally learning some of the other aliens' language, Diana learned their tormentors were called theSangteeand that they existed entirely as one gender for a century, then changed to the other. She finally managed to rally some of the other prisoners, destroying the Sangtee power station, capturing their starship, and freeing the imprisoned Daxamite. Taking up the role of a kind of space pirate, Diana worked hard, recruiting more ships and allies as she carved her way across the Sangtee Empire. One of her new friends created an artificial eye to replace one of the eyes the Daxamite lost. The new Daxamite was named Julia by Diana and she agreed to fight. Despite treachery from within, Diana was able to force a confrontation with the Sangtee emperor and get him (or her) to admit the folly of his people's ways. With some help from Julia, Diana finally was able to make it back home. Randolph had weaseled his way into the position of \"Hero of Boston\" during her absence.[38]\nWonder Woman after returning to Earth\nDiana did not return to Earth in time to prevent theDeath of Supermanor fightDoomsday. The monster tore throughJustice League Americabefore being put down by the Man of Steel—at the cost of Superman's own life. Diana gathered with past and present JLA members to mourn the death of their friend.[39]She held a place of honor during his funeral procession, and was one of the people who actually closed the lid on the sarcophagus.[40]Diana gathered with the Justice League at the Metropolis Post Office to read his fan mail as he used to every Christmas. While the heroes read some of them, she found a letter thanking him despite her house being destroyed by Doomsday, her husband divorcing, and she was financially ruined. Diana stated they should help her to repay Superman. She convinced her husband to take her back while Flash and Hal Jordan rebuilt her house.[41]The Justice League was in need of being rebuilt after Doomsday's rampage, so Wonder Woman agreed to come aboard as the new field leader.[42]\nDiana was shocked when she returned to Paradise Island to find it missing—the entire island was simply gone. Diana did not know what to make of it, so she went back to Boston and decided to get a job. Despite the fact that she was now leading the Justice League, and that she had apparently made a lot of money via merchandising thanks to Myndi Mayer, Diana resolved to look for a job in the classified ads. No one seemed interested in hiringWonder Woman. She eventually got a job atTaco Whiz, presumably so she could better understand the common man (and woman). She also got her own apartment.[43]\nDiana works at Taco Whiz\nDiana then met a man namedMicah Rainswho offered her a job (Rains was, according toEdward Indelicato, a total \"whackjob\") as a kind of P.I. TheWhite Magicianwas careful to always be close by, stealing the limelight. Diana continued her work at Taco Whiz while desperately trying to make a difference in some people's lives.Inza Cramer, the newDoctor Fate, finally reached Wonder Woman and offered her help at discovering what had happened to Themyscira. The two went back to the location of the former island, where Fate was able to use a spell to let them see events of the last few moments of the island. It seemed that a golden statue in Diana's likeness washed up on the shore. The Amazons brought it beforeHippolyta, but then something happened—a bright flash of light and an explosion—and the island was no more. Convinced her mother was dead, Diana knew thatCircemust be at fault. Doctor Fate was able to track her down, but when they arrived in Circe's lair, all they found were her remains—she was apparently killed in the same deadly spell she used to obliterate Paradise Island.[44]\nWonder Woman began to believe there was a connection between all the recent crimes that involved hi-tech gadgets. Diana began investigating. She also went out shopping withEtta Candyfor a wedding dress and after Etta passed out, she realized that her friend was starving herself to look thinner. While talking with Etta about it, theFlashshowed up, warning Diana about a hit on her and thatMayflywas the hitwoman. No sooner did he get out his warning when Mayfly showed up, guns blazing. With Etta and Flash's help, Diana managed to defeat Mayfly—but was shot in the process. While Diana recuperated in the hospital, Mayfly was murdered in her cell by an attorney named Donna Milton, who was working for Ares Buchanan, the supplier of the hi-tech arms and the one who hired Mayfly. Donna was carrying his child as well.[45]\nThe return of Ares\nDonna Milton then introduced herself to Diana, feeding her a tragic story of her life that caused Diana to remark \"nearly every terrible thing that can happen to a woman has happened to you.\" Diana was quickly taken in by the charming Donna. Ares Buchanan was, naturally, an avatar for the godAres, who was not so prepared to completely abandon the Earth. He had easily corrupted theWhite Magician, making him one of his lieutenants alongside Donna Milton. After weeks of friendship, Donna betrayed Wonder Woman to Ares. When Donna refused to let Ares torture her, however, he shot her and then prepared to shoot Diana. After a powerful spell from Ares, Diana was unable to break the chains that had bounded her. Donna, using one of Ares' weapons, created an explosion that left her and Diana plunging down hundreds of feet into a watery chamber beneath Ares' lair. The fall should have killed Donna, but they survived, and Donna went into labor. While Diana delivered the child, the White Magician contacted Ares's mafia boss, Sazia, letting him know that Ares Buchanan had died in the explosion, and they had to act quickly to hold his power together. Sazia was not interested, however, and attempted to shoot the Magician, so the Magician killed him instead.[46]\nThe White Magician, whose powers were increasing because of his connection to a demonic realm, began to transform some of his lackeys into supervillains. One of them,Dreadnaught, attacked Diana at the hospital—another attacked the Kapatelis' house, kidnappingVanessaand seriously cripplingJulia. Wonder Woman was able to save put a stop to the White Magician before more of his thugs could killEtta CandyandSteve Trevor. Her patience having run out, Diana contacted some of the mafia men connected to the Magician and warned them they had one hour to return Vanessa unharmed. When they failed to comply, Diana began to tear apart the gang, tracking down all of their outfits and demolishing them, leaving the words \"No quarter, no sanctuary\" as she went. Mrs. Sazia, the new head of the Sazia crime family, decided to betray the Magician to get Diana off their back. Diana found the Magician's lair and rescued Vanessa, but the Magician himself was not there.[47]\nCirce's manipulations are revealed\nDiana, plagued by nightmares, began to have doubt about her instability. She sought outSupermanand asked him to stop her if she ever got too out of control. Luckily,Doctor Fatereturned and told Diana that she had been having the same nightmares—dreams about the end of Themyscira. Replaying the spell that showed the end of the island, Diana guessed that maybe it hadn't really been destroyed—it was all a complex illusion created byCirce. Diana unveiled Doctor Fate, who was really Circe in disguise (or at least, an illusion of her). Circe revealed that she had not destroyed Paradise Island, but rather she had found a way to relocate it to a realm of fire where the Amazons had been fighting for their lives every day since their imprisonment. Circe offered to return the island—if Diana sacrificed an innocent life. She gave her until midnight. Battling through Circe's illusions, Diana was unable to save the life of a young runaway named Cynthia who was struck and killed by a car. With her death, however, Paradise Island was restored.[48]\nA contest to find a new Wonder Woman is announced\nDiana was elated—her home was back, her sisters were back, and her mother was back.Hippolytatold Diana the whole story of what had happened. Circe had led the renegadeAmazons of Bana-Mighdallto Paradise Island, stirring them up with dreams of conquest. They caught Hippolyta's Amazons completely off guard, and for two days there was nothing but bloody battle in the city. After it was too late, Circe's schemes became apparent. She used her magic to transport the entire island to another dimension, where the Amazons were set upon by demons. Both tribes of Amazons had to band together or die, and for ten years (in that realm) they fought against the demons. As a reward, Hippolyta bequeathed a section of the undeveloped part of the island to her sister's tribe. Now they were back, and the nightmare was over. Diana recounted everything she had done in the months since their absence—Hippolyta was not pleased. She felt Diana had wasted many opportunities to affect man's world as a whole. Hippolyta announced that she was not sure if she could trust Diana to represent the island anymore. Upset, Diana wandered away from the city with some friends, where she metArtemisfor the first time. Diana was intrigued, if not particularly impressed, with the brash, arrogant young Amazon from the tribe ofAntiope. As they were talking, word came that Hippolyta had made a decision—there would be a new contest, and perhaps a new Wonder Woman.[49]\nHippolyta meant to bar the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall from competing in the new contest, but she was overruled by a general vote among the Amazons. The Contest began, and Diana and Artemis quickly jumped out ahead. Artemis had to discipline one of her followers who tried to assassinate Diana during the middle of the Contest. Artemis did not think that anyone, but Diana could truly win, and that the Contest was merely a means of Hippolyta getting at her daughter, but she was determined to keep her honor. Hippolyta disclosed toPhilippusthat she had activated ancient magics, bringing to life monsters to battle the champions. Diana and Artemis were neck and neck during the last sprint—but distracted by seeing her mother ahead, Diana stumbled and fell. Artemis won the Contest—and the role ofWonder Woman.[50]\nArtemis, the New Wonder Woman, and Diana\nArtemis was given the Wonder Woman outfit to wear. She was also given theSandals of Hermes, which let her fly, and the Gauntlet of Atlas, which increased the strength of the wearer by a factor of ten. She also had her bow. Diana created a new black suit and headed back to Boston, too angry with her mother to listen to anything she had to say. Diana helped Artemis battle some minions of theWhite Magicianbefore visiting her friends in the hospital. Donna Milton was fully recovered, butJulia Kapateliswas paralyzed. Artemis went to New York City where a public relations firm picked her up, offering to make her a well-known presence. Artemis promised to succeed where Diana had failed. Diana had to help her friendMicah, who was in trouble again, before going off to helpHawkman.[51]Diana's teammates in theJustice Leaguedid not take kindly to the news that there was a new Wonder Woman. They refused to follow anyone other than Diana.[52]\nPoison Ivy and Cheshire attack Diana\nBoston was now caught in the middle of a gang war between the Sazia Family and the Paulie Longo family. Longo had the White Magician on his side, and all the beasts and creatures that came with him. Not to be outdone, Mrs. Sazia hiredCheshire,Poison Ivy, andCheetah. Diana was captured by the three villains. Cheetah, however, helped Diana escape, figuring she owed her one from their last encounter. Poison Ivy took out some of Longo's assassins that were coming for Sazia. The crime mistress was not safe, however, as theJokerhimself decided to come to Boston. Longo was displeased with the Magician's work, as it had failed to overwhelm Sazia. The Magician decided he needed to draw more power. Diana managed to track down Sazia and the Joker—who had a vest of dynamite strapped to him. The timer was a ruse, however, and it sprayed Diana with a paralyzing gel. Descending into the realm of the gods, Diana became one with the godPan, allowing her to shake off the paralysis and become (temporarily) almost as mad as the Joker and beat him at his own game. Meanwhile, Cheetah attacked the White Magician as he was preparing a spell to eliminate Sazia and Diana, causing him to miscast it and teleport them both away. Sazia managed to murder Longo before he got to her.[53]\nArtemis, frustrated and angry that the world had seemed to reject her, believed Diana was purposefully trying to disrupt her efforts as Wonder Woman. She tried to bring in Sazia, but the mob mistress evaded her. Diana, meanwhile, tracked down the Chauvinist and other thugs that Artemis had battled in her time as Wonder Woman. She discovered that they had all been hired by Artemis's agency, all for the sake of publicity, and managed to convince Artemis of this after a brief skirmish between the two. Diana decided she needed to go back home to get some answers from her mother.[54]\nDiana and Hippolyta have a falling out\nDiana found her mother in the woods, disciplining herself for what had happened between her and Diana. She confessed that when they were in the other realm, she had visions of the future—a future where Wonder Woman would die. This was the real reason she called for a new contest—a contest that she rigged, so that Artemis would win, become Wonder Woman and die while Diana would live. When Hippolyta said she expected Diana to remain with her while Artemis faced certain death back in Boston, an angry Diana responded, \"then you lost me a long time ago.\"[55]\nArtemis was in trouble—the White Magician was back but coming back from whatever realm he had gone to had changed him, transforming him into a powerful demon. He transformed Sazia and Cheetah into his minions and prepared for battle. As Artemis began a desperate struggle against the demon, Diana went first to the hospital. Her friends told her they thought she must have some kind of healing power—not only should Donna Milton and her baby have died in the explosion that killed Ares Buchanan, but Julia was almost completely recovered from her paralysis. Diana, however, realized the truth: Circe had been showing up, randomly attacking her before disappearing, with no rhyme or reason. Diana realized Circe had faked her death very well when she had gotten rid of Paradise Island—she had assumed another identity, Donna Milton, and hid her own mind so well in that other mind that maybe she did not even remember doing it. Diana interrogated Donna Milton, who denied this truth, not willing to accept it. But when Diana pressed her, Donna got angry and a spell teleported Diana to Artemis' side. The two Amazons fought together in a desperate, impossible fight against the White Magician, and his demonic pawns Cheetah and Sazia. When all seemed lost, Circe/Donna Milton appeared, and in a single burst of magic she disappeared, along with Cheetah and Sazia. Artemis, mortally wounded by the Magician, gave the Gauntlet of Atlas to Diana. With her strength thus amplified, Diana was able to put down the demon and then hold Artemis as she died. The two found peace in that last moment.[56]\nDiana is Wonder Woman once more\nDiana moved toGateway Cityto get a new start and began investigating some otherworldly technology—which led right toDarkseid, who captured Diana and brings her and a policeman namedMike SchorrtoApokolips. With the help ofMetron, Diana and Schorr escaped back to Earth. Diana learned that Darkseid was afterThemyscira. They got back after Darkseid had already invaded the island. Wonder Woman rallied her sisters to make a stand against Darkseid. The dark god called the battle off after a long hard fight. HisParademonscould be restored to life—the Amazons could not. Darkseid left the field, content with the damage done. Twelve hundred Amazons died, five hundred were injured. This meant that half the total population of Paradise Island had perished. Diana learned that her mother had left the island before the battle, stepping down as queen. Diana was offered the crown but declined and returned with Mike to Gateway.[57]\nIn Gateway, Diana got a job at a museum, working for the curatorHelena Sandsmark. She also met Helena's daughterCassandra. Cassie proved her penchant for getting into trouble early on, when she accidentally reactivated a golem that had to be put down. Diana was then approached by thePhantom Stranger, who needed her help to stop a recent plot byMorgaine le Fay. Morgaine was working withTheophilus Warlyand had captured theDemon(Jason Blood). She used her power to sick Etrigan on Diana, but Phantom Stranger managed to lift the spell and the three of them went after Morgaine in her lair. Next, she usedArion, enthralled by her spell, to attack them as they approached. Morgaine managed to capture them, and she hadVandal SavageandGeneral Immortusas well. Morgaine had planned on using their immortality to extend her own life and power, but Diana—having given up immortality upon leaving Themyscira—disrupted the spell. She battled Morgaine, who dissolved into dust.[58]\nA new hero calling himself Champion appeared in Gateway. Before Diana could meet him, she faced a new threat. When a scientist's young son was fatally injured in his lab, the scientist transferred the boy's mind into a computer system. Unfortunately, the boy thought he was actually playing a computer game and used his father's hard synthoid technology to create recreations ofBarry Allen,Sinestro, andDoomsdaywho all ran amok in Gateway. Champion joined the fray to help Diana, and then Cassie—making quick disguise and grabbing theSandals of Hermesand Gauntlet of Atlas—decided to assist, calling herselfWonder Girl, though here she just got in the way. The scientists managed to help Diana from the lab, even whenDecayshowed up and attacked them.[59]\nCassie was eager to prove herself as Wonder Girl and Diana was eager to train her—but her mother Helena emphatically rejected the idea. Cassie snuck out of the house, getting into a battle with Decay which almost ended in a stalemate. Diana, of course, showed up and defeated Decay. Meanwhile, back in Boston,Vanessa Kapateliswas still being plagued by nightmares because of her torment at the hands ofDoctor Pscyho—but at long last she was able to turn the tables on him in her dreams.[60]\nSoon afterwards, Diana helped out inThe Final Night, although aside from crowd control, her part was minor. After that, she got involved with some of the Earth's greatest heroes to stopKnow Man[61]In the wake of that, a group of aliens called theHyperclanarrived, promising to help turn Earth into paradise. Their cover was quickly broken, and they were discovered to be a group of renegadeWhite Martians. After helping defeat the Martians, Diana joined with the others to become a charter member of the new Justice League.[62]\nA series of minor earthquakes began to be felt worldwide. Three animal-men broke into the Gateway Museum, then escaped in a transparent aircraft. They later broke into a second museum, only to escape again. Diana and Champion, using a private plane of his, tracked them to Antarctica, where they discovered the ancient city of Lansinar far beneath the ice and were captured by its inhabitants. TheChallengers of the Unknownwere there as well. Thepeoplethere, living in darkness for 40,000 years, had no eyes, but their rulers—all of whom resembled ancientEgyptian deities—did. The rulers explained that long ago, theirs was an advanced city-state on a continent further north—but 400 centuries ago, the continent shifted to where it was, burying them beneath the ice (this timeframe would seem to correspond with the fall ofAtlantisas well). The four immortal rulers took the form of beast men, and they traveled to Ancient Egypt and helped them build their grand civilization—but they were no match for the coming ofAlexander the Greatand theGreek godsthat came with him. Some of the rulers were then imprisoned for centuries. Now they desired to return their continent to its proper place. Diana pointed out to them that their loyal followers could not long survive away from the home they had always known. The leaders decided to stay where they were, and they gave Diana aLansinarian Morphing Disk—a transparent object that could transform into anything she wished (like aninvisible jet). After they got back to Gateway, Mike Schorr expressed his attraction to Diana, but she told him she was not interested in him that way—she was also being hit on by Champion.[63]\nThe Amazons turned to stone\nIn the many weeks or months since Diana came to Gateway,Hippolytahad been wandering the city streets under the name \"Polly,\" befriending a few people but refusing to explain her origins. She had to be hospitalized, however, when her body began to change into stone. One of her new friends, a psychic namedAngelica, discovered who she really was. Diana, meanwhile, was searching for Mike Schorr, who had gone missing. She found him in the lair of a savage, feralCheetah. Attempting to strike Cheetah, Diana missed and struck a wall—only to have her hand shatter as if made of clay. Cheetah had made a deal withNeronduringUnderworld Unleashed—she had sold her soul in exchange for her assistantChumabeing restored to life. Unfortunately, with no soul in place, the base, savage aspects of the Cheetah began to overwhelm Barbara Minerva. With Chuma's help, Diana managed to revert Cheetah back to human form.Jason Bloodreturned to help Diana figure out what had happened to her hand. As Diana went over her whole history with Jason, she had a sudden feeling—a sense that something had happened to her mother. With Champion's help, Diana was able to find her mother—who had now completely turned to stone. Diana was fast turning that way too. Champion and her friends decided to take her home. Arriving on Paradise Island, they found the entire population of the city had turned to stone—all saveEudia, the Oracle, who had not yet fully turned. She said that what had happened occurred because the gods had left the Earth—but she pointed to Champion and revealed him to truly beHeraclesin disguise. In anger, Diana lashed out at him—and crumbled into dust.[64]\nThe Gods of Olympus restore Diana\nThe Greek gods reentered the scene. They called Heracles to their location and after he explained himself—saying that originally, he became Champion out of a desire for revenge but later fell in love with Diana—the gods realized that their departure from Earth is what triggered the Amazons reverting to the stone and clay from which they came. They restored Diana to life and ordered a hearing:JuliaandVanessa Kapatelis,Steve TrevorandEtta Candy, andHelenaandCassie Sandsmarkwere all summoned toOlympus. After the hearing, the gods decided to return to Earth, and with their return, the Amazons were restored to flesh. Before being sent home, Cassie managed to grab an audience withZeus, who decided to grant her wish of becoming a superhero.[65]\nDiana was gathered with Helena, Cassie andJason Bloodwhen a seemingly revivedArtemisstormed in, trying to kill Blood. Diana was forced to battle Artemis. She was joined in battle when Jason transformed intoEtriganand Cassie exhibited the new powers given to her by Zeus. The fight spilled out on the streets of Gateway. Hippolyta, who had returned to visit the friends she made from her wandering days, saw the fight—and Artemis—on television. She suddenly became terrified at the prospect of Artemis being alive again and feared for Diana's life. She and her entourage raced to the scene.Neronthen appeared on the battlefield and took all the parties present toHell. Neron split Jason from Etrigan, tormenting the former and Helena, whom he cared for, while forcing Diana to battle Etrigan. Artemis managed to free herself and Cassie and in the process, they found another of Neron's prisoners,Merlin. Artemis used the silver \"ornaments\" on her costume to injure Neron, but before withdrawing, the demon lord blasted Diana with a lethal bolt. Everyone was transported back to Gateway—with Diana lying an inch from death.[66]\nThe world feared Diana's death at the hands of Neron\nDiana was taken to the hospital.Donna Troycame, herself having just lost hersonandex-husbandin a car accident. One by one, the other members of theJustice Leaguearrived. They tried to heal Diana, but they could not, and she was all but dead. As her friends both in and out of the League kept vigil, her recovery looked bleak. Being incapacitated, Diana was not able to participate in theGenesisconflict, which involved not only the machinations ofDarkseidto controlThe Source, but also involved the evil of the war godAres—evil that nearly destroyed thegods of Olympusthemselves. Ares and Darkseid were both imprisoned on theSource Wallat the end of the conflict.[67]\nHippolyta, Donna Troy, and Cassandra had to rescue Diana from a rogue doctor who had hoped to transfer her own consciousness into Diana's body. It only confirmed what they had dreaded, Diana seemed truly dead. The gods intervened, however, answering everyone's prayers—Diana was resurrected, not just as a mortal, but as the new Goddess of Truth.Heratold Diana her days as Wonder Woman were over. Diana was uneasy in her new role, being told by her fellow goddesses that she could only aid those who called on her help. Meanwhile, on Themyscira, the Amazons decided that Hippolyta, having betrayed the trust of the island with her actions regarding Diana and Artemis, must be forced to do a penance: she must become the new Wonder Woman. This was made all the more possible by Hippolyta's augmentation thanks to her contact with the Source during the Genesis crisis.[68]\nIt was during Hippolyta's time as Wonder Woman that the \"true\" history ofDonna Troywas at last revealed. When Diana was a child, the Amazon sorceressMagalaused a spell to create a perfect duplicate of Diana to be her playmate. No one but the three of them knew. Six months later,Dark Angel, an enemy of Hippolyta's from when she traveled back in time, came to the island and kidnapped the duplicate, thinking she was the original Diana, and forced her to live a thousand different lives that all ended in tragedy. Thanks to Diana's intervention, Donna Troy was restored to life (with help fromThe Flash), but Diana was \"punished\" for her interference by being made back into a mortal again. Her mother eagerly stepped aside to let her resume her role as Wonder Woman.[69]\nCircereemerged, seeking revenge againstHippolytaand Diana. She used her magic to cause Hippolyta to forget who she was, resulting in Hippolyta thinking she was the wife of a man who had lost his. He thought she was his wife, and the same went for the man's son. Diana eventually broke through Circe's spell and reclaimed Hippolyta's memory, who then went back to Themyscira.[70]\nOne night,Oblivioncorrupted her Lansinarian Morphing Disk that started engulfingCentral City. The JLA came to know of the situation, and Superman decided to investigate it along with Batman. Bruce knew that Clark once had feelings for Diana and the two had wondered what would have happened if they had acted on it, also suspecting that his feelings might have resurfaced after her death. Diana meanwhile dreamed of having brought peace to the world. She did however so she could have at least a fleeting moment of love and thought her dream of peace in the world was a fantasy. Batman suspected that the disk responded to her deep desires. As the three are trapped by it, the disk plays out a dream of her and Superman falling in love and marrying while bringing peace to the world. In the dream, she is also introduced by him to Batman who she feels always sees the truth and becomes an important part of their lives. Batman confronts her and makes her realize that their desires are being manipulated. Though she doesn't want to break out of it, she accepts to do it after being made aware of the truth. Clark states that he never loved her, and they must go back to their lives. Batman assures her that she'll never be alone as they are there for her and the three finally break the disk's hold using her lasso.[71]\nThe ancient titanCronusemerged from the depths of time, desiring to be the new supreme god of all. He created a new pantheon for himself, and with his pantheon created a twisted doppelganger of Diana, the child villain known asDevastation.\nShe and Superman were transported toAsgardand forced to fight in a battle with the Norse gods against an army of demons for one thousand years. Even after a thousand years, when they were facing certain death and had no idea if they would ever get home. Although the two developed some romantic attraction thinking 1,000 years had passed on Earth, Superman remained faithful to Lois, Diana realized he would always love Lois and stated she understood, stating his eternal love for Lois was something that was perfect and not silly. The two were transported back to the time they were taken from in return for defeating the demon horde.[72]Superman met Diana again during Christmas tells him to spend time with Lois, who had been kidnapped and had been impersonated byParasitesince theY2Kcrisis, instead of focusing on Luthor being President, he gifts her a Mjolnir replica as a reminder of their time inAsgardwhich results in the two sharing a kiss.[73]\nLois also got an opportunity to talk with her in the form of a long interview that began with an around the world tour and that ended in a round of pool inSuicide Slum. Lois, having been jealous at times towards the Amazon Princess due to her closeness to her husband, took the opportunity to clear the air somewhat. She explained that it's difficult with Diana seeming so perfect and the whole world being convinced that the two must be an item. She gets a look into Diana's personal life and realizes that she's not perfect, but her highest quality is that she is able to love others despite their shortcomings. Lois also learnt about the war she waged with Clark in Asgard, but he only loved her, though Lois was disappointed that he never told her about their time there. Diana admits she had feelings for Superman and regrets not acting on it in past. She states that he is her best friend to which Lois replies that he is her best friend too. She maintains that the two of them are and will always be just close friends, regretting that she won't ever be so with Lois too because she hates her. Lois tells her she doesn't and assures that she respects and trusts her, leading to the two becoming close friends.[74]Diana later looks out for them both and often reminds Superman to go to her instead of remaining busy in his duties or in other things as the two need each other.[73][75][76]Lois was caring towards her at times as well, including when she underwent emotional problems due to Hippolyta's death or her killing of Max Lord.\nWonder Woman published a book, entitledReflections\nDiana began working as the Themysciran Ambassador to theUnited Nationsand moved into anembassyin New York. She fully embraced her status as a diplomat and a purveyor of peace, and published a book entitledReflections: A Collection of Essays and Speeches.Reflectionswas highly successful but garnered controversy over its content, particularly its mentions of the Greek pantheon and its progressive ideas. Diana's newfound position on the world stage earned her the envy of a wealthy woman namedDoctor Veronica Cale, who hated Wonder Woman, believing her to be unworthy of the powers she possessed. Cale began a campaign to oppose Diana, putting her immense wealth and power behind groups that spoke against Wonder Woman, and acquiring the villainsDoctor PsychoandSilver Swanin an attempt to use their powers to cause a riot among protestors at the embassy. Doctor Psycho used his mind-controlling powers to force a civilian to shoot the anti-Wonder Woman protestor, Darrel Keyes, while Silver Swan was set upon Diana to distract her. Wonder Woman was able to calm Silver Swan, and took Vanessa Kapatelis into the embassy in an attempt to treat her for the damage that had been done to turn her into the Silver Swan. Psycho, however, was shot on the orders of Cale.[77]\nMeanwhile,Aresset into motion a plan to replace his fatherZeusas ruler ofOlympus. He succeeded in creating rifts between thegods, resulting in a fight between Zeus andHerathat saw Hera cause great damage to Themyscira in her anger. Diana's attempts to restore Vanessa's health led her toLeslie Anderson, the business partner of Veronica Cale and a highly experienced surgeon. Leslie had previously supported Veronica's attacks against Wonder Woman, but she began to see Diana differently after meeting her and agreed to help treat Vanessa.\nDiana who spent a lot of time combat training against Batman alone together in the Watchtower, eventually developed a flirtatious relationship with Bruce.[78]After their fight withManitou RavenandTezumak, she noted he had broken a shaman spell to save her which wasn't possible with mere will, though Batman won't make his feelings clear.[79]When Justice League went into the past to saveAtlantisand Diana nursed him back to health as he was still delirious from time travel, she joked how she forgets he is human. But Bruce, before passing out, says he is an imperfect human who is beautiful, like she is.[79]The two kiss before being killed along with the rest of the JLA by theLeague of Ancientsand resurrected due to a repentant Manitou Raven and Kyle's sacrifice.[80]\nThe two decided to confront their feelings and set up their first date atWayne Manor,[81]but Bruce couldn't make it because he was crime-fighting.[82]They are however unable to find free time with each other and Diana finally decides to use theTransconsciousness Articulatorto examine her subconsciousness, seeing both good and bad dreams about their future. Eventually when they discussed their relationship together, Diana stated that she didn't want to risk their marriage though they had potential.[83]\nWith the help of Batman, Wonder Woman discovered that Psycho was responsible for Keyes' murder. Unbeknownst to Veronica Cale, Psycho had used his powers to impersonate a member of her security, and it was he who shot the security guard rather than the other way around. Psycho came back for revenge and tied up Veronica in a closet atCale-Anderson Pharmaceuticals. Wonder Woman happened to be visiting Leslie Anderson at the time, and managed to rescue Veronica Cale, though Psycho escaped.[84]\nWonder Woman's foe, the powerful witchCirce, was enlisted by theGorgonsto resurrect the legendary GorgonMedusa, who had been beheaded by the Greek heroPerseus. Circe succeeded in restoring Medusa, who immediately sought revenge againstAthenafor cursing her in the first place. Circe encouraged her to kill Athena's chosen champion, Wonder Woman, and informed her of another that hated Wonder Woman as much as she: Veronica Cale. Meanwhile, Doctor Psycho revealed to Diana that Cale was behind the resurgence of himself and the Silver Swan.\nWonder Woman battles Medusa\nMedusa traveled to the Themysciran embassy but retreated due to her horror upon seeing modern life. Her gaze turned a bird to stone, however, leading Diana to become aware of her existence, and she realized she would be forced to kill her. Diana attended a dinner party at theWhite House, which Medusa ambushed, turning dozens of guards to stone in the process. Wonder Woman fought her, but Medusa managed to escape and instead attack the embassy. Diana followed her and escorted her staff to safety, but Medusa's gaze turnedMartin Garibaldi, the son of Diana's employeePeter Garibaldi, to stone. Furious at Medusa's murder of a child, Wonder Woman was prepared to kill her, but refrained after Medusa invoked Ares and challenged Diana to a battle to the death. The punishment for ignoring such a challenge was torture lasting 1000 years, so Diana was forced to accept.\nVeronica Cale arranged for the battle to be televised, intending for the world to witness the death of Wonder Woman. Diana fought blindfolded in order to avoid Medusa's gaze, but Medusa managed to remove the blindfold and was about to turn Diana to stone. Wonder Woman quickly blinded herself using the venom of one of Medusa's snakes, and decapitated Medusa without the use of her sight.[85]\nThe GorgonsEuryaleandSthenoattempted to avenge their sister but were defeated by thePegasus, which sprang from Medusa's severed head. Doctors from Man's World and Themyscira were unable to restore Diana's eyesight, and she was forced to continue her heroics blind. Despite her lack of sight, Diana's skill in battle allowed her to hold her own in battle against theJustice Leagueduring an evaluation ordered by Batman.\nThe Gods of Olympus attempted to oust Zeus from the throne, causing him to unleashBriareos, the protector of his throne. Athena summoned her own champion, Diana, to fight him. Diana killed the beast by presenting the severed head of Medusa, turning him into stone. With Zeus' champion defeated, Athena took the throne of Olympus. After Athena's ascension to the throne, Zeus,PoseidonandHadesrequested Ares' help in overthrowing her and restoring the throne to Zeus.[86]\nWonder Woman, Wonder Girl and Ferdinand descend into the underworld\nAthena called upon Wonder Woman once more, requesting her aid in freeingHermesfromTartarus. Together withWonder GirlandFerdinand, Diana descended into the underworld. The trio foughtEmpusai, monsters guarding the underworld, and ventured into Tartarus until they discovered Zeus, Poseidon and Hades. Hades set the demonEurynomoson Diana, Cassie and Ferdinand, though they overcame him and discovered Hermes. Hades attempted to kill Diana but was interrupted by Ares, who betrayed the three gods, having agreed with Athena to deceive them in exchange for dominion over the underworld himself. Hermes was rescued and Poseidon and Hades were defeated, while Zeus submitted and returned to Olympus with the heroes.\nAfter their victory, Athena granted each of the heroes one gift. Wonder Woman wished for Martin Garibaldi to be restored to life, and Athena obliged. She also bound her own vision to Diana's, restoring her sight and granting her further empathy and wisdom.[87]\nWonder Woman fights Superman under the influence by Max Lord\nWhile under a psychotic episode induced byMaxwell Lord, Superman brutally beat Batman, though Diana tried to save him. She was frightened with the thought of him going rogue and was worried about Bruce whom she personally nursed back to health.[88]He later engaged in an all-out violent fight with Wonder Woman, thinking she was his enemyDoomsdayand Lois had been killed. Lord tried to mind control Diana but failed as she is immune to this kind of power. Wonder Woman put up a valiant fight with the Man of Steel, using her Amazonian skill, powers and intelligence to fend off the raw power of Superman, who by now was completely insane with rage. When Superman was stunned, she realized that he wasn't her real enemy and held back her attacks—sustaining more injuries as a result. She distracts him with him a flock of birds to get back to Lord and demanded that he release him. He refused and Diana cut Superman's throat with her tiara when he attacked again, thus making him realize he was fighting her. She demanded he free him from his control, but he mockingly replied that he will use him to kill his loved ones in the future and she'll have to kill him to stop it. Diana in response snapped his neck and freed Superman who was horrified.[89]\nThis action resulted in significant ramifications for Diana; her relationships with both Superman and Batman were seriously strained as they objected to her use of lethal force, no matter the circumstance.[89]Lois however stood up for her, stating she had no choice in order to save lives.[90]Bruce and Clark would only come to fully forgive her after the events of Infinite Crisis. The status of Wonder Woman amongst the other heroes and the public at large was uncertain as theBrother Eyesatellite (the deranged Artificial Intelligence controlling theOMAC units) broadcasted the footage of Wonder Woman killing Maxwell Lord, preceded by the word MURDER, to media outlets all over the world.\nWonder Woman snaps Maxwell Lord's neck, an action that changed the world's perception of her\nWonder Woman defended herself from several OMACs who attacked her in her own home. Having repelled the assailants, she was delivering an injured boy to the hospital when she saw a broadcast of the damaging video on the waiting room's television. She witnessed first-hand how people viewing the footage reacted with fear and revulsion; Brother Eye had managed to kill the faith the world had in her. At the start ofInfinite Crisis, Batman and Superman distrusted Diana: the latter could only see her as a coldblooded murderer, the former saw in her an expression of the mentality that led several members of theLeagueto decide tomindwipetheir villains. This hit close to home with Batman as his memory had been altered when he tried to stop the League from mind-wipingDoctor Lightafter the villain brutally rapedSue Dibny.\nTo make matters worse, Brother Eye, acting out of vengeance for the murder of Lord, initiated the final protocol, Truth and Justice, which aimed for the elimination of allAmazons. A full-scale invasion ofThemyscirawas set into motion, utilizing every remaining OMAC. Diana and her sisters, now isolated and alienated from the outside world, were forced to fight for their lives. The Amazons prepared to destroy the OMACs with a powerful new weapon, the Purple Ray of Death. However, Wonder Woman realized that Brother Eye was watching and transmitting, and that unleashing such destructive violence would only exacerbate the effects of her killing of Maxwell Lord. After the weapon was used once, Wonder Woman convinced the Amazons to shut it down. She then called uponAthena, who transported Paradise Island and the Amazons remaining on it to another dimension. However, Wonder Woman chose not to join them, and was left to face the OMACs alone.\nDiana Prince, secret agent\nOne Year Later,Donna Troyhad taken up the mantle of Wonder Woman, after a year in which Diana went missing. Diana re-appeared in the guise of Diana Prince, a secret agent. Batman had helped her create her new secret identity, while Clark had also suggested to him that he make her wear glasses. Diana joined theDepartment of Metahuman Affairsand was partnered withNemesis. During her introduction to the team, she was brought up to speed on the surveillance information available on Wonder Woman. Prior to dropping out of sight, Wonder Woman was last observed in the company of an eastern mystic namedI-Ching.\nWonder Woman asked lawyerKate Spencer(whom she knew to be the vigilanteManhunter) to represent her before the federal grand jury that was to determine if she should be tried for the murder ofMaxwell Lord(even though she had been exonerated by the World Court). With the help ofSasha BordeauxofCheckmate, Kate Spencer obtained a video of Wonder Woman killing Maxwell Lord which proved that Max was in control ofSupermanwhen she killed him. However, Wonder Woman would not allow Kate to use the evidence, as it would lead people to distrust Superman who she stated that the world needed. Upon concluding their deliberations, the grand jurors refused to indict Diana. The World Court then entirely dropped the charges against Diana for the killing of Lord.[91]\nOn Diana's first mission to save then Wonder Woman, Donna Troy, from a team of supervillains, she was joined byWonder Girl,Robin, Nemesis and the gods' new champion,Hercules. After revealing herself,Circestole their powers and Diana was betrayed by Hercules, who revealed he and Circe were the only gods who defiedAthena's edict to vacate the mortal plane. Circe then betrayed Hercules and de-powered him as well. Eventually, Diana's powers were restored, and she took the mantle of Wonder Woman again for the first time since handing over that title to Donna.\nDiana, Superman, andBatmanmet to re-form theJustice League. After a battle againstSolomon Grundy, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) andBlack Canaryoffered membership to those involved in the last mission. The JLA andJSAjoined forces when members of theLegion of Super-Heroeswerediscovered in the 21st Century.[92]\nDiana was captured and imprisoned by theDepartment of Metahuman Affairs, which was led bySarge Steel. She was tortured and interrogated to garner information that would allow theUnited States Governmentto build a Purple Death Ray like the one the Amazons revealed during the Infinite Crisis. Moments prior to the Amazon assault on Washington, D.C., Diana was freed byNemesis.\nCircetraveled to Themyscira and resurrected QueenHipployta. Hippolyta's first words were: \"Where is my daughter?\" Under Circe's influence, the Queen of the Amazons led an assault on the United States. After the attack, all Amazons who participated had their memories erased by thegodssave for Queen Hippolyta, who, freed from Circe's spell, lamented the destruction caused. A ban was also put in place that prevented any of the Amazons who were away fromThemyscirafrom returning, again save for Hippolyta.\nAround this time Wonder Woman was attacked by a combat unit of superpowered albinoGorilla KnightsfromGorilla City.Gorilla Groddplayed on the young gorillas' feelings of rage after encounters with poachers and trained and equipped them to be the ultimate combat unit, fit to take on the likes ofSupermanand Wonder Woman, and sent them to attack Diana. Diana talked them down and convinced them of Grodd's deceptive ways.Tolifhar, their leader, swore their service to her until tempers cooled enough for her to negotiate their return home to Gorilla City withKing Solovar. They moved into her apartment as a temporary measure.\nA group of Nazis who had been given abilities similar to those ofCaptain Nazitook advantage of Themyscira's empty state. When Wonder Woman encountered Captain Nazi on a mission as Diana Prince, she learned of their plans after defeating him and set out to thwart them, knowing her mother stood alone in Themyscira's defense. While Queen Hippolyta fought a one-person resistance campaign against the Nazis, Diana beseeched god after god from various pantheons for their aid in bypassing the ban and reaching Themyscira, but none were willing to faceAthena's wrath exceptKane Milohai. He agreed to adopt Diana as a champion and daughter, and gave her his standard, a cloth tied around her arm, as well as a seashell that could float in air and water, grow in size to carry passengers, and could travel between dimensions.\nWonder Woman faces the Circle\nWith the arrival of the Gorilla Knights and Wonder Woman, the Nazis, though powerful, found themselves in a fight they weren't ready for, and having already suffered in morale from the casualties inflicted by the Amazon Queen, they surrendered and withdrew from the island when faced with Wonder Woman's skill. While they were there, however, they freed four Amazon criminals. Once Hippolyta's personal guard, the Circle, led byAlkyonealong withMyrto,CharisandPhilomela, had been imprisoned ever since Diana's birth. They believed her to be a curse who would destroy Themyscira and attempted to kill her as a baby.\nThe Circle attacked immediately, inflicting wounds with god-forged arrows. They challenged Wonder Woman to singlehandedly face all four of them to retrieve her mother, who had been injured in the previous battles and whom they had taken. Three of them ambushed Diana and inflicted further wounds, though Wonder Woman defeated them. Diana confronted Alkyone and called her bluff on her willingness to hurt her Queen. Refusing to surrender despite being outmatched, Alkyone made one last desperate attack, then leaped into the sea. The other three members of the Circle were returned to their cells and remained unrepentant. Diana left the island once more, though several of her gorilla friends decided to remain behind on Themyscira with Hippolyta.\nThe Amazons fought in atonement when Earth was attacked by the Citizenry, a civilization of ruthless and powerful warriors who had wiped clean countless worlds and slain many champions and armies, including members of theGreen Lantern Corps. Diana found that their leader was once an Amazon claiming to be Hippolyta's sister who had been taken from Earth millennia ago and reshaped in their ways. Wonder Woman fought her and her daughter in orbit aboard their ships while the Amazons, assisted byAchillesand Diana's Gorilla Knights, defended Washington D.C., the center-point of the invasion. Hippolyta stayed in Washington D.C. to atone for the actions committed by her and the Amazons and helped to rebuild the damaged city alongside Achilles' men.[93]\nA short time later,Darkseidattacked and gained control of Earth. Wonder Woman was attacked byMary Marvel, who turned Wonder Woman into a \"plague vector\" for a new strain of theMorticoccus virus.[94]After this, Wonder Woman was turned into an enforcer for Darkseid and defended her new master's realm against the heroes of the Earth.[95]After Superman's return, Wonder Woman was attacked byFrankensteinand Darkseid's hold over her was lost. Regaining control of her actions, Wonder Woman chained Darkseid's body with her Lasso, allowing Superman to finally eliminate Darkseid's control over the Earth.[96]\nShe was one of the few heroes who attended Batman's private funeral and decided to hand his cape toDick Graysonthinking that it belonged with him. Unlike Superman, she was happy that Dick became the new Batman and carried on his legacy, later questioning Clark for trying to make him take it off.[97]\nMain articles:Blackest NightandJustice League: Generation Lost Vol 1\nWonder Woman as a Star Sapphire during Blackest Night\nNekron, the Guardian of Death, resurrectedthe supposed dead body of Bruce Wayneand released a swarm ofBlack Lantern Ringswhich attached themselves to heroes who had died and been resurrected by using Bruce as an emotional tether with them, making Wonder Woman aBlack Lantern. She grievously injuredMerawhile possessed but is able to resist from killing her and flees to an island. In her imagination, both Wonder Girl and Donna are killed. She also nearly kills Hippolyta but is stopped by Bruce.\nWhen each of theLantern Corpswere recruiting a deputy member for 24 hours, aStar Sapphire Ringattached itself to Wonder Woman and expelled the Black Ring from her after she kissed Bruce in a vision.Aphroditeappeared and told her that the ring recognizes she has a love for all creation. Diana states that she was not worthy of redemption after what she did to her family, but the goddess states that it was only her imagination and the island itself was created so her possession didn't harm anyone. The ring turned her into aStar Sapphire Corpsmember. She also subdued Mera, who had gone berserk due to theRed Lantern Ring, after peering into her heart. She was later turned into aWhite LanternbySinestrowho had fused withThe Entityand helped in defeating Nekron.\nThe Entity also resurrected some deceased people who had been resurrected by Nekron earlier. This included Maxwell Lord who had been killed by Wonder Woman long ago. The Justice League after finding this out, convinced the whole world to launch a manhunt for him. He decided to continue hunting her regardless. Using his psychic powers which had increased manifold since his resurrection, he mindwipes everyone and causes them to forget he ever existed, including Wonder Woman herself. OnlyJustice League InternationalmembersBooster Gold,Captain Atom,FireandIcewho were present at the same site escaped it.[98]\nWhen theBatman Familydiscovers that Bruce is alive and hurtling through time with enough built-up Omega Energy to destroy creation, Diana takes over the leadership of the League in absence of Superman, with whom contact had been lost while he looked for Bruce with otherTime Masters. She upgrades the alert level to black and has them prepare for Bruce's arrival.[99]He surprises them by arriving at the Watchtower and easily defeats everyone due to being infused with an Architect, only stopping so as to not harmRed Robinand her. After he starts regaining his memories due to them, he tells her to use the Lasso and learns he deliberately became an amnesiac so Darkseid'sHyper-Adapterwon't go after him and he deliberately brought it here. It however overtakes him and easily overwhelms Diana, but the Time Masters arrive to help her stop it. Bruce states this was his plan all along and successfully separates from it before having her and Superman sent back through time in a Time Sphere. He starts dying of the Omega radiation, but Diana and Superman are able to save him.[100]\nDiana discovers Themyscira destroyed\nDiana suddenly found herself in a new world with her memories mysteriously erased. In this altered world,Themyscirawas destroyed andHippolytawas killed, with the survivingAmazonsrelocating elsewhere and taking a young Diana with them. Diana grew up with no knowledge of what happened to her mother or her origin. Through meeting an oracle, Diana discovered Themyscira was attacked, and the Amazons slaughtered. She asked the oracle to show her how her mother died, and it was seen that Hippolyta sacrificed herself and killed herself in the fire as to not reveal the whereabouts of her daughter.[101]\nDiana helped to relocate other surviving Amazons after another attack was plotted against them with the purpose of getting Diana out in the open. Diana's odyssey brought her into conflict withThe Morrigan, two of a trinity of war goddesses related to the destruction of Themyscira:AnannandBellona. Diana was the target of a resurrectedMaxwell Lordwho discovered to his bewilderment that no one had ever heard of her. He switched targets but decided to keep hunting her. Only the four JLI heroes present at the site where he began his global mindwipe remembered her and they too were surprised no one else knew about her nor any record of her existed.[102]\nSupermanmeanwhile is left inLincolnby theSuperman Squad, knowing that she will be inspired by his actions to become a superhero. Diana watched him as he rescued vehicles from being swept away during a tornado. When he saw her flying away from the flood waters, she seemed familiar, but he didn't remember about ever meeting her. He asked her to assist him in saving other people and she agreed. While saving a woman, who was secretlyLisa Jennings, she was attacked by her. Lisa stated that she ruined her plan of making Superman see that one sometimes has to sacrifice a few to save the many. Diana in response punches her, but Lisa states that she should focus on rescuing the people instead as Superman asked. She flies away and rescues more people. Superman thanks her, though she informs him that she was just a warrior on quest for vengeance and only did it after being inspired by his heroic actions. She informed him about the woman who attacked her before leaving.[103]\nBlue Beetlewas able to remember her and Max Lord after his mind wipe was made ineffective due to the intense pain he suffered while Max tried to take off his armor. Bruce Wayne had also remembered who she was due to theWhite Lantern Ringand found out that she was in New York City. Someone had been slaughtering her fellow Amazons and she intended to find out who it was and refused when Batman tried to convince her to come with them.[104][105]As they were talkingOMACsshowed up, he realized they were hunting them to find her. They activated a teleportation portal, which took Booster, Beetle,Rocket Red, Ice, Fire and Diana toLos Angeles.[106]\nDiana and the other heroes were then attacked byOMAC Prime, deployed by Max Lord for murdering her.[106]Blue Beetle however is able to rescue her by injecting it with theBlue Beetle Scaraband taking control of it, before blowing it up. Maxwell was also forced by Captain Atom to undo his mind-wipe and make everyone remember about everything he had done.[107]\nWonder Woman fights the Centaur god\nThe Morrigan sent a series of warriors and monsters after Diana in order to try and shape her to become more like them so she could replace a fallen member of their trinity,Enyoand make the Morrigan whole again. A conventional force led by the same immortal who killed Hippolyta and now held the goldenLasso of Truthattacked a hidden Amazon temple. Diana's aid was enough to allow the Amazons to retreat and the attackers' leader was slain by her, avenging Hippolyta and returning the Lasso to its rightful hands. With it, Diana's own power increased, and she gained the ability to fly. The Morrigan's ruthless attacks did not end there, and even Diana's mentorPhilippusfell when the Morrigan sent the minor godCernunnos, aCentaurhuntsman, and aMinotaurafter Diana with the intent of driving her further into anger and hatred.\nThe Morrigan then took three fallen Amazons and imbued them with the spirits ofArtemis,Giganta, andCheetahand turned them against the enclave of Amazons that sheltered Diana. Against the might of the three warriors, the Amazons were defeated, and all were slaughtered, while Diana herself was badly injured. She escaped death thanks to the unlikely aid ofDoctor Psycho, whose powers allowed him to realize the timeline had been altered.[108]\nUsing his psychic abilities, Psycho showed visions of alternate timelines of Diana's life. He explained that she could become Wonder Woman, but it would have to be something she chose to be, and said he'd rather be part of her life, even as a villain, than part of the current state of the world. Diana was taken to a hospital where she quickly recovered. There she met an elderly patient at the hospital, one of theFates,Clotho. Clotho explained that she had given Diana a 'backup' fate, so that if hers was severed she would survive and be able to fight back against the forces who had done so, and that was Diana now. The fate then gave Diana a cloth she had spun with a blue and white star-pattern similar to her pre-Odyssey outfit, which Diana donned as a cap as the Amazons with the spirits of Artemis, Giganta, and Cheetah returned.\nFinding her strength had increased once more, Diana easily defeated the three empowered Amazons, and convinced them to surrender and join her to avenge all of their comrades rather than follow the Morrigan's way and die. The three Amazons joined Diana in attacking the Morrigan, however things went badly as a mystical sword stabbed Diana, transfixing her in place. The other three died to the Morrigan, though in turn, Bellona died at the hands of their own warriorAjax, who had been freed by Psycho. This left only the strongest, their leader Anann. Diana was shown a vision of what could happen if the Morrigan's plan for her succeeds, and she saw herself clad in green, wielding theFlashing Bladeand standing at the head of an army of the dead. In her vision, Diana was marching over the Earth with a cause of justice untampered by mercy and slaying even her friends in theJustice Leagueincluding Batman,Martian Manhunter,Green Lantern, and finally dispatching Superman himself after he tries to stop her.\nAs the vision ended, Anann began torturing Diana with her powerful magic to force her to give in and join the Morrigan, but while doing so she overlooked that her powers had not quite killedArtemis. The badly burned Amazon regained her bow and shot the goddess in the neck, causing Anann to lose the ability to release her magic, which resulted in her exploding. In the rubble of their building, Diana grabbed her Lasso which led her back to the door where the vision had come from, but before she passed through, she was met by theGods of Olympus, who told her what happened; they were in exile out of fear ofNemesis, a goddess gone mad. Knowing that within her own realm, only the strongest heart could hope to stand against Nemesis, they tasked Diana to succeed where they could not.\nA battle of two Wonder Women\nClimbing through the doorway to Nemesis' realm, Diana fought through constructs in the shape of the dead, only to meet something unexpected holding the other end of her Lasso; herself, wearing her traditional uniform but also holding the Flashing Blade, who attacked. As they fought, it became clear the other Wonder Woman was stronger, and she chided Diana for talking instead of acting. Diana attempted to break through to her with words, but the other Wonder Woman cut her with the Flashing Blade, giving Diana a vision once again.\nDiana discovered through the vision that before the Odyssey began, the Morrigan were gathering an army to attack Themyscira, and Wonder Woman had confronted the three goddesses. However, this was a lure by the evil Nemesis, Goddess of Retribution. Wonder Woman fought the three Morrigan, causing the death of Enyo when she was thrown into the path of a blow from Bellona that was meant for Diana. As the other two pressed the attack out of anger, Nemesis herself came forth and attacked the already worn Wonder Woman, impaling her with her Flashing Blade—identical to the one the false Wonder Woman carried. The blade bestowed upon Diana not death, but instead allowed Nemesis to steal her life, her form, and her power and take them on herself. Only thanks to the meddling of Clotho did a sliver of Diana's consciousness escape from this event, and the new timeline was forged.\nBack in the present, Nemesis explained that while her power was sufficient to fend off foes in her realm, she needed to scour humanity of its valor and bring its greatest warrior to heel, so that she could bring vengeance upon all who deserved it and end humanity. With Wonder Woman defeated and her passion for justice bent to vengeance, nothing would be strong enough to stop the mad goddess' retribution. Diana rebuked that living among mortals didn't make her hate them, but Nemesis said it didn't matter and Diana would become part of her now, impaling her with the sword once more. Using Clotho's strand of fate, however, Diana freely merged with her old self and power, casting the spirit of Nemesis out and declaring herself Wonder Woman once more. Wonder Woman denounced Nemesis' plan as a mad scheme, saying that the soul of an Amazon could never be bent to her merciless hate, and she would never be her champion.\nDeclaring Diana's death, Nemesis attacked once more in her own body, but this time Wonder Woman was strong enough to resist; she was not only unwounded, but with her new strength added to her old. Nemesis transformed by calling upon the strength of all murdered souls who cry out for vengeance, but Wonder Woman seized her own sword and slew her with it. As Nemesis died, she revealed that Diana had passed a final test and expressed joy that she would be freed in death; the cries of the murdered would no longer roar in her ears, while Diana would take her place to mete out punishment, and if Diana would not be her champion, she would take up her wrath and become the new Nemesis. As Nemesis died, armor reminiscent of the armor in her first vision covered Diana, and the truth of Nemesis' words sank in, as Diana felt the pain of the unjustly killed that had driven Nemesis mad over thousands of years and it filled her with her terrible strength. However, also within Diana's heart still resided the memories of those who loved her and turned to her for protection. Wonder Woman declared she would take Nemesis' place and be the new wielder of the Flashing Blade, but would also be its last wielder, as she broke it over her knee.\nWonder Woman after the Odyssey\nWith that, the spells and changes of fate on the rest of the world were broken, and Wonder Woman suddenly found herself on Themyscira, intact and whole, again, in the way of an archery contest between Artemis and Philippus. She rushed forward and hugged Philippus, then ran off to see her mother, leaving the two Amazon warriors confused. Diana met Hippolyta and the two talked, Diana discussing the Odyssey she had been through while ignoring the League business for a while. She also commented that she could feel there wasanother changecoming, but Hippolyta reassured her that whatever change was to come, Diana would remain her daughter, they would remain Amazons, and Diana would always be Wonder Woman. Holding the words with her, Diana then flew off into the sky. She soon rejoined the League after returning.[109]\n\nMain article:Wonder Woman Recommended Reading\n\n\nBlack Lantern CorpsmemberThis character is or was a member of theBlack Lantern Corps.

PeterFirst AppearanceWonder WomanVol 2  #1(February, 1987)\nPrincess Diana of Themyscira, also known asWonder Woman, is a founding member of theJustice League of Americaand one of the strongest female superheroes on the planet. She is a princess of theAmazonsofParadise Island, sculpted from clay byQueen Hippolytaand given life by theGods of Olympus. She is a champion of love, truth and peace, and uses her god-given powers to bring these values to Man's World.\nThe origin of Wonder Woman\nDiana is the daughter of QueenHippolyta, the first child born onParadise Islandin the three thousand year history that the immortalAmazonslived there. The Amazons had been created around 1200 B.C. when the Greek goddesses drew forth the souls of all women who had been murdered by men and placed them on the island. One soul was held back from creation, the one that would be born as Diana. That soul originally belonged to the unborn daughter of the first woman murdered by a man (whom Hippolyta was the reincarnation of). In the late 20th Century, Hippolyta was instructed to mold some clay from the shores of Paradise Island into the form of a baby girl. Six members of theGreek Pantheonthen bonded the soul to the clay, giving it life. Each of the six also granted Diana a gift:Demeter, great strength;Athena, wisdom and courage;Artemis, a hunter's heart and a communion with animals;Aphrodite, beauty and a loving heart;Hestia, sisterhood with fire;Hermes, speed and the power of flight. (It has been suggested that Diana isPandorareborn, who was also molded from the clay of the earth.[3]) Diana grew up surrounded by a legion of sisters and mothers. When she was a young woman, the gods decreed that the Amazons must send an emissary into Man's World, Diana who was bored of her surroundings and seeked adventure jumped at the opportunity to leave while following the mission to bring peace upon the world. Queen Hippolyta ordered a contest to be held, but forbade Diana from participating. Diana disobeyed and did so anyway in disguise, easily winning the contest and being named the Amazons' champion. She was given a uniform fashioned from the standard ofsomeonewho had visited the island a few decades earlier.[4]\nDiana did not keep her identity a secret, and she was not at first a \"super-heroine\". Indeed, her character was in many ways that of a babe in the woods, innocent and without guile. Diana spoke only Themyscirian, a combination of classical Greek and Turkish. She had to learn English when she arrived in America, rather than knowing the language intuitively. Nonetheless, Diana was trained as a warrior and had no compunction against using deadly force when called for. She often dealt with war, injustice, inequality, death, and conflicts involving the Olympian Gods.\nBefore embarking on her mission, Diana was given theLasso of Truth, forged byHephaestushimself. She was also given theSandals of Hermes, which allowed her to instantly traverse great distances in seconds. Diana's mission was one of peace, but part of it initially involved defeating a mad plot byAresto destroy the world. She ventured into the world by starting at Boston. There she met a Harvard professor, Dr.Julia Kapatelis, and her daughter,Vanessa Kapatelis, as well as the Air Force OfficersSteve TrevorandEtta Candy. Diana stayed with Julia and Vanessa and over the course of a month or two, she learned to speak English. She was attacked at their home byDecay, one of Ares' minions, and after a battle that spilled out into the streets of Boston she first came to the public's eye and was given the nameWonder Woman.Upon discovering Ares' plan (one that involved causing a nuclear holocaust), Diana managed to foil it, first battling his sonsPhobosandDeimosbefore finally convincing him the error of his ways using her Lasso. After defeating the God of War, Diana returned home for healing at the hands ofPoseidonhimself.[5]\nWonder Woman became a popular heroine and joined theJustice League of America. Her apprentice and pupilDonna Troy, thenWonder Girl, was a founding member of theTeen Titans. Diana, together withBatman,Superman,Flash, andAquaman, supported the teens and encouraged them to team up and work together with the Justice League.\nWonder Woman versus Ares\nAfter returning to Boston, Wonder Woman agreed to hireMyndi Mayerto be her publicist, with the aim of getting her image out to the world at large. She spent the next several months touring the world, conducting interviews and learning a lot about modern culture. She also initially met most of the Justice League including Batman and Superman around this time during theLegendsstoryline. After meeting Superman, she was initially discomforted by his attraction to her as she had never experienced such a thing before but found herself growing attracted to him over time.[6][7]\nWonder Woman gathered the attention ofBarbara Minerva, the Cheetah, who secretly desired to steal the Lasso of Truth from Diana. She lied to Wonder Woman about having found the lost Girdle of Antiope to get close to her, but after touching the Lasso her truth was made clear. Diana was frustrated and enraged over her naive trust of Minerva. That same night, Barbara decided to take the Lasso by force and attacked Wonder Woman as the Cheetah. Diana managed to fight her off, and decided it was time to return home to Paradise Island again.[8]\nChallenge of the Gods\nThe gods were pleased with Diana's work—one was a little too pleased, however.Zeusoffered to make Wonder Woman a goddess if she agreed to sleep with him. Diana refused, and Zeus decreed she must be punished for refusing his advances. The other gods managed to deflect the full brunt of Zeus's wrath. He decided that Wonder Woman must pass the Challenge of the Gods. He ordered her to go into the pits beneath Paradise Island and retrieve his fondest treasure, and Diana accepted the challenge. Hippolyta was not pleased, and though she could do nothing to stop Diana from descending into the depths, she did resolve to follow after her (fighting pastPhilippusfirst). Wonder Woman battled all number of evil monsters in the pits, from theHydrato theEchidnabut got some help from the spirit ofDiana Trevor. Diana Trevor, the mother of Steve Trevor, revealed that she had been an Air Force Pilot who crash landed on the island and then died helping the Amazons in battle. It was for her that Diana was named, and it was her standard that was used to fashion the Wonder Woman costume. Hippolyta caught up with her daughter, and together they fought even more mythological beasts until they discovered Zeus's treasure: his imprisoned demigod son,Heracles. The demigod had been changed to stone and made to bear the weight of the island for thousands of years for his actions against the Amazons. Diana and Hippolyta freed him and brought him back to the surface. Faced with his punishment of thousands of years, Heracles was repentant and begged forgiveness for what had happened between he and the Amazons. The Amazons forgave him at last, and after a celebration including a romantic reconciliation with Hippolyta, Heracles returned to Olympus. The gods were pleased with Diana. Hippolyta was pleased as well and ordered her daughter to return to Man's World and continue her mission.[9]\nOnce Wonder Woman was back, Myndi Mayer arranged a publicity stunt, this time at a fair. However, things took a negative turn when the firstSilver Swan, Valerie Beaudry, arrived on the scene. Wonder Woman battled the Swan along the coast but failed to capture her. Returning to Boston, Diana stayed with Vanessa while her mother was in Greece. Initially, when she had metSupermanalongside other heroes during theLegendsstoryline, was smitten by her and she felt uncomfortable as such things were new to her.[7]Though later she found herself distracted more and more with thoughts of Superman, eventually asking Myer to arrange a meeting between the two.[10]Diana and Superman had their \"date,\" which included a battle to free Olympus from the grip ofDarkseidafter he had laid waste to it. Superman and Wonder Woman decided it would be best if they just remained friends, but Superman trusted Diana enough with the secret of his dual identity.[11]\nThe emergence of Circe\nThe gods decided it was time to take a vacation (or \"Cosmic Migration\" as they called it) even as Diana decided to go with her friends to Greece, to see the ancient home of her people. She met Julia Kapetelis's parents but felt a strange sensation in regard to one of the smaller islands that was long said to have a bad history. As it turns out,Circemade that island her home, and she sent her minions to capture Diana and drag her back in chains. Circe revealed her whole history—including the fact that she murderedAntiope, Hippolyta's sister. Circe also revealed the prophecy she learned fromHecate, who was responsible for her power, and her belief that if either Circe or Diana kills the other then the spirit of Hecate will consume them. Circe resolved to use a spell that would degenerate Diana back in the clay from which she was created. Even with the help of her friends, Wonder Woman only carried the day with the timely intervention ofHermes, who had not yet left Olympus.[12]\nWhen Diana returned to Boston, she learned of the death of Myndi Mayer—someone had apparently shot her in the face with a shotgun in her own home. A man named Steve London was framed for the death, but Diana learned that the man responsible for killing her was a man namedSkeeter Boyd. Skeeter died trying to escape from Wonder Woman, grabbing hold of an electrified fence and frying himself. He had not, in fact, actually killed Myndi—an overdose of alcohol and cocaine had killed her before he delivered the blast. Diana was left to question how something like this could happen, ignorant of the effects of addiction and drug overdose.[13]\nCalled back to Paradise Island, Diana was summoned by the gods to come to Olympus with Hippolyta andMenalippe, which was still in ruins from Darkseid's rampage. The gods announced their decision to depart from the Earth, possibly forever, possibly not. They needed Diana's help to shatter what was left of Olympus so they could move on and allow the healing to begin. Their destiny now in their own hands, Diana called for a vote among the people whether or not they should open the gates of the island and allow men to come there. The Amazons voted yes, and Wonder Woman returned to Boston to invite Julia and Vanessa to be the first guests.[14]\nWonder Woman and her extended family\nDiana was shocked whenHermesshowed up in Boston. He explained that he believed the journey of the rest of the gods was folly and sought to assert himself, as a god, in Boston. He won a few converts through bribes and healing, despite Diana's protests. Hermes was tricked, however, byPhobosand the immortal gorgonEuryaleinto unleashingIxion the Assassinfrom his prison beneath the Earth. Ixion went on a rampage across Boston, killing hundreds and damaging the old U.S. Constitution. Hermes sent Diana a supernatural call for help, and she arrived just in time to confront Phobos, whom she bound with her Lasso. After attacking Ixion and flying him out of the city to prevent further death and destruction, Hermes managed to free himself and regain the Caudecus, the source of most of his godly power, and decapitated Eurayle. Meanwhile Ixion continued his battle with Diana, but even he proved to be no match for her superior strength. He told Diana about his thousands of years of torture and pleaded with her to kill him in order to end his suffering. Hermes then arrived on the scene with Phobos in tow, using his Caudecus to bind the monster, intending to imprison him once again. Phobos gloated to Diana that the only place Ixion could be properly imprisoned was beneath Themyscira. Diana was horrified, but before the matter could be resolved further, a squadron of jet fighters appeared on the scene. Seeing a chance to finally be freed of his suffering, Ixion broke free and charged the approaching planes, who then opened fire and killed him in response. Diana blamed herself for what happened, as she had not taken a stronger position against Hermes when he first arrived.[15]\nWonder Woman faces Cheetah\nCheetah decided to resurface, once again with the intention of stealing the Lasso of Truth. She used a pair ofKhunds, still on Earth after the invasion, to create a diversion so she could steal the Lasso. Suspecting that Dr. Barbara Minerva stole the lariat (but not knowing yet that she and Cheetah are one and the same) Wonder Woman traveled to Minerva's home in England (this coincided with a trip to the first meeting ofJustice League Europe, though Diana decided not to remain part of the team at this time). Minerva's manservant,Chuma, poisoned Diana and proceeded to tell her the whole story of how Minerva became Cheetah. The poison had no effect on Diana, however, and she tracked Cheetah to Egypt where out in the hidden city ofBana-Mighdallshe found thelost colony of Amazons. Their leader, QueenAnahid, incapacitated Diana with a poisonous dart and locked her away. The high priestess tried to kill Wonder Woman but died when Diana tossed her across the room, and she ended up swallowing the same poison dart Queen Anahid used on Diana earlier. Diana broke free and realized that Cheetah would be on the prowl that very night—but she was still groggy from the poison. The mercenary Amazons had been hired to pacify a nearby village. Armed for war, Wonder Woman fought them back and was attacked by Cheetah. After a vicious battle, Wonder Woman defeated her adversary and locked her up (Chuma was slain by gunfire during the fight). Queen Anahid, mortally injured by Cheetah during the battle, died after commanding that Diana be spared. The Amazons called off the raid and told her their history. They were indeed the descendants of Antiope, Hippolyta's sister, though they were not immortal. They had in their possession the otherGolden Girdle of Gaeaand were a nation of mercenaries and had been since Antiope's death.Phthia, blamingTheseusand all men for her mother's death, was their first leader. The city was then attacked by Hermes, who learned of and was enraged by the existence of the rogue Amazons and their possession of the Golden Girdle. Diana managed to convince him to cease his attack. One of the Amazons,Faruka, decided to use all the chaos to try and seize power, using an Amazon calledShim'tar. With Hermes weakened, Diana fought Shim'tar alone, battling to a standstill. The Egyptian government, outraged over the massacre at one of their villages, ordered an air strike on the hidden city. Not even Hermes was able to intervene, and the entire city was destroyed, leaving Wonder Woman, Cheetah, and Hermes alone in the desert. Wonder Woman recovered both her Lasso and the Golden Girdle. After a brief stop back in Boston, Diana returned the Girdle to her mother on Themyscira.[16]\nThemyscira and its visitors are manipulated by Eris\nThe time had come for Themyscira to welcome the world more openly. Twelve delegates were chosen: Asmund Lindel, the Norway delegate to the U.N.;Maritza Nitumbe, a South African botanist;Phyllis Haller, an American bestselling feminist author and sociologist;Vladimir Morakov, a Russian neurosurgeon;Robert Cantwell, a Scottish history teacher and war veteran;Rabbi Benjamin Hechtand Unitarian ministerReverand Alan Withersppon, the only two religious leaders to respond to Diana's invitation (the Vatican was silent);Lin Koo Teng, a survivor of theTiananmen Square massacre;Rovo Quashi, a blind man from Ethiopia;Henri Tibet, a paraplegic architect from Canada;Felix Zumac, a Haitian zoologist and anthropologist; andLois Lane, everybody's favorite reporter from the Daily Planet. Hermes, shedding his immortality, granted Diana the ability to use her winged sandals to take the delegates to Themyscira. The delegates all arrived to a magnificent greeting by the Amazons. No one suspected thatEris, daughter of Ares, was plotting discord. She nearly succeeded in turning everyone against one another, but her plans were discovered and thwarted. The delegates all delivered their favorable report to the U.N. while the Amazons commenced the cleanup. Julia was on a dig overseas and Vanessa was at summer camp. Hermes, shorn of some of his divinity, had been staying with Steve Trevor.[17]\nWonder Woman had her second run in with the Silver Swan, now more powerful than ever, when Valerie was attempting to escape from her \"benefactors.\" Wonder Woman andEtta Candywere captured byHenry Cobb Armbruster's thugs but working together they were able to break free. Using her Lasso on Armbruster, Diana was able to unveil the depth of his lies to Valerie. The Swan walked away, no longer the villain.[18]\nWonder Woman battles Mercury\nWith Themyscira known to the world and the gods departed from Earth, Queen Hippolyta decided it was indeed time to take a more active role. The Amazons removed theirbraceletsand decided to come to Man's World and see all that it had to offer.[19]Hipployta,Menalippe,Philippus, and other Amazons came to stay at a hotel inGotham City. Diana encountered Hermes again, who had rebuilt a temple unto himself and proceeded to flirt with Wonder Woman. This Hermes turned out to beMercury, and Wonder Woman had to help the true Hermes battle his \"evil twin\" at their temple. Mercury was able to win the battle, taunting the humbled Hermes as he departed the field. Hippolyta and the others decided they needed to present themselves as more than just an extension of Wonder Woman, and Steve Trevor told her that he needed some space as well, as Etta was growing jealous of the two of them. WhenVanessaalso got angry at Diana for being late to her birthday party and evenJuliawanted some space, Diana decided to return home to recharge. While at home, Diana was contacted in her sleep byHarmoniaas well asPariah, both of whom offered warnings about an impending crisis. After waking from this nightmare Diana seemed to drift into another one, involving a badly beaten and injured Hermes. Diana suspected thatCircewas behind her ill fortune lately.[20]\nBack in Boston, Wonder Woman encountered Hermes—who announced his intention to destroy Boston. Diana told him she would never let it be so—but from Hermes' point of view, it was the Amazon who was threatening the city. They began to battle one another, unaware that they were under the illusions ofDr. Psycho, who had been posing as a therapist for Vanessa. Diana and Hermes stopped short of killing one another when one of Vanessa's teachers interrupted the insane villain. Diana and Hermes, relieved of their delusions, joined together to track down their tormentor. Realizing that Psycho had been twisting the mind of Vanessa as well, Diana was able to connect her thoughts with Vanessa and track him down in his lair. There she found Vanessa's teacher, whose unborn baby had been tortured by Dr. Psycho as well. Meanwhile, the Amazons were attacked in their hotel by masked assassins, who also murdered the police officers at the building and framed it on the Amazons themselves. The word quickly spread, and by the time Wonder Woman had taken the injured teacher to the hospital, the police tried to arrest her for murder. Diana protested their innocence while alerting the police to the location of Dr. Psycho, whom she left tied up with her Lasso. However, when the police arrived, he was nowhere to be found; the Lasso was tied to a chair, but no one was there. Before the Boston P.D. took her in, Diana convinced them to allow her to help deliver the child, which she successfully did. A news report indicated that armed Amazons broke into the hotel in Gotham and slaughtered police and civilians alike.[21]\nWonder Woman allowed herself to be taken into custody where she learned the horrible tally: Hippolyta was missing, Philippus was gravely injured, Menalippe andEpionehad been arrested (the former with injuries),MnemosyneandTimandrahad been arrested in other cities,PythiaandEuboeawere unaccounted for, andHellenehad been killed. There was also an unidentified Amazon who was killed at the hotel, prompting a scare that there could be dozens of murderous Amazons on the loose. Vanessa came to the police station with news her mother was missing. Diana managed to convince the police to let her see the unidentified Amazon. The dead woman was unknown to her, but the tell-tale claw marks raking her body led her to believe she was killed by the Cheetah.Commissioner Gordonreluctantly ordered Diana arrested, but Diana, fearful for the safety of her friends, broke out of the jail. Recovering her Lasso, she freed Menalippe from her hospital before catching up with Pythia and Euboea and taking them all back to Paradise Island.[22]\nThe War of the Gods\nAt home, many of her Amazon sisters were crying out for vengeance, believing their queen to have been murdered. Diana asserted herself as the rightful leader of the Amazons, no matter what they decided to do. As they were debating, an oracle announced that the gods had returned. No sooner did she do so when Diana was summoned toMount Olympus.The godsannounced that something was terribly wrong with the order of things. They too had seenPariahand did not understand his importance. Zeus had expended much of his power just summoning Hermes from the Earth, and it had taken the combined energy of the rest of the pantheon to summon Diana there. They told her thatDonna Troyhad also turned up. Just then, a new set of gods emerged—it was theRoman pantheon, led byJupiterhimself. The Roman gods announced that they had a human champion that would battle against the Greeks' Wonder Woman—that champion was none other thanCaptain Marvel. Diana was forced to defend herself against a possessed Captain Marvel while Hermes and Mercury engaged in round two. Wonder Woman defeated Captain Marvel, while Circe began to unveil her master plan, unleashing chaos across the globe.[23]\nWhile Wonder Woman was on Olympus,Heraclestraveled to Paradise Island. Once there, earthquakes began to rock the island. Traveling beneath it, Heracles foundAtlaswith the island on his shoulders. This was the Roman Atlas, and he mistook Heracles forHercules. Back in the U.S., Mnemosyne, Timandra, and Epione were being transported by a military escort that was attacked by Amazons—but no Amazons the three prisoners recognized. These Amazons left a few survivors in the escort to tell the tale, then gassed the three prisoners and took them with them. Diana, after her victory over Captain Marvel, was transported back to Boston.[24]\nDiana ended up at the house of a police inspector,Edward Indelicato, whom she was friends with. She recounted her story and Edward agreed to help her. Diana, sensing thatCircetruly was to blame for all the madness going on, decided that she had to track downDoctor Fatefor assistance, who gave her a spell that made her invisible so she could return to Boston. The spell wore off when she (literally) ran into theSilver Swan, which was dumb luck as Valerie had been looking for Diana to give her some guidance. Diana had little to give, however, as distracted as she was by everything else going on.[25]\nA call toBlack Canaryput Diana in contact withBatman, whom she asked to retrieve the missing Themysciran goblet that she believed would help exonerate her people for the massacre in Gotham. Diana then banded together withZatanna,Phantom Stranger,Spectre,Doctor Fate,Flash (Wally West),Madame Xanadu, andGeo-Forceto try and undo the spells Circe had woven. Circe had expected this and planned on cultivating the energy from the spells the group was now casting—but her plan backfired, and her spells were undone: yet the war continued.[26]\nCirce had been betrayed by her allyKaslak. In addition to replacing the relics Circe needed for her spell, he also allowedPythiainto Circe's lair. Pythia managed to free her captured sisters as well asJulia Kapatelis. Wonder Woman met back up with Batman, who had recovered the Goblet, but told her that it was, in fact, a forgery that had been coated with some unknown material. Diana followed the trail back to Egypt, where she discovered the temple ofBana-Mighdallthat she thought had been destroyed. There she foundLobobattling Shim'tar. When some more Rogue Amazons arrived, Diana had Lobo fight them while she tackled Shim'tar, demanding to know what had become of her mother. After a tough battle, Diana managed to strike Shim'tar to the ground—only to unmask her and find that it was none other than Hippolyta.[27]\nNow the truth finally came together.Cheetahhad a confrontation with Edward Indelicato and explained the whole truth to him. While she had been in prison, Circe's minion Mikos came to her, transforming her permanently into the form of the Cheetah—although now, Minerva's mind remained fully in control. Circe was hardly benevolent, however, and insisted that Cheetah join herbeastiamorpharmy. Cheetah was to help Kaslak steal the proper artifacts for Circe to cast her spell. This included the Goblet, which Circle resolved to switch with a fake that would suit her own ends. She engaged the remnants of the Rogue Amazons, all part of a plot to discredit Diana and Themyscira. She also hiredDoctor Psychoto keep Diana distracted. When Hippolyta touched the fake goblet in Gotham, it transformed her into the new Shim'tar. Mikos removed Shim'tar from the building but failed to get the real goblet afterMaxie Zeus's assassins showed up, hired by Cheetah to try and double cross Circe. Philippus was attacked by one of the Rogue Amazons at the scene and witnessed Helene's death at the hands of the Cheetah.[28]\nTime was running out for Wonder Woman. She tracked down Hermes, but he was unable (or unwilling) to heal Hippolyta, so Diana resolved to take her mother back to Paradise Island. She was attacked en route by fighters, but with the help ofStarmanshe managed to evade them. On the shores of Paradise Island, she would face Circe at last. Circe had fought her way through Hermes to get to Diana, but she would not simply kill the Amazon and riskHecate'scurse. Cutting them off from other heroes gathered on the island (Starman,Hawkwoman,Aquaman, andDolphin), Circe used her magic to revert Diana back into the very same clay from which she was born. Having destroyed Wonder Woman, Circe departed, ready to grasp final victory. As the Amazons mourned their fallen princess,Supermanrallied Earth's heroes for the final battle.[29]\nDiana was not dead—not completely. Her soul was collected byPhantom Stranger,Spectre, andDeadman. They told her thatKlarion the Witch Boyhad been responsible for disrupting Circe's spells. Superman, meanwhile, led the charge against Olympus itself, where the confused Greek and Roman pantheons were still committed to destroying each other. When Circe's deceptions were made clear, she was transported back to the limbo realm where she had slain Hermes. There she foundDonna Troyand Wonder Woman—restored to life. Diana battled the evil witch, and this time her power was greater, for Hecate's power had left Circe. The witch was seemingly killed, but Hecate was denied Diana's soul. The gods decided to depart again, but the long war was finally over.[30]\nThe war had been costly. Much of Paradise Island was in ruins and would need to be rebuilt, and Menalippe and other Amazons had lost their lives. The United Nations, thankfully, fully exonerated Themyscira from all charges, and Queen Hippolyta was alive and well. Diana returned to the U.S. just in time to attend Vanessa's Junior High graduation.[31]\nWonder Woman is back\nWonder Woman was called to action bySupermanwhenBrainiacseized control ofWarworldand started to head for Earth. Superman decided that Earth could not wait for this invasion and had to launch a preemptive strike, so he recruited Diana and many of the world's other heroes.[32]WhileBatmangathered a team to defend Earth from any advanced warriors, Diana traveled with Superman and other heroes to Warworld to defeat Brainiac.[33]\nDiana spent some time withVanessaandJulia, until she learned fromEdward Indelicatothat theCheetahhad been captured in the Balkans, in a country calledPan Balgravia, by their new president, Baron Von Nastraed. Diana contacted the godProteusprior to leaving, enlisting his help to create a false identity,Diana Prince. Lacking knowledge of the region, she decided to enlistDeathstrokefor help. Inspector Indelicato decided to come along as well. The first location that they were led to turned out to be a trap and they had to fight their way through some royal guards. Capturing one, Wonder Woman used her Lasso to learn that the Baron had secret and dummy prisons set up all over—and he also had mass graves. Diana and Slade went undercover to the finest restaurant in the country, where they managed to meet the Baron and get him to agree to another meeting. On the way to the meeting, Deathstroke announced that he was parting ways, prompting a fight between he and Wonder Woman that she won. After tossing Deathstroke in the trunk of the car and having Indelicato stand guard, she broke into the Baron's castle. The Baron was not as naive as they hoped, however, and was waiting for her with several demonic thugs.[34]\nDeathstroke quickly recovered, however, and some of his \"friends\" showed up as backup. Wonder Woman was thrown in a magic cage but managed to force her way out.Barbara Minerva, reverted back to human form, was in the cell next to her, very weak from her long torment. She explained that the demon ruler needed a powerful female host for its mate. The Baron and his associate, Mr. Drax, began their demonic ritual as Deathstroke arrived on scene. As Wonder Woman fought the demon Drax, Deathstroke went after the Baron. Barbara, lapping up some spilled blood, reverted back into the Cheetah, and dove through the portal that Drax had opened, sealing it and destroying Drax in the process. The Baron vanished into thin air after Deathstroke plunged a dagger into him, and the nation was free again.[35]\nWonder Woman was prepared to testify at Indelicato's hearing, but no charges were filed against him. Outside the police station, Diana met a distraught woman who claimed her daughter had been kidnapped by her husband. The man in question got on the wrong side of some drug dealers who were shot and killed during a meeting he had with them, prompting him to grab a briefcase full of money (and his daughter) and run for it. The race was on to see if the police could catch up to him before mafiosi—but luckily, Diana made it there first, rescuing the little girl and preventing her from getting shot.[36]Meanwhile,Doctor Psychowas still on the prowl, and he used his powers to continue to torment Vanessa in her dreams.[37]\nWonder Woman in chains\nWonder Woman was approached by a man namedAsquith Randolph, the White Magician, for a mission that would take her into space, where she was needed to save the life of a female astronaut namedTashaon an experimental Russian spacecraft. When she was on board, Randolph detonated an explosive, and the ship was catapulted through space. Diana managed to get it under control, but they were still rocketing into the unknown. After drifting for two weeks through space, their ship was salvaged—but their rescuers were only interested in making them slaves. The slavers stripped them of their clothing and equipment and dropped them on a prison world—a prison world populated entirely by females calledHope's End. Tasha and Diana were bruised and battered—but not broken. They were prisoners on the planet for months, working in the quarries. AKhundprisoner frequently fought Diana. There was another prisoner, anunnamed Daxamite, who was kept in chains as a warning to the rest. After finally learning some of the other aliens' language, Diana learned their tormentors were called theSangteeand that they existed entirely as one gender for a century, then changed to the other. She finally managed to rally some of the other prisoners, destroying the Sangtee power station, capturing their starship, and freeing the imprisoned Daxamite. Taking up the role of a kind of space pirate, Diana worked hard, recruiting more ships and allies as she carved her way across the Sangtee Empire. One of her new friends created an artificial eye to replace one of the eyes the Daxamite lost. The new Daxamite was named Julia by Diana and she agreed to fight. Despite treachery from within, Diana was able to force a confrontation with the Sangtee emperor and get him (or her) to admit the folly of his people's ways. With some help from Julia, Diana finally was able to make it back home. Randolph had weaseled his way into the position of \"Hero of Boston\" during her absence.[38]\nWonder Woman after returning to Earth\nDiana did not return to Earth in time to prevent theDeath of Supermanor fightDoomsday. The monster tore throughJustice League Americabefore being put down by the Man of Steel—at the cost of Superman's own life. Diana gathered with past and present JLA members to mourn the death of their friend.[39]She held a place of honor during his funeral procession, and was one of the people who actually closed the lid on the sarcophagus.[40]Diana gathered with the Justice League at the Metropolis Post Office to read his fan mail as he used to every Christmas. While the heroes read some of them, she found a letter thanking him despite her house being destroyed by Doomsday, her husband divorcing, and she was financially ruined. Diana stated they should help her to repay Superman. She convinced her husband to take her back while Flash and Hal Jordan rebuilt her house.[41]The Justice League was in need of being rebuilt after Doomsday's rampage, so Wonder Woman agreed to come aboard as the new field leader.[42]\nDiana was shocked when she returned to Paradise Island to find it missing—the entire island was simply gone. Diana did not know what to make of it, so she went back to Boston and decided to get a job. Despite the fact that she was now leading the Justice League, and that she had apparently made a lot of money via merchandising thanks to Myndi Mayer, Diana resolved to look for a job in the classified ads. No one seemed interested in hiringWonder Woman. She eventually got a job atTaco Whiz, presumably so she could better understand the common man (and woman). She also got her own apartment.[43]\nDiana works at Taco Whiz\nDiana then met a man namedMicah Rainswho offered her a job (Rains was, according toEdward Indelicato, a total \"whackjob\") as a kind of P.I. TheWhite Magicianwas careful to always be close by, stealing the limelight. Diana continued her work at Taco Whiz while desperately trying to make a difference in some people's lives.Inza Cramer, the newDoctor Fate, finally reached Wonder Woman and offered her help at discovering what had happened to Themyscira. The two went back to the location of the former island, where Fate was able to use a spell to let them see events of the last few moments of the island. It seemed that a golden statue in Diana's likeness washed up on the shore. The Amazons brought it beforeHippolyta, but then something happened—a bright flash of light and an explosion—and the island was no more. Convinced her mother was dead, Diana knew thatCircemust be at fault. Doctor Fate was able to track her down, but when they arrived in Circe's lair, all they found were her remains—she was apparently killed in the same deadly spell she used to obliterate Paradise Island.[44]\nWonder Woman began to believe there was a connection between all the recent crimes that involved hi-tech gadgets. Diana began investigating. She also went out shopping withEtta Candyfor a wedding dress and after Etta passed out, she realized that her friend was starving herself to look thinner. While talking with Etta about it, theFlashshowed up, warning Diana about a hit on her and thatMayflywas the hitwoman. No sooner did he get out his warning when Mayfly showed up, guns blazing. With Etta and Flash's help, Diana managed to defeat Mayfly—but was shot in the process. While Diana recuperated in the hospital, Mayfly was murdered in her cell by an attorney named Donna Milton, who was working for Ares Buchanan, the supplier of the hi-tech arms and the one who hired Mayfly. Donna was carrying his child as well.[45]\nThe return of Ares\nDonna Milton then introduced herself to Diana, feeding her a tragic story of her life that caused Diana to remark \"nearly every terrible thing that can happen to a woman has happened to you.\" Diana was quickly taken in by the charming Donna. Ares Buchanan was, naturally, an avatar for the godAres, who was not so prepared to completely abandon the Earth. He had easily corrupted theWhite Magician, making him one of his lieutenants alongside Donna Milton. After weeks of friendship, Donna betrayed Wonder Woman to Ares. When Donna refused to let Ares torture her, however, he shot her and then prepared to shoot Diana. After a powerful spell from Ares, Diana was unable to break the chains that had bounded her. Donna, using one of Ares' weapons, created an explosion that left her and Diana plunging down hundreds of feet into a watery chamber beneath Ares' lair. The fall should have killed Donna, but they survived, and Donna went into labor. While Diana delivered the child, the White Magician contacted Ares's mafia boss, Sazia, letting him know that Ares Buchanan had died in the explosion, and they had to act quickly to hold his power together. Sazia was not interested, however, and attempted to shoot the Magician, so the Magician killed him instead.[46]\nThe White Magician, whose powers were increasing because of his connection to a demonic realm, began to transform some of his lackeys into supervillains. One of them,Dreadnaught, attacked Diana at the hospital—another attacked the Kapatelis' house, kidnappingVanessaand seriously cripplingJulia. Wonder Woman was able to save put a stop to the White Magician before more of his thugs could killEtta CandyandSteve Trevor. Her patience having run out, Diana contacted some of the mafia men connected to the Magician and warned them they had one hour to return Vanessa unharmed. When they failed to comply, Diana began to tear apart the gang, tracking down all of their outfits and demolishing them, leaving the words \"No quarter, no sanctuary\" as she went. Mrs. Sazia, the new head of the Sazia crime family, decided to betray the Magician to get Diana off their back. Diana found the Magician's lair and rescued Vanessa, but the Magician himself was not there.[47]\nCirce's manipulations are revealed\nDiana, plagued by nightmares, began to have doubt about her instability. She sought outSupermanand asked him to stop her if she ever got too out of control. Luckily,Doctor Fatereturned and told Diana that she had been having the same nightmares—dreams about the end of Themyscira. Replaying the spell that showed the end of the island, Diana guessed that maybe it hadn't really been destroyed—it was all a complex illusion created byCirce. Diana unveiled Doctor Fate, who was really Circe in disguise (or at least, an illusion of her). Circe revealed that she had not destroyed Paradise Island, but rather she had found a way to relocate it to a realm of fire where the Amazons had been fighting for their lives every day since their imprisonment. Circe offered to return the island—if Diana sacrificed an innocent life. She gave her until midnight. Battling through Circe's illusions, Diana was unable to save the life of a young runaway named Cynthia who was struck and killed by a car. With her death, however, Paradise Island was restored.[48]\nA contest to find a new Wonder Woman is announced\nDiana was elated—her home was back, her sisters were back, and her mother was back.Hippolytatold Diana the whole story of what had happened. Circe had led the renegadeAmazons of Bana-Mighdallto Paradise Island, stirring them up with dreams of conquest. They caught Hippolyta's Amazons completely off guard, and for two days there was nothing but bloody battle in the city. After it was too late, Circe's schemes became apparent. She used her magic to transport the entire island to another dimension, where the Amazons were set upon by demons. Both tribes of Amazons had to band together or die, and for ten years (in that realm) they fought against the demons. As a reward, Hippolyta bequeathed a section of the undeveloped part of the island to her sister's tribe. Now they were back, and the nightmare was over. Diana recounted everything she had done in the months since their absence—Hippolyta was not pleased. She felt Diana had wasted many opportunities to affect man's world as a whole. Hippolyta announced that she was not sure if she could trust Diana to represent the island anymore. Upset, Diana wandered away from the city with some friends, where she metArtemisfor the first time. Diana was intrigued, if not particularly impressed, with the brash, arrogant young Amazon from the tribe ofAntiope. As they were talking, word came that Hippolyta had made a decision—there would be a new contest, and perhaps a new Wonder Woman.[49]\nHippolyta meant to bar the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall from competing in the new contest, but she was overruled by a general vote among the Amazons. The Contest began, and Diana and Artemis quickly jumped out ahead. Artemis had to discipline one of her followers who tried to assassinate Diana during the middle of the Contest. Artemis did not think that anyone, but Diana could truly win, and that the Contest was merely a means of Hippolyta getting at her daughter, but she was determined to keep her honor. Hippolyta disclosed toPhilippusthat she had activated ancient magics, bringing to life monsters to battle the champions. Diana and Artemis were neck and neck during the last sprint—but distracted by seeing her mother ahead, Diana stumbled and fell. Artemis won the Contest—and the role ofWonder Woman.[50]\nArtemis, the New Wonder Woman, and Diana\nArtemis was given the Wonder Woman outfit to wear. She was also given theSandals of Hermes, which let her fly, and the Gauntlet of Atlas, which increased the strength of the wearer by a factor of ten. She also had her bow. Diana created a new black suit and headed back to Boston, too angry with her mother to listen to anything she had to say. Diana helped Artemis battle some minions of theWhite Magicianbefore visiting her friends in the hospital. Donna Milton was fully recovered, butJulia Kapateliswas paralyzed. Artemis went to New York City where a public relations firm picked her up, offering to make her a well-known presence. Artemis promised to succeed where Diana had failed. Diana had to help her friendMicah, who was in trouble again, before going off to helpHawkman.[51]Diana's teammates in theJustice Leaguedid not take kindly to the news that there was a new Wonder Woman. They refused to follow anyone other than Diana.[52]\nPoison Ivy and Cheshire attack Diana\nBoston was now caught in the middle of a gang war between the Sazia Family and the Paulie Longo family. Longo had the White Magician on his side, and all the beasts and creatures that came with him. Not to be outdone, Mrs. Sazia hiredCheshire,Poison Ivy, andCheetah. Diana was captured by the three villains. Cheetah, however, helped Diana escape, figuring she owed her one from their last encounter. Poison Ivy took out some of Longo's assassins that were coming for Sazia. The crime mistress was not safe, however, as theJokerhimself decided to come to Boston. Longo was displeased with the Magician's work, as it had failed to overwhelm Sazia. The Magician decided he needed to draw more power. Diana managed to track down Sazia and the Joker—who had a vest of dynamite strapped to him. The timer was a ruse, however, and it sprayed Diana with a paralyzing gel. Descending into the realm of the gods, Diana became one with the godPan, allowing her to shake off the paralysis and become (temporarily) almost as mad as the Joker and beat him at his own game. Meanwhile, Cheetah attacked the White Magician as he was preparing a spell to eliminate Sazia and Diana, causing him to miscast it and teleport them both away. Sazia managed to murder Longo before he got to her.[53]\nArtemis, frustrated and angry that the world had seemed to reject her, believed Diana was purposefully trying to disrupt her efforts as Wonder Woman. She tried to bring in Sazia, but the mob mistress evaded her. Diana, meanwhile, tracked down the Chauvinist and other thugs that Artemis had battled in her time as Wonder Woman. She discovered that they had all been hired by Artemis's agency, all for the sake of publicity, and managed to convince Artemis of this after a brief skirmish between the two. Diana decided she needed to go back home to get some answers from her mother.[54]\nDiana and Hippolyta have a falling out\nDiana found her mother in the woods, disciplining herself for what had happened between her and Diana. She confessed that when they were in the other realm, she had visions of the future—a future where Wonder Woman would die. This was the real reason she called for a new contest—a contest that she rigged, so that Artemis would win, become Wonder Woman and die while Diana would live. When Hippolyta said she expected Diana to remain with her while Artemis faced certain death back in Boston, an angry Diana responded, \"then you lost me a long time ago.\"[55]\nArtemis was in trouble—the White Magician was back but coming back from whatever realm he had gone to had changed him, transforming him into a powerful demon. He transformed Sazia and Cheetah into his minions and prepared for battle. As Artemis began a desperate struggle against the demon, Diana went first to the hospital. Her friends told her they thought she must have some kind of healing power—not only should Donna Milton and her baby have died in the explosion that killed Ares Buchanan, but Julia was almost completely recovered from her paralysis. Diana, however, realized the truth: Circe had been showing up, randomly attacking her before disappearing, with no rhyme or reason. Diana realized Circe had faked her death very well when she had gotten rid of Paradise Island—she had assumed another identity, Donna Milton, and hid her own mind so well in that other mind that maybe she did not even remember doing it. Diana interrogated Donna Milton, who denied this truth, not willing to accept it. But when Diana pressed her, Donna got angry and a spell teleported Diana to Artemis' side. The two Amazons fought together in a desperate, impossible fight against the White Magician, and his demonic pawns Cheetah and Sazia. When all seemed lost, Circe/Donna Milton appeared, and in a single burst of magic she disappeared, along with Cheetah and Sazia. Artemis, mortally wounded by the Magician, gave the Gauntlet of Atlas to Diana. With her strength thus amplified, Diana was able to put down the demon and then hold Artemis as she died. The two found peace in that last moment.[56]\nDiana is Wonder Woman once more\nDiana moved toGateway Cityto get a new start and began investigating some otherworldly technology—which led right toDarkseid, who captured Diana and brings her and a policeman namedMike SchorrtoApokolips. With the help ofMetron, Diana and Schorr escaped back to Earth. Diana learned that Darkseid was afterThemyscira. They got back after Darkseid had already invaded the island. Wonder Woman rallied her sisters to make a stand against Darkseid. The dark god called the battle off after a long hard fight. HisParademonscould be restored to life—the Amazons could not. Darkseid left the field, content with the damage done. Twelve hundred Amazons died, five hundred were injured. This meant that half the total population of Paradise Island had perished. Diana learned that her mother had left the island before the battle, stepping down as queen. Diana was offered the crown but declined and returned with Mike to Gateway.[57]\nIn Gateway, Diana got a job at a museum, working for the curatorHelena Sandsmark. She also met Helena's daughterCassandra. Cassie proved her penchant for getting into trouble early on, when she accidentally reactivated a golem that had to be put down. Diana was then approached by thePhantom Stranger, who needed her help to stop a recent plot byMorgaine le Fay. Morgaine was working withTheophilus Warlyand had captured theDemon(Jason Blood). She used her power to sick Etrigan on Diana, but Phantom Stranger managed to lift the spell and the three of them went after Morgaine in her lair. Next, she usedArion, enthralled by her spell, to attack them as they approached. Morgaine managed to capture them, and she hadVandal SavageandGeneral Immortusas well. Morgaine had planned on using their immortality to extend her own life and power, but Diana—having given up immortality upon leaving Themyscira—disrupted the spell. She battled Morgaine, who dissolved into dust.[58]\nA new hero calling himself Champion appeared in Gateway. Before Diana could meet him, she faced a new threat. When a scientist's young son was fatally injured in his lab, the scientist transferred the boy's mind into a computer system. Unfortunately, the boy thought he was actually playing a computer game and used his father's hard synthoid technology to create recreations ofBarry Allen,Sinestro, andDoomsdaywho all ran amok in Gateway. Champion joined the fray to help Diana, and then Cassie—making quick disguise and grabbing theSandals of Hermesand Gauntlet of Atlas—decided to assist, calling herselfWonder Girl, though here she just got in the way. The scientists managed to help Diana from the lab, even whenDecayshowed up and attacked them.[59]\nCassie was eager to prove herself as Wonder Girl and Diana was eager to train her—but her mother Helena emphatically rejected the idea. Cassie snuck out of the house, getting into a battle with Decay which almost ended in a stalemate. Diana, of course, showed up and defeated Decay. Meanwhile, back in Boston,Vanessa Kapateliswas still being plagued by nightmares because of her torment at the hands ofDoctor Pscyho—but at long last she was able to turn the tables on him in her dreams.[60]\nSoon afterwards, Diana helped out inThe Final Night, although aside from crowd control, her part was minor. After that, she got involved with some of the Earth's greatest heroes to stopKnow Man[61]In the wake of that, a group of aliens called theHyperclanarrived, promising to help turn Earth into paradise. Their cover was quickly broken, and they were discovered to be a group of renegadeWhite Martians. After helping defeat the Martians, Diana joined with the others to become a charter member of the new Justice League.[62]\nA series of minor earthquakes began to be felt worldwide. Three animal-men broke into the Gateway Museum, then escaped in a transparent aircraft. They later broke into a second museum, only to escape again. Diana and Champion, using a private plane of his, tracked them to Antarctica, where they discovered the ancient city of Lansinar far beneath the ice and were captured by its inhabitants. TheChallengers of the Unknownwere there as well. Thepeoplethere, living in darkness for 40,000 years, had no eyes, but their rulers—all of whom resembled ancientEgyptian deities—did. The rulers explained that long ago, theirs was an advanced city-state on a continent further north—but 400 centuries ago, the continent shifted to where it was, burying them beneath the ice (this timeframe would seem to correspond with the fall ofAtlantisas well). The four immortal rulers took the form of beast men, and they traveled to Ancient Egypt and helped them build their grand civilization—but they were no match for the coming ofAlexander the Greatand theGreek godsthat came with him. Some of the rulers were then imprisoned for centuries. Now they desired to return their continent to its proper place. Diana pointed out to them that their loyal followers could not long survive away from the home they had always known. The leaders decided to stay where they were, and they gave Diana aLansinarian Morphing Disk—a transparent object that could transform into anything she wished (like aninvisible jet). After they got back to Gateway, Mike Schorr expressed his attraction to Diana, but she told him she was not interested in him that way—she was also being hit on by Champion.[63]\nThe Amazons turned to stone\nIn the many weeks or months since Diana came to Gateway,Hippolytahad been wandering the city streets under the name \"Polly,\" befriending a few people but refusing to explain her origins. She had to be hospitalized, however, when her body began to change into stone. One of her new friends, a psychic namedAngelica, discovered who she really was. Diana, meanwhile, was searching for Mike Schorr, who had gone missing. She found him in the lair of a savage, feralCheetah. Attempting to strike Cheetah, Diana missed and struck a wall—only to have her hand shatter as if made of clay. Cheetah had made a deal withNeronduringUnderworld Unleashed—she had sold her soul in exchange for her assistantChumabeing restored to life. Unfortunately, with no soul in place, the base, savage aspects of the Cheetah began to overwhelm Barbara Minerva. With Chuma's help, Diana managed to revert Cheetah back to human form.Jason Bloodreturned to help Diana figure out what had happened to her hand. As Diana went over her whole history with Jason, she had a sudden feeling—a sense that something had happened to her mother. With Champion's help, Diana was able to find her mother—who had now completely turned to stone. Diana was fast turning that way too. Champion and her friends decided to take her home. Arriving on Paradise Island, they found the entire population of the city had turned to stone—all saveEudia, the Oracle, who had not yet fully turned. She said that what had happened occurred because the gods had left the Earth—but she pointed to Champion and revealed him to truly beHeraclesin disguise. In anger, Diana lashed out at him—and crumbled into dust.[64]\nThe Gods of Olympus restore Diana\nThe Greek gods reentered the scene. They called Heracles to their location and after he explained himself—saying that originally, he became Champion out of a desire for revenge but later fell in love with Diana—the gods realized that their departure from Earth is what triggered the Amazons reverting to the stone and clay from which they came. They restored Diana to life and ordered a hearing:JuliaandVanessa Kapatelis,Steve TrevorandEtta Candy, andHelenaandCassie Sandsmarkwere all summoned toOlympus. After the hearing, the gods decided to return to Earth, and with their return, the Amazons were restored to flesh. Before being sent home, Cassie managed to grab an audience withZeus, who decided to grant her wish of becoming a superhero.[65]\nDiana was gathered with Helena, Cassie andJason Bloodwhen a seemingly revivedArtemisstormed in, trying to kill Blood. Diana was forced to battle Artemis. She was joined in battle when Jason transformed intoEtriganand Cassie exhibited the new powers given to her by Zeus. The fight spilled out on the streets of Gateway. Hippolyta, who had returned to visit the friends she made from her wandering days, saw the fight—and Artemis—on television. She suddenly became terrified at the prospect of Artemis being alive again and feared for Diana's life. She and her entourage raced to the scene.Neronthen appeared on the battlefield and took all the parties present toHell. Neron split Jason from Etrigan, tormenting the former and Helena, whom he cared for, while forcing Diana to battle Etrigan. Artemis managed to free herself and Cassie and in the process, they found another of Neron's prisoners,Merlin. Artemis used the silver \"ornaments\" on her costume to injure Neron, but before withdrawing, the demon lord blasted Diana with a lethal bolt. Everyone was transported back to Gateway—with Diana lying an inch from death.[66]\nThe world feared Diana's death at the hands of Neron\nDiana was taken to the hospital.Donna Troycame, herself having just lost hersonandex-husbandin a car accident. One by one, the other members of theJustice Leaguearrived. They tried to heal Diana, but they could not, and she was all but dead. As her friends both in and out of the League kept vigil, her recovery looked bleak. Being incapacitated, Diana was not able to participate in theGenesisconflict, which involved not only the machinations ofDarkseidto controlThe Source, but also involved the evil of the war godAres—evil that nearly destroyed thegods of Olympusthemselves. Ares and Darkseid were both imprisoned on theSource Wallat the end of the conflict.[67]\nHippolyta, Donna Troy, and Cassandra had to rescue Diana from a rogue doctor who had hoped to transfer her own consciousness into Diana's body. It only confirmed what they had dreaded, Diana seemed truly dead. The gods intervened, however, answering everyone's prayers—Diana was resurrected, not just as a mortal, but as the new Goddess of Truth.Heratold Diana her days as Wonder Woman were over. Diana was uneasy in her new role, being told by her fellow goddesses that she could only aid those who called on her help. Meanwhile, on Themyscira, the Amazons decided that Hippolyta, having betrayed the trust of the island with her actions regarding Diana and Artemis, must be forced to do a penance: she must become the new Wonder Woman. This was made all the more possible by Hippolyta's augmentation thanks to her contact with the Source during the Genesis crisis.[68]\nIt was during Hippolyta's time as Wonder Woman that the \"true\" history ofDonna Troywas at last revealed. When Diana was a child, the Amazon sorceressMagalaused a spell to create a perfect duplicate of Diana to be her playmate. No one but the three of them knew. Six months later,Dark Angel, an enemy of Hippolyta's from when she traveled back in time, came to the island and kidnapped the duplicate, thinking she was the original Diana, and forced her to live a thousand different lives that all ended in tragedy. Thanks to Diana's intervention, Donna Troy was restored to life (with help fromThe Flash), but Diana was \"punished\" for her interference by being made back into a mortal again. Her mother eagerly stepped aside to let her resume her role as Wonder Woman.[69]\nCircereemerged, seeking revenge againstHippolytaand Diana. She used her magic to cause Hippolyta to forget who she was, resulting in Hippolyta thinking she was the wife of a man who had lost his. He thought she was his wife, and the same went for the man's son. Diana eventually broke through Circe's spell and reclaimed Hippolyta's memory, who then went back to Themyscira.[70]\nOne night,Oblivioncorrupted her Lansinarian Morphing Disk that started engulfingCentral City. The JLA came to know of the situation, and Superman decided to investigate it along with Batman. Bruce knew that Clark once had feelings for Diana and the two had wondered what would have happened if they had acted on it, also suspecting that his feelings might have resurfaced after her death. Diana meanwhile dreamed of having brought peace to the world. She did however so she could have at least a fleeting moment of love and thought her dream of peace in the world was a fantasy. Batman suspected that the disk responded to her deep desires. As the three are trapped by it, the disk plays out a dream of her and Superman falling in love and marrying while bringing peace to the world. In the dream, she is also introduced by him to Batman who she feels always sees the truth and becomes an important part of their lives. Batman confronts her and makes her realize that their desires are being manipulated. Though she doesn't want to break out of it, she accepts to do it after being made aware of the truth. Clark states that he never loved her, and they must go back to their lives. Batman assures her that she'll never be alone as they are there for her and the three finally break the disk's hold using her lasso.[71]\nThe ancient titanCronusemerged from the depths of time, desiring to be the new supreme god of all. He created a new pantheon for himself, and with his pantheon created a twisted doppelganger of Diana, the child villain known asDevastation.\nShe and Superman were transported toAsgardand forced to fight in a battle with the Norse gods against an army of demons for one thousand years. Even after a thousand years, when they were facing certain death and had no idea if they would ever get home. Although the two developed some romantic attraction thinking 1,000 years had passed on Earth, Superman remained faithful to Lois, Diana realized he would always love Lois and stated she understood, stating his eternal love for Lois was something that was perfect and not silly. The two were transported back to the time they were taken from in return for defeating the demon horde.[72]Superman met Diana again during Christmas tells him to spend time with Lois, who had been kidnapped and had been impersonated byParasitesince theY2Kcrisis, instead of focusing on Luthor being President, he gifts her a Mjolnir replica as a reminder of their time inAsgardwhich results in the two sharing a kiss.[73]\nLois also got an opportunity to talk with her in the form of a long interview that began with an around the world tour and that ended in a round of pool inSuicide Slum. Lois, having been jealous at times towards the Amazon Princess due to her closeness to her husband, took the opportunity to clear the air somewhat. She explained that it's difficult with Diana seeming so perfect and the whole world being convinced that the two must be an item. She gets a look into Diana's personal life and realizes that she's not perfect, but her highest quality is that she is able to love others despite their shortcomings. Lois also learnt about the war she waged with Clark in Asgard, but he only loved her, though Lois was disappointed that he never told her about their time there. Diana admits she had feelings for Superman and regrets not acting on it in past. She states that he is her best friend to which Lois replies that he is her best friend too. She maintains that the two of them are and will always be just close friends, regretting that she won't ever be so with Lois too because she hates her. Lois tells her she doesn't and assures that she respects and trusts her, leading to the two becoming close friends.[74]Diana later looks out for them both and often reminds Superman to go to her instead of remaining busy in his duties or in other things as the two need each other.[73][75][76]Lois was caring towards her at times as well, including when she underwent emotional problems due to Hippolyta's death or her killing of Max Lord.\nWonder Woman published a book, entitledReflections\nDiana began working as the Themysciran Ambassador to theUnited Nationsand moved into anembassyin New York. She fully embraced her status as a diplomat and a purveyor of peace, and published a book entitledReflections: A Collection of Essays and Speeches.Reflectionswas highly successful but garnered controversy over its content, particularly its mentions of the Greek pantheon and its progressive ideas. Diana's newfound position on the world stage earned her the envy of a wealthy woman namedDoctor Veronica Cale, who hated Wonder Woman, believing her to be unworthy of the powers she possessed. Cale began a campaign to oppose Diana, putting her immense wealth and power behind groups that spoke against Wonder Woman, and acquiring the villainsDoctor PsychoandSilver Swanin an attempt to use their powers to cause a riot among protestors at the embassy. Doctor Psycho used his mind-controlling powers to force a civilian to shoot the anti-Wonder Woman protestor, Darrel Keyes, while Silver Swan was set upon Diana to distract her. Wonder Woman was able to calm Silver Swan, and took Vanessa Kapatelis into the embassy in an attempt to treat her for the damage that had been done to turn her into the Silver Swan. Psycho, however, was shot on the orders of Cale.[77]\nMeanwhile,Aresset into motion a plan to replace his fatherZeusas ruler ofOlympus. He succeeded in creating rifts between thegods, resulting in a fight between Zeus andHerathat saw Hera cause great damage to Themyscira in her anger. Diana's attempts to restore Vanessa's health led her toLeslie Anderson, the business partner of Veronica Cale and a highly experienced surgeon. Leslie had previously supported Veronica's attacks against Wonder Woman, but she began to see Diana differently after meeting her and agreed to help treat Vanessa.\nDiana who spent a lot of time combat training against Batman alone together in the Watchtower, eventually developed a flirtatious relationship with Bruce.[78]After their fight withManitou RavenandTezumak, she noted he had broken a shaman spell to save her which wasn't possible with mere will, though Batman won't make his feelings clear.[79]When Justice League went into the past to saveAtlantisand Diana nursed him back to health as he was still delirious from time travel, she joked how she forgets he is human. But Bruce, before passing out, says he is an imperfect human who is beautiful, like she is.[79]The two kiss before being killed along with the rest of the JLA by theLeague of Ancientsand resurrected due to a repentant Manitou Raven and Kyle's sacrifice.[80]\nThe two decided to confront their feelings and set up their first date atWayne Manor,[81]but Bruce couldn't make it because he was crime-fighting.[82]They are however unable to find free time with each other and Diana finally decides to use theTransconsciousness Articulatorto examine her subconsciousness, seeing both good and bad dreams about their future. Eventually when they discussed their relationship together, Diana stated that she didn't want to risk their marriage though they had potential.[83]\nWith the help of Batman, Wonder Woman discovered that Psycho was responsible for Keyes' murder. Unbeknownst to Veronica Cale, Psycho had used his powers to impersonate a member of her security, and it was he who shot the security guard rather than the other way around. Psycho came back for revenge and tied up Veronica in a closet atCale-Anderson Pharmaceuticals. Wonder Woman happened to be visiting Leslie Anderson at the time, and managed to rescue Veronica Cale, though Psycho escaped.[84]\nWonder Woman's foe, the powerful witchCirce, was enlisted by theGorgonsto resurrect the legendary GorgonMedusa, who had been beheaded by the Greek heroPerseus. Circe succeeded in restoring Medusa, who immediately sought revenge againstAthenafor cursing her in the first place. Circe encouraged her to kill Athena's chosen champion, Wonder Woman, and informed her of another that hated Wonder Woman as much as she: Veronica Cale. Meanwhile, Doctor Psycho revealed to Diana that Cale was behind the resurgence of himself and the Silver Swan.\nWonder Woman battles Medusa\nMedusa traveled to the Themysciran embassy but retreated due to her horror upon seeing modern life. Her gaze turned a bird to stone, however, leading Diana to become aware of her existence, and she realized she would be forced to kill her. Diana attended a dinner party at theWhite House, which Medusa ambushed, turning dozens of guards to stone in the process. Wonder Woman fought her, but Medusa managed to escape and instead attack the embassy. Diana followed her and escorted her staff to safety, but Medusa's gaze turnedMartin Garibaldi, the son of Diana's employeePeter Garibaldi, to stone. Furious at Medusa's murder of a child, Wonder Woman was prepared to kill her, but refrained after Medusa invoked Ares and challenged Diana to a battle to the death. The punishment for ignoring such a challenge was torture lasting 1000 years, so Diana was forced to accept.\nVeronica Cale arranged for the battle to be televised, intending for the world to witness the death of Wonder Woman. Diana fought blindfolded in order to avoid Medusa's gaze, but Medusa managed to remove the blindfold and was about to turn Diana to stone. Wonder Woman quickly blinded herself using the venom of one of Medusa's snakes, and decapitated Medusa without the use of her sight.[85]\nThe GorgonsEuryaleandSthenoattempted to avenge their sister but were defeated by thePegasus, which sprang from Medusa's severed head. Doctors from Man's World and Themyscira were unable to restore Diana's eyesight, and she was forced to continue her heroics blind. Despite her lack of sight, Diana's skill in battle allowed her to hold her own in battle against theJustice Leagueduring an evaluation ordered by Batman.\nThe Gods of Olympus attempted to oust Zeus from the throne, causing him to unleashBriareos, the protector of his throne. Athena summoned her own champion, Diana, to fight him. Diana killed the beast by presenting the severed head of Medusa, turning him into stone. With Zeus' champion defeated, Athena took the throne of Olympus. After Athena's ascension to the throne, Zeus,PoseidonandHadesrequested Ares' help in overthrowing her and restoring the throne to Zeus.[86]\nWonder Woman, Wonder Girl and Ferdinand descend into the underworld\nAthena called upon Wonder Woman once more, requesting her aid in freeingHermesfromTartarus. Together withWonder GirlandFerdinand, Diana descended into the underworld. The trio foughtEmpusai, monsters guarding the underworld, and ventured into Tartarus until they discovered Zeus, Poseidon and Hades. Hades set the demonEurynomoson Diana, Cassie and Ferdinand, though they overcame him and discovered Hermes. Hades attempted to kill Diana but was interrupted by Ares, who betrayed the three gods, having agreed with Athena to deceive them in exchange for dominion over the underworld himself. Hermes was rescued and Poseidon and Hades were defeated, while Zeus submitted and returned to Olympus with the heroes.\nAfter their victory, Athena granted each of the heroes one gift. Wonder Woman wished for Martin Garibaldi to be restored to life, and Athena obliged. She also bound her own vision to Diana's, restoring her sight and granting her further empathy and wisdom.[87]\nWonder Woman fights Superman under the influence by Max Lord\nWhile under a psychotic episode induced byMaxwell Lord, Superman brutally beat Batman, though Diana tried to save him. She was frightened with the thought of him going rogue and was worried about Bruce whom she personally nursed back to health.[88]He later engaged in an all-out violent fight with Wonder Woman, thinking she was his enemyDoomsdayand Lois had been killed. Lord tried to mind control Diana but failed as she is immune to this kind of power. Wonder Woman put up a valiant fight with the Man of Steel, using her Amazonian skill, powers and intelligence to fend off the raw power of Superman, who by now was completely insane with rage. When Superman was stunned, she realized that he wasn't her real enemy and held back her attacks—sustaining more injuries as a result. She distracts him with him a flock of birds to get back to Lord and demanded that he release him. He refused and Diana cut Superman's throat with her tiara when he attacked again, thus making him realize he was fighting her. She demanded he free him from his control, but he mockingly replied that he will use him to kill his loved ones in the future and she'll have to kill him to stop it. Diana in response snapped his neck and freed Superman who was horrified.[89]\nThis action resulted in significant ramifications for Diana; her relationships with both Superman and Batman were seriously strained as they objected to her use of lethal force, no matter the circumstance.[89]Lois however stood up for her, stating she had no choice in order to save lives.[90]Bruce and Clark would only come to fully forgive her after the events of Infinite Crisis. The status of Wonder Woman amongst the other heroes and the public at large was uncertain as theBrother Eyesatellite (the deranged Artificial Intelligence controlling theOMAC units) broadcasted the footage of Wonder Woman killing Maxwell Lord, preceded by the word MURDER, to media outlets all over the world.\nWonder Woman snaps Maxwell Lord's neck, an action that changed the world's perception of her\nWonder Woman defended herself from several OMACs who attacked her in her own home. Having repelled the assailants, she was delivering an injured boy to the hospital when she saw a broadcast of the damaging video on the waiting room's television. She witnessed first-hand how people viewing the footage reacted with fear and revulsion; Brother Eye had managed to kill the faith the world had in her. At the start ofInfinite Crisis, Batman and Superman distrusted Diana: the latter could only see her as a coldblooded murderer, the former saw in her an expression of the mentality that led several members of theLeagueto decide tomindwipetheir villains. This hit close to home with Batman as his memory had been altered when he tried to stop the League from mind-wipingDoctor Lightafter the villain brutally rapedSue Dibny.\nTo make matters worse, Brother Eye, acting out of vengeance for the murder of Lord, initiated the final protocol, Truth and Justice, which aimed for the elimination of allAmazons. A full-scale invasion ofThemyscirawas set into motion, utilizing every remaining OMAC. Diana and her sisters, now isolated and alienated from the outside world, were forced to fight for their lives. The Amazons prepared to destroy the OMACs with a powerful new weapon, the Purple Ray of Death. However, Wonder Woman realized that Brother Eye was watching and transmitting, and that unleashing such destructive violence would only exacerbate the effects of her killing of Maxwell Lord. After the weapon was used once, Wonder Woman convinced the Amazons to shut it down. She then called uponAthena, who transported Paradise Island and the Amazons remaining on it to another dimension. However, Wonder Woman chose not to join them, and was left to face the OMACs alone.\nDiana Prince, secret agent\nOne Year Later,Donna Troyhad taken up the mantle of Wonder Woman, after a year in which Diana went missing. Diana re-appeared in the guise of Diana Prince, a secret agent. Batman had helped her create her new secret identity, while Clark had also suggested to him that he make her wear glasses. Diana joined theDepartment of Metahuman Affairsand was partnered withNemesis. During her introduction to the team, she was brought up to speed on the surveillance information available on Wonder Woman. Prior to dropping out of sight, Wonder Woman was last observed in the company of an eastern mystic namedI-Ching.\nWonder Woman asked lawyerKate Spencer(whom she knew to be the vigilanteManhunter) to represent her before the federal grand jury that was to determine if she should be tried for the murder ofMaxwell Lord(even though she had been exonerated by the World Court). With the help ofSasha BordeauxofCheckmate, Kate Spencer obtained a video of Wonder Woman killing Maxwell Lord which proved that Max was in control ofSupermanwhen she killed him. However, Wonder Woman would not allow Kate to use the evidence, as it would lead people to distrust Superman who she stated that the world needed. Upon concluding their deliberations, the grand jurors refused to indict Diana. The World Court then entirely dropped the charges against Diana for the killing of Lord.[91]\nOn Diana's first mission to save then Wonder Woman, Donna Troy, from a team of supervillains, she was joined byWonder Girl,Robin, Nemesis and the gods' new champion,Hercules. After revealing herself,Circestole their powers and Diana was betrayed by Hercules, who revealed he and Circe were the only gods who defiedAthena's edict to vacate the mortal plane. Circe then betrayed Hercules and de-powered him as well. Eventually, Diana's powers were restored, and she took the mantle of Wonder Woman again for the first time since handing over that title to Donna.\nDiana, Superman, andBatmanmet to re-form theJustice League. After a battle againstSolomon Grundy, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) andBlack Canaryoffered membership to those involved in the last mission. The JLA andJSAjoined forces when members of theLegion of Super-Heroeswerediscovered in the 21st Century.[92]\nDiana was captured and imprisoned by theDepartment of Metahuman Affairs, which was led bySarge Steel. She was tortured and interrogated to garner information that would allow theUnited States Governmentto build a Purple Death Ray like the one the Amazons revealed during the Infinite Crisis. Moments prior to the Amazon assault on Washington, D.C., Diana was freed byNemesis.\nCircetraveled to Themyscira and resurrected QueenHipployta. Hippolyta's first words were: \"Where is my daughter?\" Under Circe's influence, the Queen of the Amazons led an assault on the United States. After the attack, all Amazons who participated had their memories erased by thegodssave for Queen Hippolyta, who, freed from Circe's spell, lamented the destruction caused. A ban was also put in place that prevented any of the Amazons who were away fromThemyscirafrom returning, again save for Hippolyta.\nAround this time Wonder Woman was attacked by a combat unit of superpowered albinoGorilla KnightsfromGorilla City.Gorilla Groddplayed on the young gorillas' feelings of rage after encounters with poachers and trained and equipped them to be the ultimate combat unit, fit to take on the likes ofSupermanand Wonder Woman, and sent them to attack Diana. Diana talked them down and convinced them of Grodd's deceptive ways.Tolifhar, their leader, swore their service to her until tempers cooled enough for her to negotiate their return home to Gorilla City withKing Solovar. They moved into her apartment as a temporary measure.\nA group of Nazis who had been given abilities similar to those ofCaptain Nazitook advantage of Themyscira's empty state. When Wonder Woman encountered Captain Nazi on a mission as Diana Prince, she learned of their plans after defeating him and set out to thwart them, knowing her mother stood alone in Themyscira's defense. While Queen Hippolyta fought a one-person resistance campaign against the Nazis, Diana beseeched god after god from various pantheons for their aid in bypassing the ban and reaching Themyscira, but none were willing to faceAthena's wrath exceptKane Milohai. He agreed to adopt Diana as a champion and daughter, and gave her his standard, a cloth tied around her arm, as well as a seashell that could float in air and water, grow in size to carry passengers, and could travel between dimensions.\nWonder Woman faces the Circle\nWith the arrival of the Gorilla Knights and Wonder Woman, the Nazis, though powerful, found themselves in a fight they weren't ready for, and having already suffered in morale from the casualties inflicted by the Amazon Queen, they surrendered and withdrew from the island when faced with Wonder Woman's skill. While they were there, however, they freed four Amazon criminals. Once Hippolyta's personal guard, the Circle, led byAlkyonealong withMyrto,CharisandPhilomela, had been imprisoned ever since Diana's birth. They believed her to be a curse who would destroy Themyscira and attempted to kill her as a baby.\nThe Circle attacked immediately, inflicting wounds with god-forged arrows. They challenged Wonder Woman to singlehandedly face all four of them to retrieve her mother, who had been injured in the previous battles and whom they had taken. Three of them ambushed Diana and inflicted further wounds, though Wonder Woman defeated them. Diana confronted Alkyone and called her bluff on her willingness to hurt her Queen. Refusing to surrender despite being outmatched, Alkyone made one last desperate attack, then leaped into the sea. The other three members of the Circle were returned to their cells and remained unrepentant. Diana left the island once more, though several of her gorilla friends decided to remain behind on Themyscira with Hippolyta.\nThe Amazons fought in atonement when Earth was attacked by the Citizenry, a civilization of ruthless and powerful warriors who had wiped clean countless worlds and slain many champions and armies, including members of theGreen Lantern Corps. Diana found that their leader was once an Amazon claiming to be Hippolyta's sister who had been taken from Earth millennia ago and reshaped in their ways. Wonder Woman fought her and her daughter in orbit aboard their ships while the Amazons, assisted byAchillesand Diana's Gorilla Knights, defended Washington D.C., the center-point of the invasion. Hippolyta stayed in Washington D.C. to atone for the actions committed by her and the Amazons and helped to rebuild the damaged city alongside Achilles' men.[93]\nA short time later,Darkseidattacked and gained control of Earth. Wonder Woman was attacked byMary Marvel, who turned Wonder Woman into a \"plague vector\" for a new strain of theMorticoccus virus.[94]After this, Wonder Woman was turned into an enforcer for Darkseid and defended her new master's realm against the heroes of the Earth.[95]After Superman's return, Wonder Woman was attacked byFrankensteinand Darkseid's hold over her was lost. Regaining control of her actions, Wonder Woman chained Darkseid's body with her Lasso, allowing Superman to finally eliminate Darkseid's control over the Earth.[96]\nShe was one of the few heroes who attended Batman's private funeral and decided to hand his cape toDick Graysonthinking that it belonged with him. Unlike Superman, she was happy that Dick became the new Batman and carried on his legacy, later questioning Clark for trying to make him take it off.[97]\nMain articles:Blackest NightandJustice League: Generation Lost Vol 1\nWonder Woman as a Star Sapphire during Blackest Night\nNekron, the Guardian of Death, resurrectedthe supposed dead body of Bruce Wayneand released a swarm ofBlack Lantern Ringswhich attached themselves to heroes who had died and been resurrected by using Bruce as an emotional tether with them, making Wonder Woman aBlack Lantern. She grievously injuredMerawhile possessed but is able to resist from killing her and flees to an island. In her imagination, both Wonder Girl and Donna are killed. She also nearly kills Hippolyta but is stopped by Bruce.\nWhen each of theLantern Corpswere recruiting a deputy member for 24 hours, aStar Sapphire Ringattached itself to Wonder Woman and expelled the Black Ring from her after she kissed Bruce in a vision.Aphroditeappeared and told her that the ring recognizes she has a love for all creation. Diana states that she was not worthy of redemption after what she did to her family, but the goddess states that it was only her imagination and the island itself was created so her possession didn't harm anyone. The ring turned her into aStar Sapphire Corpsmember. She also subdued Mera, who had gone berserk due to theRed Lantern Ring, after peering into her heart. She was later turned into aWhite LanternbySinestrowho had fused withThe Entityand helped in defeating Nekron.\nThe Entity also resurrected some deceased people who had been resurrected by Nekron earlier. This included Maxwell Lord who had been killed by Wonder Woman long ago. The Justice League after finding this out, convinced the whole world to launch a manhunt for him. He decided to continue hunting her regardless. Using his psychic powers which had increased manifold since his resurrection, he mindwipes everyone and causes them to forget he ever existed, including Wonder Woman herself. OnlyJustice League InternationalmembersBooster Gold,Captain Atom,FireandIcewho were present at the same site escaped it.[98]\nWhen theBatman Familydiscovers that Bruce is alive and hurtling through time with enough built-up Omega Energy to destroy creation, Diana takes over the leadership of the League in absence of Superman, with whom contact had been lost while he looked for Bruce with otherTime Masters. She upgrades the alert level to black and has them prepare for Bruce's arrival.[99]He surprises them by arriving at the Watchtower and easily defeats everyone due to being infused with an Architect, only stopping so as to not harmRed Robinand her. After he starts regaining his memories due to them, he tells her to use the Lasso and learns he deliberately became an amnesiac so Darkseid'sHyper-Adapterwon't go after him and he deliberately brought it here. It however overtakes him and easily overwhelms Diana, but the Time Masters arrive to help her stop it. Bruce states this was his plan all along and successfully separates from it before having her and Superman sent back through time in a Time Sphere. He starts dying of the Omega radiation, but Diana and Superman are able to save him.[100]\nDiana discovers Themyscira destroyed\nDiana suddenly found herself in a new world with her memories mysteriously erased. In this altered world,Themyscirawas destroyed andHippolytawas killed, with the survivingAmazonsrelocating elsewhere and taking a young Diana with them. Diana grew up with no knowledge of what happened to her mother or her origin. Through meeting an oracle, Diana discovered Themyscira was attacked, and the Amazons slaughtered. She asked the oracle to show her how her mother died, and it was seen that Hippolyta sacrificed herself and killed herself in the fire as to not reveal the whereabouts of her daughter.[101]\nDiana helped to relocate other surviving Amazons after another attack was plotted against them with the purpose of getting Diana out in the open. Diana's odyssey brought her into conflict withThe Morrigan, two of a trinity of war goddesses related to the destruction of Themyscira:AnannandBellona. Diana was the target of a resurrectedMaxwell Lordwho discovered to his bewilderment that no one had ever heard of her. He switched targets but decided to keep hunting her. Only the four JLI heroes present at the site where he began his global mindwipe remembered her and they too were surprised no one else knew about her nor any record of her existed.[102]\nSupermanmeanwhile is left inLincolnby theSuperman Squad, knowing that she will be inspired by his actions to become a superhero. Diana watched him as he rescued vehicles from being swept away during a tornado. When he saw her flying away from the flood waters, she seemed familiar, but he didn't remember about ever meeting her. He asked her to assist him in saving other people and she agreed. While saving a woman, who was secretlyLisa Jennings, she was attacked by her. Lisa stated that she ruined her plan of making Superman see that one sometimes has to sacrifice a few to save the many. Diana in response punches her, but Lisa states that she should focus on rescuing the people instead as Superman asked. She flies away and rescues more people. Superman thanks her, though she informs him that she was just a warrior on quest for vengeance and only did it after being inspired by his heroic actions. She informed him about the woman who attacked her before leaving.[103]\nBlue Beetlewas able to remember her and Max Lord after his mind wipe was made ineffective due to the intense pain he suffered while Max tried to take off his armor. Bruce Wayne had also remembered who she was due to theWhite Lantern Ringand found out that she was in New York City. Someone had been slaughtering her fellow Amazons and she intended to find out who it was and refused when Batman tried to convince her to come with them.[104][105]As they were talkingOMACsshowed up, he realized they were hunting them to find her. They activated a teleportation portal, which took Booster, Beetle,Rocket Red, Ice, Fire and Diana toLos Angeles.[106]\nDiana and the other heroes were then attacked byOMAC Prime, deployed by Max Lord for murdering her.[106]Blue Beetle however is able to rescue her by injecting it with theBlue Beetle Scaraband taking control of it, before blowing it up. Maxwell was also forced by Captain Atom to undo his mind-wipe and make everyone remember about everything he had done.[107]\nWonder Woman fights the Centaur god\nThe Morrigan sent a series of warriors and monsters after Diana in order to try and shape her to become more like them so she could replace a fallen member of their trinity,Enyoand make the Morrigan whole again. A conventional force led by the same immortal who killed Hippolyta and now held the goldenLasso of Truthattacked a hidden Amazon temple. Diana's aid was enough to allow the Amazons to retreat and the attackers' leader was slain by her, avenging Hippolyta and returning the Lasso to its rightful hands. With it, Diana's own power increased, and she gained the ability to fly. The Morrigan's ruthless attacks did not end there, and even Diana's mentorPhilippusfell when the Morrigan sent the minor godCernunnos, aCentaurhuntsman, and aMinotaurafter Diana with the intent of driving her further into anger and hatred.\nThe Morrigan then took three fallen Amazons and imbued them with the spirits ofArtemis,Giganta, andCheetahand turned them against the enclave of Amazons that sheltered Diana. Against the might of the three warriors, the Amazons were defeated, and all were slaughtered, while Diana herself was badly injured. She escaped death thanks to the unlikely aid ofDoctor Psycho, whose powers allowed him to realize the timeline had been altered.[108]\nUsing his psychic abilities, Psycho showed visions of alternate timelines of Diana's life. He explained that she could become Wonder Woman, but it would have to be something she chose to be, and said he'd rather be part of her life, even as a villain, than part of the current state of the world. Diana was taken to a hospital where she quickly recovered. There she met an elderly patient at the hospital, one of theFates,Clotho. Clotho explained that she had given Diana a 'backup' fate, so that if hers was severed she would survive and be able to fight back against the forces who had done so, and that was Diana now. The fate then gave Diana a cloth she had spun with a blue and white star-pattern similar to her pre-Odyssey outfit, which Diana donned as a cap as the Amazons with the spirits of Artemis, Giganta, and Cheetah returned.\nFinding her strength had increased once more, Diana easily defeated the three empowered Amazons, and convinced them to surrender and join her to avenge all of their comrades rather than follow the Morrigan's way and die. The three Amazons joined Diana in attacking the Morrigan, however things went badly as a mystical sword stabbed Diana, transfixing her in place. The other three died to the Morrigan, though in turn, Bellona died at the hands of their own warriorAjax, who had been freed by Psycho. This left only the strongest, their leader Anann. Diana was shown a vision of what could happen if the Morrigan's plan for her succeeds, and she saw herself clad in green, wielding theFlashing Bladeand standing at the head of an army of the dead. In her vision, Diana was marching over the Earth with a cause of justice untampered by mercy and slaying even her friends in theJustice Leagueincluding Batman,Martian Manhunter,Green Lantern, and finally dispatching Superman himself after he tries to stop her.\nAs the vision ended, Anann began torturing Diana with her powerful magic to force her to give in and join the Morrigan, but while doing so she overlooked that her powers had not quite killedArtemis. The badly burned Amazon regained her bow and shot the goddess in the neck, causing Anann to lose the ability to release her magic, which resulted in her exploding. In the rubble of their building, Diana grabbed her Lasso which led her back to the door where the vision had come from, but before she passed through, she was met by theGods of Olympus, who told her what happened; they were in exile out of fear ofNemesis, a goddess gone mad. Knowing that within her own realm, only the strongest heart could hope to stand against Nemesis, they tasked Diana to succeed where they could not.\nA battle of two Wonder Women\nClimbing through the doorway to Nemesis' realm, Diana fought through constructs in the shape of the dead, only to meet something unexpected holding the other end of her Lasso; herself, wearing her traditional uniform but also holding the Flashing Blade, who attacked. As they fought, it became clear the other Wonder Woman was stronger, and she chided Diana for talking instead of acting. Diana attempted to break through to her with words, but the other Wonder Woman cut her with the Flashing Blade, giving Diana a vision once again.\nDiana discovered through the vision that before the Odyssey began, the Morrigan were gathering an army to attack Themyscira, and Wonder Woman had confronted the three goddesses. However, this was a lure by the evil Nemesis, Goddess of Retribution. Wonder Woman fought the three Morrigan, causing the death of Enyo when she was thrown into the path of a blow from Bellona that was meant for Diana. As the other two pressed the attack out of anger, Nemesis herself came forth and attacked the already worn Wonder Woman, impaling her with her Flashing Blade—identical to the one the false Wonder Woman carried. The blade bestowed upon Diana not death, but instead allowed Nemesis to steal her life, her form, and her power and take them on herself. Only thanks to the meddling of Clotho did a sliver of Diana's consciousness escape from this event, and the new timeline was forged.\nBack in the present, Nemesis explained that while her power was sufficient to fend off foes in her realm, she needed to scour humanity of its valor and bring its greatest warrior to heel, so that she could bring vengeance upon all who deserved it and end humanity. With Wonder Woman defeated and her passion for justice bent to vengeance, nothing would be strong enough to stop the mad goddess' retribution. Diana rebuked that living among mortals didn't make her hate them, but Nemesis said it didn't matter and Diana would become part of her now, impaling her with the sword once more. Using Clotho's strand of fate, however, Diana freely merged with her old self and power, casting the spirit of Nemesis out and declaring herself Wonder Woman once more. Wonder Woman denounced Nemesis' plan as a mad scheme, saying that the soul of an Amazon could never be bent to her merciless hate, and she would never be her champion.\nDeclaring Diana's death, Nemesis attacked once more in her own body, but this time Wonder Woman was strong enough to resist; she was not only unwounded, but with her new strength added to her old. Nemesis transformed by calling upon the strength of all murdered souls who cry out for vengeance, but Wonder Woman seized her own sword and slew her with it. As Nemesis died, she revealed that Diana had passed a final test and expressed joy that she would be freed in death; the cries of the murdered would no longer roar in her ears, while Diana would take her place to mete out punishment, and if Diana would not be her champion, she would take up her wrath and become the new Nemesis. As Nemesis died, armor reminiscent of the armor in her first vision covered Diana, and the truth of Nemesis' words sank in, as Diana felt the pain of the unjustly killed that had driven Nemesis mad over thousands of years and it filled her with her terrible strength. However, also within Diana's heart still resided the memories of those who loved her and turned to her for protection. Wonder Woman declared she would take Nemesis' place and be the new wielder of the Flashing Blade, but would also be its last wielder, as she broke it over her knee.\nWonder Woman after the Odyssey\nWith that, the spells and changes of fate on the rest of the world were broken, and Wonder Woman suddenly found herself on Themyscira, intact and whole, again, in the way of an archery contest between Artemis and Philippus. She rushed forward and hugged Philippus, then ran off to see her mother, leaving the two Amazon warriors confused. Diana met Hippolyta and the two talked, Diana discussing the Odyssey she had been through while ignoring the League business for a while. She also commented that she could feel there wasanother changecoming, but Hippolyta reassured her that whatever change was to come, Diana would remain her daughter, they would remain Amazons, and Diana would always be Wonder Woman. Holding the words with her, Diana then flew off into the sky. She soon rejoined the League after returning.[109]\n\nMain article:Wonder Woman Recommended Reading\n\n\nBlack Lantern CorpsmemberThis character is or was a member of theBlack Lantern Corps.

This progenitor later merged his essence with a massive computer network and became known asComplex-Complex.[1]Over the span of centuries, the ruthlessly aggressive, intellectually stilted Citadelians took control of world after world, beginning with Okaara. Because of a ban on the Vega System imposed by theGuardians of the Universe, the Citadel was allowed a free hand in its expansive goals without interference by theGreen Lantern Corps.\nVarious dictators arose to power during the Citadel's reign, but Complex-Complex was always the true power. Such rulers included LordDamyn,Komand'r, and the opportunistic Earth humanHarry Hokum. Their reign ended in theCitadel War, when the revolutionaryOmega Mendestroyed the Fortress Ring that served as the defensive grid for the Citadel Homeworld. The Omega Men's interim leaderTigorrdetonated an explosive charge that destroyed Complex-Complex, severing all communications between the various Citadelian factions. With this single action, the Citadel War was brought to to an end, though many fringe elements of the Empire continued to exist.[2]\nThe surviving Citadel supreme commander and his aide Harry Hokum succeeded in capturing several members of the Omega Men in the weeks following the war. Those who were still free aligned themselves with the interstellar bounty hunterLoboin an effort to free their comrades. The Citadel commander and Harry Hokum intercepted the Omega Men during the breakout, at which time the Citadel supreme commander was killed by Lobo. In order to quickly solidify his position, Harry Hokum assumed control of the fringe elements of the Citadel and entered into an agreement with Omega Men leaderPrimus. The pact stipulated that a New Citadel Empire would be allowed to thrive unobstructed so long as the worlds under its charge participated willingly. Those who refused to become part of the new empire were invited to join the New Vega coalition. The prison planet upon which this accord was reached was renamedNew Alliance.[3]\nTheBranxWarriors,Spider Guild, theChangralyniansand theGordaniansresided under Hokum's command in that star system.\nThe Citadel also became part of a galacticAlien Alliancebent on the invasion and subjugation of the planet Earth led by theDominatorsduringInvasion!.[4]\nOne yearafter theInfinite Crisis, the Citadel made a surprise raid onThanagar, seeking to disrupt the reconstruction efforts from theRann-Thanagar War, for unknown reasons.[5]Vath SarnandIsamot Kol, the Green Lanterns ofRannand Thanagar (respectively) were able to drive them off, but were only able to pursue them to the Vega system.[6]\nRecently, the Guardians repealed the Vega ban, as part of the ongoingWar of Light, allowing the Green Lantern Corps to begin operating within the system.[7]It is not yet clear how this will affect the Citadel's expansive intentions.\nTransportation:* Interstellar Starships.[4]Weapons:* Photon Guns and Homing Space Mines.[8][2]"

Without the parts and repairs he needs to remain functioning as a cyborg, his molybdenum cells that hold the promethium keeping him going have begun to deteriorate, and he may not make it much longer.\nDonna is interrupted in her monitoring by an upsetKole, whose nascent relationship withJerichois not going as well as she hoped it would. Sighing, Donna suggests that Kole simply beherself, and let Joey find a way to let her know he's interested,ifhe's interested. Thankfully, Kole commends Donna on helping everyone so much, but Donna's somewhat embittered by the fact that the only person shecan'tseem to help isherself, missing Terry terribly.\nBack in Central City, the Doom Patrollers realize that they couldn't have simply beenflownout of their planet - they had to have beentransportedsomehow.

Whether they want to or not, they will have to fight.\nAs Beast Boy and Cyborg are working on installing a power source for the city's generators, the Doom Patrol attacks, claiming the plant as their own. Soon, the other Teen Titans come to their aid. While in battle with Cyborg,Rampagewarns that he has seen something that makes him think they should reassess their attack. AtDoomsday's command, they retreat, leaving the Titans wondering what their intentreallywas. They didn't seem towantto kill anyone. Still, Victor is injured, and it angers Dick enough that he agrees to draw up war plans with Starfire.\nRampage explains that the clear fact is that some mutual enemy broughtbothcities to this planet against their will fromdifferentearths. And despite their retreat, Rampage did locate the power source - it was the promethium powering the cyborg. If they want to get home, they have to dismantle the Cyborg. It will ensure the deaths of the Teen Titans and the destruction of Gotham, but it is a necessary sacrifice.\nAfterwards, Dick and Kory are obviously on the outs, and Donna urges him tofacetheir differences and work through it. Angrily, he reminds that Kory almostkilledpeople today. Donna tries to remind him that Kory's people live by their emotions, and herlovefor him will keep her on the right path. Dick admits that he isn't sure that he and Kory should have got married at all, and he immediately understands that he's hurt Donna's feelings, asshecan't even be with the oneshemarried.\nAs the Doom Patrol plans its attack,Firehawksteps out and secretly sends a message to Nightwing, begging to talk.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nConcepts:\n\n\n\n"

It eventually came to pass, withNekronunleashing theBlack Lantern Corpson the universe.\nTheBook of Oa, a sacred text of theGuardians of the Universe, contains a prophecy called \"The Blackest Night\", which states:\nThe Guardians refer to this prophecy as the last and hidden chapter of the Book, describing their final fate and ultimate purpose because they did the forbidden - they felt fear.[2]\nThe Final Prophecy?\nAbin Surinitially uncovered this prophecy and was forbidden to speak of it.[3]Ganthetcalled theSinestro Corpsinvasion of Earththe second verse of the hidden chapter, with the Blackest Night itself being the third and final verse. He also acknowledged, however, that even the Guardians themselves did not know exactlywhattheBlackest Nightwas.\nDuring theSinestro Corps War,Ganthetand a female Guardian namedSaydare banished from the council for feeling emotion.\nJust asParallax(now back in his monster form) attacks the Lanterns for freeingKyle Rayner, Ganthet and Sayd arrive and draw Parallax into four separate lanterns (Hal,Kyle,John, andGuy's, respectively). As Ganthet explains, he and Sayd were kicked out of theGuardians of the Universe. Ganthet's final act as Guardian is to make Kyle a new power ring. He asks if Kyle is willing to downgrade himself to a normal Green Lantern, which Kyle quickly agrees too. The four men then take their lanterns and hearing theSinestro Corpsoath, recite the classic Green Lantern oath, and depart to confront the Sinestro Corps.\nGanthet and Sayd also explain to the four about theEmotional Spectrumcreated at the start of sentience that is separated into 7 colors:green (willpower),yellow (fear),violet (love),red (hate),indigo (compassion),orange (greed), andblue (hope), each representing different forms of emotion, with green being in the center and balancing the energies. The further towards one end of the spectrum an energy color is, the more diffiuclt its power is to control, leading to a corruptive influence over the user. Ganthet also reveals that in the coming future, each color will have its own forces like the Lantern Corps, and these forces will fight against the others in aWar of Lightacross the universe that will lead into the event known as \"The Blackest Night\", the worst of the hidden prophecies of theBook of Oa.\n\"Seven corps will be at war.\"\nIn the aftermath of the war, the Guardians decide to bring the second of the new laws into effect. After realizing that the \"Blackest Night\" prophecywillcome to pass, Ganthet and Sayd depart after creating aBlue Lantern Ringwith the intention of creating their own Corps. TheAnti-Monitorfinds himself on a dark planet and is trapped by an unknown force in aBlack Lantern Central Power Battery.\nAt the end of the Sinestro Corps War, Ganthet and Sayd are currently living on an unknown planet calledOdym, where they harness the emotional blue energy spectrum of hope and make plans to create another intergalactic police force in order to aid the Guardians and theGreen Lantern Corpsin their upcoming battle against \"The Blackest Night\" by creating bluepower ringsandbatteries. Both Guardians have evolved into two new beings, capable of bringing hope to others and each other, as they are also apparently romantically involved.\nLong ago, when the rogueManhuntersrampaged throughSector 666, Atrocitus was one of only five beings in the entire sector to escape death. He and the other four survivors formed a terrorist cabal known as theFive Inversions, bent on the destruction of theGuardians of the Universeand all who served them, and with Atrocitus serving as their leader. The Five Inversions performed a ritual which allowed them to peer into the future and discover the prophecy of the Blackest Night, which decreed that all life in the universe would end.\nAfter Abin Sur began making periodic visits to the planetYsmault, where the Five Inversions were imprisoned after the Guardians destroyed theirEmpire of Tears, he began to ask questions regarding the Blackest Night. Sur even went so far as to free Atrocitus from his imprisonment so he could lead the Green Lantern to Earth, the birthplace of \"the black\" that would end the universe. Caged in Sur's starship, Atrocitus instilled fear in Sur, allowing theyellow impurityto seep into his willpower constructs and weakening them enough to escape. After slashing the Green Lantern in the chest, mortally wounding him, Atrocitus jumped from a point high in Earth's atmosphere to escape Sur's failing ship.\nWilliam Hand's parents run a coroner's/funeral home, the logo of which is the same symbol William will adopt at the beginning of his criminal career. At the time a teenager, Hand was shown as having a severe preoccupation with death and the dead, including implied necrophilia. His energy-absorbing weapon is now portrayed as being built byAtrocitus, a fervent enemy of theGuardians of the Universe. He comes to Earth to seek out the being who will bring on the events to be known as the Blackest Night. This being is revealed to be William Hand. At this moment, is it revealed how these changes will affect later events in Hand's life, including the details of his career as Black Hand.\nWilliam Handwakes up in a grave on Earth. He \"hears\" death speaking to him. He walks throughout the graveyard discovers that he is at the Hand Family Mortuary, his childhood home. Upon entering, he kills his two brothers and mother, saving his father for last. When his father asks \"Why?\", Hand replies, \"Because this is what I do.\" before killing his father. Hand then commits suicide and is resurrected bythe Scarred Guardian, a Black Lantern, and tells Hand that he is the sentient embodiment of death, much like howIonand Parallax are the sentient embodiments of willpower and fear respectively. Hand then heads towardsGotham City, with Scar at his side.\nAt the grave ofBruce Waynein Gotham City,Hal JordanandBarry Allenreflect on Batman'sdeathand how the hero community is avoiding linking Wayne to Batman.\nThis reflection turns to the pair looking at their own deaths, comparing the sadness that Barry's engendered in others while Hal's produced anger. Hal sums it up by telling Barry, \"I died a sinner. You died a saint.\" The conversation moves on to the world becoming \"more dangerous\" after Barry's death and observing that the deaths ofArthur CurryandJ'onn J'onzzcost the Justice League its \"heart and soul\". As they leave the cemetery, Barry expresses hope that their dead comrades will be returned to them. He specifically cites Batman noting, \"If there's an escape, you can bet Batman's already planning it.\"\nBlack Hand approaches the grave saying \"Yes. This one.\" He then pushes his hand through the ground in front of the headstone and forcibly extracts Batman's skull. He then begins to recite:\nThe Blackest Night falls from the skiesthe darkness grows as all light dieswe crave your hearts and your demiseby my Black Hand - the dead shall rise!\nInterspersed with this are scenes of the headstones ofRalph&Sue DibnyandRonnie Raymond.\nWhile reciting the oath, Black Hand's ring begins to glow and swirl as light shines in the eyes of the skull he is holding.

Atrocitus recognizes it at his homeworld and then attacks Ganthet and Green Lantern, wrongly blaming them for the devastation of his home by theManhuntersand causing the Blackest Night to happen, and we find out that he once valued life before he succumbed to the rage of theRed Lantern Corps. They find that the Black Lantern Battery is no longer on the planet Ryut. So, in order to find out its location, the lanterns recite their respective Corps oaths and recharge their rings, except for Larfleeze who does not have an oath for theOrange Lantern Corps.\nMeanwhile onEarth, Barry, and the rest of Earth's heroes converge onCoast City, where they are joined by Hal and the other Lanterns. The Lanterns then combine their rings and destroyScar, and turn their attention to Nekron and theBlack Lantern Central Power Batteryand unleash their powers on the Battery, but it has no effect on either the Battery nor Nekron, who then reveals the next stage of his plan.Black Handthen resurrectsBatmanwho spits out Black Power Rings while Nekron explains that he was behind every resurrection and they are all still connected to him.Superman,Kid Flash,Superboy,Wonder Woman,Green Arrow,Animal ManandIceare transformed into Black Lanterns with Barry and Hal fighting away the rings. Barry and Hal try to escape not only the black rings meant for them, but the resurrected heroes that were just transformed into Black Lanterns by Nekron. In order to escape the black rings, Barry has Hal throw him a construct of a line, and runs both of them two seconds into the future, preventing the black rings from targetting them. The Lanterns then realize that even with their combined powers, they are only recreating a fraction of the white light necessary to destroy Nekron and the Battery. So, in order to bolster their ranks,Ganthetinitializes a program in Hal's ring, which duplicates it. Ganthet attaches the duplicate on to his hand and inducts himself into theGreen Lantern Corps. His last act as Guardian is to initialize the same program in the other power rings to deputize individuals for 24 hours, citing that though each ring is different from each other, they are all based on Oan technology. While Ganthet himself is the Green Lantern Corps deputy, the other duplicate rings seek out beings capable of their respective emotions to serve as a temporary member for each Corps, Saint Walker's ring attaches itself toFlash, while Larfleeze's ring goes toLex Luthor. Sinestro's ring goes tothe Scarecrow. Atrocitus's ring attaches itself toMera, while Indigo-1's staff welcomesthe Atominto theIndigo Tribe, and Carol's ring attaches itself toWonder Woman, which frees Diana from theBlack Lantern Ringattached to her and brings her back to life. In order to fully recreate the white light, Ganthet has Indigo-1 and her tribe bring all the members of the other Corps to Earth, so that they can destroy Nekron and theBlack Lantern Corps.\nBack onOa, theGreen Lantern Corpscontinue to battle theBlack Lantern CorpsandGuy Gardner, who became a Red Lantern after Kyle died. Kyle and the other Lanterns try to get through to Guy to free him from the red ring's influence, but Guy thinks it's a trick by the Black Lanterns and uses both theRed Lantern Ringand theGreen Lantern Ringattached to him to attack his friends. Suddenly, the Green Lantern planetMogoarrives, on an old order given to him by theGuardians of the Universeto use his planet's gravity to suck any infestation on Oa on to his planet and destroy them. Mogo increases his gravity to suck everyone, including theGreen Lantern Corps, theBlack Lantern Corps, and Red Lantern Guy on to his planet. He disposes of the Black Lanterns by drowning them into his core, and destroys them permanently. As for Guy, he immerses him in a nutrient bath, which removes the toxic effect of the red ring from his body, freeing him from the power of the ring. Now that the Black Lanterns on Oa have been destroyed, the Green Lantern Corps, along with Miri Riam, theIndigo Tribe, and the members of the other Lantern Corps, who then teleport to Earth, where they helpJohn Stewartdeal with the Black Lanterns from space, including the dead planetXanshi.\nAsGreen Lanternand the other Lanterns continue to battle theBlack Lantern Corps, they are attacked bythe Spectre, who goes after Hal and nearly turns him into a Black Lantern.GanthetandSaydfree him, but are themselves eaten by the Spectre, but Hal frees them. Hal and Ganthet then create a construct of a stake and drive it into the Spectre, but it has no effect on him. They then realize that the realSpectreis trapped inside the body ofCrispus Allen. Hal then has Ganthet summon his Power Battery, as well as Guy's, Johns' and Kyle's batteries as well. He then tells the others that the only being capable of beating the Spectre isParallax, and that if he joins with the parasite again, then they will beat the Black Lantern Spectre, and separate him from Parallax right after that.Sinestrodisagrees with Hal, saying that he joined with Parallax because Coast City was destroyed, but Hal says that he has made peace with that and has Sinestro use his ring to destroy the four batteries and release Parallax. Hal and Sinestro then fight with each other over who gets to bond with Parallax, but Hal wins in the end. But, before he heads towards the entity,Star Sapphirecomes over to him and kisses him, saying that she loves him. Hal then joins with Parallax, and we see him in the same uniform he wore when he first joined with Parallax. With the increase in power, Parallax battles the Spectre while the others fight against the Black Lanterns around them. Parallax then goes inside the Spectre's body and finds the real Spectre, and theBlack Lantern Ringcontrolling the body of Crispus Allen. Parallax destroys the ring, which turns Crispus Allen's body back into a corpse, releasing the realSpectre. The Lanterns attempt to free Hal from Parallax, but Parallax fights back, not wanting to separate again from Hal Jordan. Ganthet and Carol manage to pull Parallax out of Hal. Sinestro tries to bond with Parallax, but something pulls Parallax away and he disappears. The Spectre tries to destroy Nekron, but since Nekron doesn't have a soul and is death itself, the Spectre has no effect on him and transports the Spirit of Vengeance away.\nInCoast City,NekronhasBlack Lantern Supermankill a Guardian.Black Handthen uses the blood of the Guardian to draw a symbol on the ground. Then, Nekron says, \"Trespasser. RISE.\" A being of white light then comes out of the ground, to whichGanthetsays is the sentient embodiment of life itself, meaning that the Guardians lied when they said that life began onOa, when it actually began on Earth. Nekron then begins to attack the Entity, causing pain in every living being.HalandSinestrorealize that the Entity is likeParallaxandIon, it needs a host. Hal heads for the Entity, but is stopped by Sinestro, saying that Hal had his chance with Parallax and that he himself will continueAbin Sur'smission, and bonds with the Entity, who says, \"Thaal Sinestro of Korugar. Destiny Awaits.\"\nInthe last issueof the Blackest Night event, we see Sinestro in a White Lantern uniform and begins attacking the Black Lanterns around him. As he's bonded with the Entity, he sees the history of life, from when it was created on Earth at the beginning of the universe, to when the first living beings began to feel emotions, creating theEmotional Spectrum. Suddenly,NekronkillsSinestro, by slicing him in half, trying to draw out the Entity, but the Entity heals Sinestro, who resumes his attack, this time going after Nekron himself. Meanwhile, in space above Earth, the seven Lantern Corps continue to battle the Black Lanterns coming fromXanshi. In order to destroy the Black Lanterns, the Lantern forces go into Xanshi's core, where they see a fusion ofBlack Lantern Ringsat the core of the planet. They then use their rings and destroy the connection, thus destroying the planet once and for all, as the members of the Lantern Corps head down toCoast Cityto defeat Nekron and destroy theBlack Lantern Central Power Battery.\nNekron manages to separate the Entity from Sinestro, but before he can continue his attack, Hal bonds with the Entity, bringing theAnti-Monitorback to life, which destroys theBlack Lantern Central Power Battery. The Anti-Monitor starts to attack Nekron, but his powers have no effect on him. Nekron then counterattacks and transports the Anti-Monitor back to theAntimatter Universe. Hal also turnsSuperman,Wonder Woman,Superboy,Green Arrow,Ice, and all the resurrected heroes that Nekron turned into Black Lanterns, into a White Lantern Corps. Hal and the White Lanterns then attack Nekron and destroy him. Hal then uses the White Lantern Ring to resurrectBlack Hand, who coughs up a number of white rings, which attach themselves toOsiris,Jade,Captain Boomerang,Hawk,Ronnie Raymond,Professor Zoom,Maxwell Lord,Hawkman,Hawkgirl,Martian Manhunter,Aquaman, andDeadman, bringing them back from the dead.\nAfter the battle, we seeHalandBarryatBruce'sgrave. Barry is wondering why the Entity resurrected only the specific people that it resurrected, instead of everyone who died. Hal tells him that he doesn't know, but tells him that because he bonded with the Entity, he can feel it in space, as the Blackest Night ends and theBrightest Daybegins, as we see a White Lantern Power Battery in a crater. AndBlack Handwith theIndigo Tribe, in chains.\nThis story line ran in concert withBlackest NightthroughGreen Lantern(Volume 4)andGreen Lantern Corps(Volume 2).\nAs part of the theme of the event, DC brought back, or \"resurrected\", nine titles that had previously been cancelled for a single issue.

That new state of affairs was exactly what Roy needed to rebuild his life, and those of others. With a grant from theWayne Foundation, he helped place a lot of families who had lost their homes. But now, it's been a year, and he is startled by the sound of a voice coming from beyond the dome. It warns that the dome will soon fall, and champions from all of the cities collected on the surface of the planetTeloswill have to fight each other for the survival of their people.\nConcerned, he calls his friendsStarfireandDonna Troy, who confirm that with the dome's disappearance, they have regained their powers. As it turns out, though, Roy used his Wayne grant formorethan just building his shelter. He also built an armory, to watch over the city in the troubled early weeks of the city's confinement. He had told himself it was all to make the loss of his daughterLianworthsomething.\nUnfortunately, none of the heavy-hitters of Gotham City can be reached by Roy, and he soon receives a call from Kori and Donna that whatever the voice beyond the dome was warning about, it'sstarted. From afar, he identifies the group attacking Gotham asThe Extremists- dangerous killers. Kori and Donna must face them alone, and Roy knows they won't be able to last much longer without help. Reluctantly, he retrieves the cybernetic arm he built himself, promising himself that this is how he can make Lian's loss meaningful.

Banished from Tamaran, Koriand'r was enslaved and experimented on, granting her extraordinary powers which she used to lead a rebellion and liberate herself and her fellow slaves from their captors. She became known throughout the cosmos asStarfire, and settled onEarth, where she became a member of the superhero teams theOutlawsand theTeen Titans.\nPrincess Koriand'r was the youngest daughter born to the First House of Tamaran. She lived a happy and peaceful life until her home planet was attacked by the alien conquerers, theCitadel, who operated under the orders of the evilDominators. The Citadel killed Kori's family, with the exception of her older sisterKomand'r, and enslaved the entire population of Tamaran, including Kori. They appointed Komand'r as the leader of Tamaran, seeking to use her as a figurehead to appease the planet's people. However, in an attempt to take away the people of Tamaran's will to fight back, they forced Komand'r to publicly banish her sister from the planet.\nKori was taken by the Citadel and was the subject of numerous painful experiments at the hands of thePsions. She was discarded in Takron, a savage prison populated by aliens from the various planets the Citadel had conquered. The Citadel suspected she would perish quickly, but she survived motivated by her rage. After lashing out against a Citadelian guard offering sympathies, Kori projected huge amounts of energy from her body, and realized the experiments conducted on her had unintentionally given her incredible powers. She was restrained and further experimented on, enslaved and drugged to keep her compliant.\nEventually, Kori was forced to work on a slave ship called the S.S. Starfire, where she met Orn, a rebel Citadelian who had been enslaved by his own people. He showed Kori kindness and love, and smuggled food for her. She began training in secret with Orn, and eventually managed to empower the slaves on her ship to overthrow their captors, leading a rebellion that freed the aliens from their captors. Kori took control of the ship she had been enslaved upon, liberated the people of Tamaran, and became known throughout the galaxy asStarfire.[1]\nShe traveled to Earth, where she became a member of theTeen Titansand lived inTitans Towerfor a time.  Over time, she developed an affinity for fellow TitanDick Grayson, and the pair began an relationship.  Eventually, through an ostensible betrayal by Komand'r, Tamaran was destroyed, resulting in a great deal of guilt on Koriand'r's part, as she blamed herself for not stopping her sister.[2]\nKori lived on Earth for some time and used her powers to fight for justice, before suddenly losing her memories. She found herself in her alien ship on an island in the Caribbean, not knowing how she had got there. She lived solemnly until she discovered an injuredJason Todd, who had washed up on the island's shores. Jason reminded Kori of her former loverDick Grayson, and she decided to use her ship's Tamaranean technology to nurse him back to health. Jason told her of his history as Robin and his superhero identity as Red Hood, and the two quickly grew fond of one another.\nStarfire during her time with the Outlaws\nJason lived with Kori for a short time until he learned thatRoy Harperwas scheduled to be put to death as punishment for protesting inQurac.[3]Jason requested Kori's help in rescuing him by slaughtering his pursuers, and Red Hood and Starfire succeeded in their mission. The trio traveled back to the Caribbean, and Kori and Roy began a sexual relationship. They later decided to band their efforts, forming a mercenary team called the \"Outlaws\".[4]\nOne of the team's earliest adventures led them to encounter an alien hunter namedCrux. Crux had targeted Koriand'r after discovering a photograph of her on the internet, and wanted to drain her powers away and gain them for himself. Starfire was attacked by Crux, who used Tamaranean technology against her in attempt to strip her of her powers.[5]He failed to do so, as Starfire had grown resistant to the technology after the experiments she had undergone by the Citadel, though Crux did severely wound her in the process. Kori was rescued by Arsenal, who managed to fend off Crux while she gathered her strength. Together they overpowered the alien hunter, and Kori was about to kill Crux until she and Roy were forced to retreat after Jason arrived, followed by an angry mob who were intent on chasing him.[6]\nThe team traveled toGotham Cityto rescue civilians who were being held hostage in Gotham General Hospital by Jason's former adversarySuzie Su. Shortly afterwards, their ship intercepted a message sent fromAlfred Pennyworthto theBatman Family, which explained that theCourt of Owlshad sent multiple Talons loose across Gotham where they were targeting forty people of interest. The Outlaws decided to stay and help, and attempted to protect one of the Court's targets:Mister Freeze.[7]Starfire and Arsenal were tasked with keeping Freeze safe, while Red Hood pursued the Talon that had been sent for him. The heroes managed to defend Freeze and delivered him toBatgirlbefore they left Gotham.[8]\nKoriand'r pilots the H.M.S.S. Starfire once again\nKori was awoken to a visit from her friend Orn, who had helped her overthrow her captors when she was a slave. Orn informed her that Tamaran had been taken over by theBlight, a parasitic alien race, and requested she return to her former role as the former commander of the H.M.S.S. Starfire to defeat them. Orn teleported Starfire, Red Hood and Arsenal to the ship,[9]however Kori was hesitant to rescue her people once again, feeling that they had never attempted to help her. Roy convinced Kori to fight the Blight, but he was eventually captured by members of the alien race, forcing Starfire to return to her home planet.[10]Kori successfully rescued Roy and was reunited with her sister Komand'r, who had been forced to work with the Blight to stay alive. The two tearfully reconciled and worked together with the Outlaws to take on the Blight.[11]They succeeded in protecting their home planet, and Komand'r offered Koriand'r the chance to join her on the throne and rule Tamaran together. Kori kindly declined her offer, choosing to return to Earth with the Outlaws instead.[12]\nAs later stories established that Tamaran was destroyed prior to the events of this story, it is possible that this story has been removed from continuity, or that this was a new world colonized and renamed Tamaran in its honor.[13]\nKoriand'r later found her home planet of Tamaran from being invaded again, this time by theHelspont. When the Outlaws arrived on the planet they discovered that Komand'r had sided with the Helspont in order to ensure the safety of her people and had ensured that Tamaran was spared. Koriand'r was devastated to learn of her sister's apparent betrayal, however, Komand'r heard her sister's pleas and betrayed Helspont, destroying him and nearly killing herself in the process. This led Kori and Roy to break up - though purely out of necessity - as Koriand'r was forced to return to Tamaran to ensure that Komand'r could get the medical attention she needed. The two shared a kiss, and Koriand'r promised to remember Roy for \"forever and a day\".\nLike with the incident involving the Blight, as later stories established that Tamaran was destroyed prior to the events of this story, it is possible that this story has been removed from continuity, or that this was a new world colonized and renamed Tamaran in its honor.[14]\nStarfire would eventually return to Earth and started to live in Key West, a small island town. She desired to experience a normal human life and appeared to have no interest in heroism or her former life. She befriended the local Sheriff,Stella Gomez, who helped her find a place to live and constantly dealt with Kori's naiveté regarding human culture. Kori also got to know Stella's widowed brother, Sol (who happened to bear a striking resemblance to Dick Grayson), and later began dating him. Starfire later metAtlee, a waitress who was secretly a super-powered woman from a civilization living below the Earth's surface. Despite no longer wanting be a hero, trouble continued to find Kori in her new home and she was forced to defend Key West from various threats. After a trip to Atlee's home, Starfire decided that she should once again use her powers to help others. She left her friends in Key West and tried her hand at being a hero once again.\nInspired by her earlier life as a slave, Starfire had begun investigating a human trafficking ring going on in the East Coast. She managed to locate the base of the operation on an island, but while talking to a person who had information she needed, she was knocked unconscious by an unknown person. She awakened in an unknown location surrounded by the other young heroesBeast Boy,RavenandKid Flash. The identity of their captor was revealed to beRobin, who kidnapped Koriand'r and the others with the intention of creating a new team of Teen Titans.[15]Damian then reveals that Ra's Al Ghul has sent a team of assassins after them.\nStarfire alongside Team Mystery\nBrainiaclaunched an attack against Earth, focusing his forces on theJustice League,Suicide Squad,Titansand theTeen Titans. The heroes were captured and divided them into mis-match teams to fight theOmega Titans, who had emerged after theSource Wallfell. Starfire was drafted intoTeam MysteryalongsideSuperman,Sinestro,Starroand theMartian Manhunter. As the newly formed teams gathered, and whilst Brainiac was informing them of the situation, his head suddenly exploded.[16][17]\nAfter Brainiac's death, the teams traveled toColuin order to receive the Tree of Wisdom, Tree of Entropy, Tree of Mystery and the Tree of Wonder. Starfire found her planet,Tamaran, in Colu's World Nursery alongside multiple other worlds stolen by Colu. The planet was attacked by the Omega Titan,Wisdom. It was destroyed, despite Team Mystery andTeam Wonder's efforts. As the Omega Titans arrived onEarth, the teams and theGreen Lanternsworked together to draw them away from Earth. Due to these events, Starfire left the Teen Titans to go to theGhost SectorwithCyborg.[18][19][20]\nStarfire joined theJustice League Odyssey, a team formed to bring order to the newly created space sector known as theGhost Sector.\nThis section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject.

They took local reptiles for testing and discovered one part of the lizard's mind had the potential for much greater complexity. They enhanced the creatures and found the new developments were passed to each succeeding generation. The reptiles were released back into the wild to chart their survival rate.\nThe Maltusians eventually left their world in a great exodus. The enhanced life forms evolved into the Psion race. The early Psions investigated the Maltusian labs and mimicked their creators. They went as far as cutting off their tails to look more like the Maltusians (and as a result, disavowing their original background). After several millennia, the Psions left Maltus to follow their creators, now known as theGuardians of the Universe, who were onOa.\nWhen the two discovered each other, things were not quite what the Psions expected. The Oans regretted their decision not to destroy their equipment before leaving Maltus. The Psions were forbidden to travel to Oa, though they wished to learn more from the Guardians. Though the Psions had mastered the technology, they had gained little understanding. The Guardians felt responsible for the Psions and sent them to theVega system, where they could strive for comprehension. The Guardians ordered the Psions to stay within their assigned area so the Guardians would not be disturbed, as the system was off limits to the Guardians and theGreen Lantern Corpsforother reasons. The Guardians hoped the Psions would achieve their own greatness in time. The Guardians' great hope has not yet come to fruition.\nDiscovering their creators and then feeling humiliated, the Psions buried the truth about themselves. As a species, they forgot their background and began anew their scientific work. But as scientists, the Psions asked the questions all thinkers ask: \"Where are we from?\" The Psions never stopped asking this question. Again and again, the Psions discovered the truth about their origins, and every time they ended up suppressing the knowledge. The Psions refuse to acknowledge to themselves that their creators did not want them nor believe in them. When hearing the truth, in pain, they go into shock and incapacitate themselves. This process also suppresses their knowledge of their genesis.\nThe Psions maintain vast floating laboratories where studies continue, often with a sadistic relish with wagers taken on the findings. There they exploit the lifeforms they found in theVeganstar system.  Working with their science, they created the many species of Vega's twenty-five worlds, subconsciously replicating their own origins. Active against them are theOmega Men, an interstellar group of rebels drawn from the Vegan worlds. In their research, the Psions gaveX'Halvirtually supreme power, which she ultimately used against them. The Green Lantern Corps is still barred from entering or interfering within Psion designated space; however the Corps and its masters, the Guardians, are now considering removing that restriction.\nOne of the Psion experiments involved attempting to synthesize the bio-replication powers of theCzarnians. They maintained a laboratory on an unidentified asteroid in the Vega star system. Years after the experiments had been abandoned, the Omega Men came to the asteroid and inadvertently activated the Psion experiment, duplicating the Omega Man known asTigorr.[1]\nThe Psions also attempted to see how much energy aTamaraneanbody could hold before their bodies combusted and exploded with the overload, experimenting on PrincessKoriand'rand PrincessKomand'rofTamaran. The two escaped the Psions' clutches, but not before absorbing so much solar energy that they gained the ability to shoot energy from their hands, known asStarbolts.\nA small contingent of Psions were captured and enslaved by an alien race known as theH'San Natall. It was the H'San Natall's intention to seed the planet Earth with various sleeper agents whose bodies would be genetically modified to harness great power and fight against Earth'sMetahumanpopulace. The H'San Natall enslaved a number of Psions and put them to work bringing their plans to fruition from a laboratory on the moon ofTitan. For sixteen years, the Psions monitored the progress of eight genetically altered humans, one of whom,Audrey Spears, was raised in a virtual reality chamber onTitan. Audrey, and three other of her fellow seeds, escaped Titan with the help of the (now teenage) hero known as theAtom. Kidnapping a Psion scientist named Dorek, they returned to the world of their birth and became the second group of young heroes to call themselves theTeen Titans.[2]\nIn later years,Green LanternsKyle RaynerandGuy Gardnerplanned to breach Vegan space in order to retrieve recruitSoranik Natu. The mission was successful, though the Guardians expected the Psions to react to the incursion into their territory. More recently, the Guardians repealed the ban on the Vega system, allowing the Green Lanterns to operate with the system. The Guardians anticipated that the Psions would react with hostility to this.[3]\n\n\n"

Koriand'r's birth to theroyal familyof the planetTamaranwas an occasion of great joy to all but her older sister,Komand'r, who, born sickly and thus unable to fly like her peers and judged unfit to rule, deeply resented her new sibling. As the girls grew older, Komand'r became more and more wantonly cruel, even as their father led Tamaran's forces against the invading warships of theCitadel, first planet of the Vegan system. Eventually Komand'r and Koriand'r, together with youngsters of the various Vegan worlds, were taken to be trained in combat by theWarlords of Okaara. The training culminated in a duel between the two sisters in which Komand'r cheated and disgraced herself, nearly killing Koriand'r, who nevertheless saved her sister's life. Komand'r then defected to the Citadel, revealing Tamaran's defense secrets and instigating a series of devastating attacks on her homeworld in which millions were killed. Finally, a truce was called on condition that Koriand'r be turned over to the Gordanians, the Citadel's lizard-like allies, as a slave. After six years of torture, hardship, and degradation, the future Starfire was brought before her sister, even as the Gordanians were attacked by the Psions, ancient enemies of the Citadel and consciousness scientists devoted to experimenting on other life forms. Koriand'r and Komand'r were captured by the Psions, who attempted to learn the secret of their race's ability to fly by means of solar energy. Counterattacked by the Citadel during the experiment, the Psions left the two sisters shackled to a device channeling solar power through their bodies, with the result that both gained the power to fire powerful star-bolts from their hands. Koriand'r escaped and freed her sister, only to be blasted and returned to the Citadel as a captive for her trouble. Eventually, she made her getaway toEarth, where she joined the Teen Titans. Their vacation at an end even as Starfire concludes her story, the Titans drink a toast to their friendship before returning home.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\n"

The first princess born in over a hundred years, she should have been courted and showered with honors. On the day she was born theCitadel Empireattacked and destroyed the western Tamaranean city of Kysarr, killing three thousand citizens in her name. Though she was in no way at fault for what had happened Komand'r was for all time inextricably linked with that terrible day. To make matters worse, Komand'r had been stricken with a childhood illness that left her unable to harness ultraviolet light to fly as most Tamaraneans did. Komand'r grew up hated by the Tamaran population, who denied her birthright and refused to allow her to be the next Princess of Tamaran. All of her queenly privileges, honors, and celebration were later given to her younger sister,Koriand'r. Komand'r's rage grew inward, and whenever she could, her hatred for her planet was focused on her hapless sister.\nKomand'r's rivalry continued and intensified when the siblings were sent for combat training with theWarlords of Okaara. Things came to a head during a sparring exercise in which Komand'r attempted to kill her sister. As a result, she was expelled. Komand'r swore vengeance and joined the Citadel, quickly rising through their ranks to becoming a traitor against her own people and world. Komand'r later betrayed her planet with detailed information about Tamaran's defenses to the the Citadel. They conquered Tamaran with ease, and the surrender conditions included the enslavement of Koriand'r. Koriand'r was also never permitted to return to Tamaran, since it would mean the Citadel would devastate the planet for Tamaran's abrogation of the treaty.\nKomand'r was made her younger sister's ruler and made the most of the bondage with years of horrific servitude and torture. When a furious and humiliated Kori killed one of her rapists, Komand'r decided to execute her as punishment, but before getting the chance, the sisters were attacked and captured by thePsions. The Psions, largely a species of sadistic reptilian scientists, performed a deadly experiment on both of the sisters to see how much ultraviolet energy their Tamranian bodies could absorb until expiring from the excess. Before the procedure could be completed, Komand'r's Citadel forces attacked the Psion ship to rescue her.  While the Psions were distracted, Kori broke free with the newly developed  starbolts, which were circular blasts of bright green-colored ultraviolet energy directed from her hands, which were a result of the Psions' experiments. Against her better judgment, she decided to free Komand'r, who was absorbing more and more ultraviolet energy. However, far from grateful, Komand'r struck her sister down with the same, much stronger blast of light purple-colored ultraviolet energy and had her restrained for later execution. Kori escaped and stole a space ship to escape to planet Earth, where she met a group of five superheroes and helped form theNew Teen Titans.\nThe would-be successor to the throne went on to work with the same Gordanian slavers who imprisoned and torment her and Starfire as she came of age. Working as a forced labor Templar who twisted and experiment on future members of theOmega Menover the decades she worked with them. Eventually tracking down her younger sibling to earth in an attempt to resell her back into slavery on theCitadel Homeworld. But not before Forcing the recaptured Koriand'r to watch as her Gordania vessal's defenses took apart her rescuers, the Teen Titans bit by bit in an attempt to save her. While stationed with the citadel, it's torture technicians wasted no expense in putting her sister through unbearable amounts of torture while she dined withLord Damyn, relishing in their capture of both her wayward sibling and the Tamaranian goddessX'Halat the hands of Okaaran Warlords within their ranks. What she didn't count on was it being a cleaver trap set by both the Titans and Omegans in order to infiltrate their base of operations.\nWhen the Teen Titans entered into the citadel throne room, Komand'r threatened to unleash the maddened and murderous godess X'Hal upon them all lest they surrendered. When titan's memberCyborgtook Damyn as a hostage, the two factions were caught in a mexican standoff, one which was expediently broken by the treacherous Blackfire who summarily killed Lord Damyn herself in order to commandeer his throne and empire. With this change in events Starfire's friends tried their hand at appealing to Blackfire in the hopes of going free, the latter of who laughed off such negotiations gloating that she soon moved to raze Tamaran to the ground with her newfound armada.\nIn a fit of rage Starfire Attacked her leading to a brutal fight where she well nearly overwhelmed her demented assailant. But before the fighting could be further escalated however, aPsionemployed within the citadel opted instead to mitigate a battle to the death between the two hateful rivals. Within a jungle on their home planet of Tamaran, where they fought both for their lives and rulership of theCitadelempire. Using cruel psychological tactics in order to gain a temporary upper hands, Komand'r quickly found herself outmatched by her younger sister in the contest as it dragged on. Going so far as to break the rules of which in an attempt to murder her fellow combatant that much quicker. She again found her underhandedness backfiring as Starfire took off into a crazed flight pattern, first smashing hard into the side of a mountain and then taking a nosedive into a nearby waterfall stream. Having had enough of the conflagrations, Komand'r attempts to used her starbolt power again only to be boiled alive in the rapids causing the rocks surrounding it to violently explode. Blackfire was then assumed to be deceased afterwards.\nBlackfire had survived nearly drowning in the falls but was left blinded by the incident, Komand'r's life was spared when her warrior lieutenant and loverDor'ionsaved her. For many months the two retrained her until she regained her killer instinct, readying to resume her crusade for the throne. Eventually exceeding expectations for her final test and having regaining her eyesight in the process, at the cost of her mates life. The death of her beloved and the mutual love they shared eventually spurred her back into the path of the conqueror, a drive she both lamented to've lost after her fateful encounter with her sister and her team, as well as cursed due to putting it before all else, even love. Eventually moving on to incite a civil war on her home planet of Tamaran in an attempt to usurp her father,Myand'r's throne by inciting rebellion within the populace.\nWhen the Omega Men and Kory's friends, the Teen Titans intervened. Blackfire attempted to have them fight each other to the death, but this was undone whenJerichomanaged to see through her plans, possessing one of the Omegans in order to see through her veiled trickery. Moving on she decided to launch a full scale invasion against the capitol city, a campaign which lead to the successful domination of Tamaran as well as the capture and imprisonment of titans Nightwing and Jericho not to mention her brotherRyand'rand her sister Starfire was to be forever exiled.\nKomand'r returned as the leader of small group of surviving Tamaraneans, pledging allegiance to Thanagar. It was, however, all a ruse to gain more power and once again have a planet to settle on. She was working behind the Grand Mor's back all along. She killsHawkwoman. This greatly angersHawkmanand in return, he reperforms the initial operation the Psions performed on Komand'r to take her powers away.\nBlackfire returns once again, somehow having regained her powers. She wants to take the planet ofKranaltine, now known as New Rann, for her people, but instead settles for an alliance withVril DoxandAdam Strangeand agrees to take only a certain portion of the planet for her people. Later on, a romance develops between Komand'r and Vril Dox. When Vril Dox is kidnapped byStarro, everyone expects Blackfire to seize the moment to take the planet, but instead she demands to be taken to battle and help rescue Vril Dox.\n\n\nThis character has been primarily an enemy of theTeen Titans, theTitans, or any of the other variousTitans incarnations.

It is the eighth planet in the Vega system[3]and the home world ofStarfireof theTeen TitansandDarkfireof theOmega Men.\nTamaran is populated by a race of golden-skinned humanoids who are descended from a feline race and who worship the goddessX'Hal. Many thousands of years ago, the Tamaranean race either migrated or was brought to Tamaran from the neighboring planetOkaara. As they made the world their own, the Tamaraneans established a planetary government that evolved into a feudal society. Each landmass was ruled by a royal family, under the dominion of which exist smaller city-states ruled by influential families.\nThe Tamaraneans are a passionate people driven more by emotion than reason. While they are unusually fierce warriors, their capacity for love is even greater than their capacity for hate; as a result, war and strife were for many centuries long forgotten on Tamaran. Instead, the people channeled their energies into creating a tropical utopia, a paradise where they could live in harmony with the wildlife and where battle skills were maintained largely for ceremony's sake.\nUnfortunately, with the rise in power in the Vegan system of the bloodthirsty race called theCitadel, Tamaran was eventually reintroduced to war. Tamaran re-outfitted its armies and, led by the royal house of King Myand'r, managed to fend off a Citadelian invasion for more than an Earth century. Tamaran's defenses, however, were finally breached when Myand'r's daughterKomand'rdefected to the Citadel and revealed crucial military secrets. In the ensuing battle, millions of Tamaraneans were killed; the entire race would have been annihilated had not KingMyand'rruefully negotiated a solemn truce, the signature of which involved sacrificing his other daughter,Koriand'r, to the slavers of the Citadel.\nDespite this truce, Tamaran's troubles were far from over. The citizens of Tamaran saw the sacrifice of their beloved Princess Koriand'r as a tremendous act of weakness on Myand'r's part and instigated a worldwide civil war. Komand'r returned and in spite of the intervention of Koriand'r - now known as Starfire of theNew Titans- she successfully usurped Myand'r's throne. During this time, Komand'r seized control of Tamaran, with her parents acting as her advisors. Koriand'r returned to Earth.\nLater, Komand'r had come to realize that it was her own hate that made her despise the world that had spurned her. Using her abilities, Komand'r helped to free Tamaran and stopped a terrorist invasion. Komand'r ruled Tamaran justly and honorably, with both a warrior's fist and a queen's heart.\nStarfire later returned to Tamaran, after a savage attack by an evil version of her teammate,Raven. Upon her return, she met and fell in love with a man namedPh'yzzon, a general in the army. After a quick courtship, Koriand'r and Ph'yzzon married.\nMeanwhile,Victor Stone(formerlyCyborg) had merged his consciousness with the alien race known asTechnis, in an effort to save the dying race. Cyborg was reunited with his former teammates as an evil version of Raven tried to destroy her good soul, which lay dormant in the body of Starfire. To ferret out Starfire, evil Raven incited a conflict in the Vegan star system.\nThe Tamaranean fleet - led by General Ph'yzzon - fought valiantly, but they were overwhelmed. Knowing they couldn't stop thePsions, Ph'yzzon alerted King Myand'r and Queen Mother Luand'r of the situation. The two called for an evacuation plan, to save as many Tamaraneans as possible. However, they themselves decided to stay on the planet, to man what ground defenses remained. But they were no use. The attack by the Psions caused the core of Tamaran to implode, consuming the entire planet and whoever remained on it. As a result, Tamaran was destroyed along with the Technis.[1]\nThe Titans were able to destroy the evil Raven completely and restore the good Raven into a new spiritual golden body. Starfire decided to rebuild her culture on a new planet, the moonJalascis, with the surviving Tamaraneans. This world was dubbed New Tamaran.\nWhen the planet-consumingSun Eaterravaged the galaxy, New Tamaran lay in its path. An alien woman namedDusktried to warn the Tamaraneans, but Queen Komand'r was too short-sighted and xenophobic to listen. Starfire believed Dusk and tried to warn her fellow Tamaraneans. Komand'r labeled her sister a traitor and banished her. Starfire left the planet and was unable to prevent its destruction. New Tamaran was engulfed by the Sun Eater – along with many of the remaining Tamaraneans and Koriand'r's new husband, Ph'yzzon.[2]\nMany Tamaraneans were off-world during the explosion of New Tamaran, and sought a new home.Ryand'r, Starfire's younger brother, was influential in finding a new home for his lost Tamaranean people. To this end, he helped lead an invasion on the planetKarna, home of theGordanians. Ryand'r eventually enlisted the aid of his sister, Starfire. Starfire duped the Titans into believing that the Gordanians were the invaders, knowing they would not understand or agree had they known all the facts. As the battle progressed, the Titans discovered that the Gordanians weren't the invaders, the Tamaraneans were.\nThe Titans were able to settle the conflict peacefully whenTempestproposed a treaty. The Gordanians would allow them to stay; in exchange, the Tamaraneans would teach them new trades outside of slavery, and bolster their reputation in the galaxy. Both races agreed to these terms. Koriand'r apologized to her friends for her deception, but elected to remain on Karna and rebuild the culture of her people as princess.\nShortly afterward, tragedy struck. During the \"Our Worlds At War\" crisis, a series ofImperiex probesdestroyed Karna. This marks the third Tamaranean home planet that was destroyed. The Tamaraneans continue to wander the galaxy, led by their former Queen Komand'r, also known as Blackfire."

He is the father ofRaven, whom he hopes to use as a portal to the Earthly plane.\nTrigon came into being hundreds upon hundreds of years ago when a group of humans abandoned life on Earth and established a sect of pacifists in the interdimensional world ofAzarath. Embracing the concept of peace, these humans exorcised the dark passions of their souls from their bodies and cast it beyond the Great Door of Azarath into the nether-realms. This leftover evil energy floated in space for years before finally coalescing into a single physical form. The last inhabitants of an alien world summoned this darkness from the ether and it impregnated a woman from the order. Nine months later Trigon was born.[1]\nAs an infant, Trigon slaughtered the very cult responsible for his birth including his own mother. In less than a year, he had conquered the entire planet. By the time he was six-years-old, he destroyed his home world and began traveling across the cosmos in search of new planets to conquer. By the time he was thirty, Trigon had conquered his entire dimension and several million worlds.[2]\nOver the span of centuries, Trigon sired many children — all of whom he hoped would become extensions of his own great power. In many cases, the children of Trigon rebelled against him and were destroyed. Other times, their human mothers recognized the threat such spawn represented and killed them while they were infants. For all of the seeds he had spread across the dimensions, none of his offspring survived to become the heir of Trigon.\nOver two decades ago on Earth, a woman namedAngela Rothhad fallen in with an occult circle. Though they were rank amateurs in the field of Satanic ritual, they nevertheless attempted to summon the Devil. What they succeeded in conjuring was far worse. Trigon emerged — in the form of a being of angelic beauty — and took Angela Roth as his bride. He left her pregnant with child, then abandoned her, destroying the occult circle in the process, patiently awaiting the day when he could call his offspring to his side. Trigon manipulated the priests of Azarath to journey to Earth in search of Angela Roth. He knew that the mother of his soon-to-be child would be safe under the care of these pacifists. They found Angela and brought her to Azarath where she was renamed Arella.\nNot everyone in Azarath was pleased to know that the wife of Trigon was among them. ButAzarand High Magistrate Coman realized that should the child of Trigon be allowed to grow on Earth, her existence would threaten all life on that planet, and indeed, the entire universe as well. Shortly thereafter, Arella gave birth to a daughter who was provided an Azarathian name —Raven.\nThe Magistrate of Food Production, Juris, felt that Raven's existence threatened the sanctity on all life on Azarath. To safeguard his people, he elected to break Azarath's most sacred law — the taking of a human life. Snatching Raven from her nursemaid, he attempted to hurl the child through the Great Door into the Limbo realm separating Azarath from other dimensions. Upon opening the door however, he exposed himself to the power of Trigon who disintegrated him with a blast of energy. Raven, however, was unharmed.[1]\nOver the next several years, Raven felt her father's evil influence slowly growing inside of her. When she was eighteen-years-old, she entered the Temple of Azarath, opened the Great Door and encountered her father for the very first time. This meeting prompted Raven to manifest her soul self for the very first time — that part of herself that was of her father. Realizing the danger that Trigon truly represented, Raven fled Azarath and came to Earth where she sought help in what would one day become a great battle. She first tried to enlist the aid of theJustice League of America, butZatannasensed a great evil in Raven, so they refused. Instead, she used her empathic powers to forceRobin,Changeling,Cyborg,Kid Flash,StarfireandWonder Girlto form theNew Teen Titans.\nTrigon, meanwhile, continued his efforts to conqueror new territories, but found resistance in the form of three powerful mystics. These mystics pooled their power to bar Trigon's path, thus keeping him contained within the netherworld. Though Trigon could not travel to new dimensions, he could still monitor activity on other worlds. He discovered the Earth scientist Simon Jones during an experiment in which Jones succeeded in inventing a machine that could peer into other dimensions. Trigon's power reached through the dimensional aperture and transformed Jones into the super-villain known asPsimon. He ordered him to destroy the mystic priests that barred his ability to come to Earth. To this end, Psimon formed theFearsome Five, but he failed to destroy the mystics due in large part to the efforts of the Justice League of America and the New Teen Titans.[2]\nRealizing that Psimon had failed him, Trigon then sent his advance warrior Goronn to Earth to destroy the Titans. The Titans defeated Goronn, but by this point Trigon had amassed enough raw power to finally enter the Earth dimension on his own. He revealed his displeasure with his agents by dissipating Psimon's body into the ether, and destroying Goronn altogether. Trigon then began his conquest by attacking the city ofManhattan. The Titans engaged him directly in battle, but were no match for his power. During the fight, Raven teleported back to Azarath where her power would be its strongest, but in doing so, she inadvertently showed Trigon the path to the realm of her birth. Trigon appeared in the Temple of Azarath and Raven struck a bargain with him. If he agreed to leave Earth and Azarath be, Raven would return with him to his home dimension and willingly serve him. Trigon accepted her proposal and took her to his nether-realm.[3]\nRaven discovered that Trigon's empire consisted of worlds populated by people who lived in perpetual terror of Trigon's wrath. She tried to help these downtrodden souls, but Trigon quickly showed her the futility of such efforts. Trigon demonstrated his ruthlessness, by eradicating the world of Xynthia. After which, he voiced his plans on taking the Earth. Raven realized that her demonic father never intended on honoring the pact he made, and Raven rebelled against him. The New Teen Titans arrived on this world assisted by Raven's mother Arella. Trigon captured the Titans, but Raven managed to elude his grasp and she soon managed to set them free. Arella used her empathic powers to weaken Trigon's will which allowed the Titans the opportunity to take him down. Wonder Girl supplemented Arella's efforts by using her magic lasso to weaken Trigon even further, while Kid Flash spun his body so fast that he succeeded in opening a doorway to another dimension altogether. Starfire channeled her starbolt energy through Cyborg's amplifier and they succeeded in blasting Trigon through the portal. Arella remained behind to guard the portal and ensure that Trigon could never return to Earth. This plan, however, was doomed to failure.[4]\nAfter biding his time for years, Trigon's power grew in strength and he broke through the portal. Accompanied by hordes of winged demons, he laid siege to Azarath. Trigon's forces razed the Temple of Azarath and slaughtered all of the priests. The souls of those who died housed themselves within the Rings of Azar, worn by Raven herself. The Teen Titans, now accompanied by their former teammateLilith Clay, journeyed to Azarath in the hopes of saving the soul of Raven. Trigon reunited with Raven and completely corrupted her. After destroying Azarath, father and daughter continued their campaign of destruction on Earth.\nTrigon choseTitans Tower Ias his personal throne and transformed it into a T-shaped slab of rough-hewn rock. Trigon issued a decree to the entire world demanding complete and total subservience. From there, he began to remake the world in his own image. The island of New York was terra-formed into a nightmarish landscape of decaying bone and rock. The bodies of four-million inhabitants were fused together as part of an ever-growing spire of writhing, tormented souls. The subjugation of Earth was but a stepping stone in a much more ambitious plan to recreate his home reality. Once Earth was completely under his domination, he intended on physically displacing it into his native Neververse. As Trigon's circle of influence spread outward, Trigon himself entered a state of meditation to recoup his expended power. When he awakened, he discovered that Raven had been defeated by the Titans, Lilith and her mother Arella. By this point, Lilith had taken possession of theRings of Azarand in so doing became a conduit for Azar's spirit. She placed the rings back on Raven's fingers and the souls of Azarath purged the evil from Raven's form. These disembodied spirits, acting on a plot preordained centuries earlier, coalesced into an energy form of pure white light and attacked Trigon. They insinuated themselves into Trigon's being, in effect corrupting his own soul. The conflicting mystical energy proved too much for Trigon and his body discorporated. With Trigon seemingly destroyed, all of his geological manipulations reversed themselves and the world returned to normal.[5]\nTrigon was not truly dead however. He returned to his native realm and once again attempted to reestablish a power base. While expanding his empire, he discovered that he had developed new adversaries from within his own ranks. These were actually the survivingSons of Trigonwho had become the embodiment of the fabledDeadly Sins of Man. As Trigon's offspring gained power, Trigon grew weak. The Sons of Trigon came to Earth where they began conducting strategic attacks against the only group of humans to ever defeat their father, the Titans.[6]To this end, Trigon's offspring kidnapped and used their half-sister Raven as a portal to Trigon's realm, where they betrayed their father by siphoning whatever small power was left within him. Instead of being angered by their treachery, Trigon was actually proud of his evil children.[7]Ultimately, the Sons of Trigon failed to kill the Titans and were defeated by Raven and her team.[8]\n\n\n\nThis character has been primarily an enemy of theTeen Titans, theTitans, or any of the other variousTitans incarnations.

It was published on November 12, 1981.\nAfter relaxing in their pool at Titans Tower, the Teen Titans discuss Starfire's most recent boyfriend, Franklin Crandall. Dick pretends that he's okay with her seeing somebody else, but it is fairly obvious that he is still quite attached to theTamaraneanafter gently rebuffing her advances. Starfire had met Franklin while modeling for Donna under her civilian name Kory Anders. Donna, ever protective of Kory, warned her about revealing her true nature to her new boyfriend.\nBefore long however, Franklin discovered the truth about Kory's alien heritage on his own, but it didn't change how he felt about her. The two continued dating for several weeks and Kory fell completely in love with him.\nNow she is ready to introduce her boyfriend to the rest of the Titans. Donna is still uncomfortable with how quickly Kory has fallen in love with this man, and her discomfort intensifies when Kory tells her that Franklin knows the truth about her.\nIn his home in Greenwich,Connecticut, Franklin Crandall meets with his employer – a rogue agent of theH.I.V.E.This agent wants to get back into the H.I.V.E.'s good graces and believes that he can prove himself by manipulating Crandall into killing one (or more) of the Titans. Crandall is reluctant to aid the H.I.V.E. agent as he has now developed genuine feelings for Starfire. The agent warns him against betrayal.\nMeanwhile, Wally West walks Raven to school for her first day of classes at Manhattan College. She enrolls in a philosophy course and embarrasses herself in class by voicing her opinion at considerable length. One of the students takes an interest in Raven and tells her that he knows of the Cult of Azar and has even practiced some of their disciplines. After class, a couple of boys begin antagonizing Raven and her new friend defends her by punching one of the thugs in the jaw. Raven is as upset with her classmate as she is with her antagonists and tells him that physical violence has never been part of the teachings of Azar.\nThat evening, the Titans go to Harlem to rescue a kidnapped model named Angela Dove from the clutches of mobster Phil Cerullo. Cerullo has kidnapped Angela in order to muscle her boyfriend Jason Silver into not testifying against him at his trial. The Titans burst through the wall of the building and take out Cerullo's gunmen. Starfire stuns the gangster with a starbolt and the other Titans worry about their teammate's apparent power levels.\nBack in Connecticut, Franklin Crandall decides that he cannot betray Starfire. He turns his gun over to the H.I.V.E. agent and tells him that he quits. As Crandall walks away, the H.I.V.E. agent shoots him in the back, killing him. The Titans arrive, unaware that anything is amiss until they find Crandall's body. Robin tries to resuscitate him, but he is too late. Starfire goes berserk and begins firing lethal bolts of energy at the H.I.V.E. agent. Wonder Girl bars her path and warns her that the Titans never kill. The two argue with one another, and the enraged Starfire flies off. Amidst the confusion, the H.I.V.E. agent escapes.\nA short while later, the agent reports back to the H.I.V.E. citadel. The robed members of the inner circle admonish him for operating on his own without the support of the H.I.V.E. They pass judgment against him and summarily execute him. The agent's body is found the following day in New York with six bullet holes in his chest.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\n\nAcross the United States, strange occurrences take place involving otherwise normal human beings acting like animals. Clark Kent broadcasts a report on the phenomena, after which, he changes clothes to investigate the matter more deeply as Superman. He sees a strange beam of energy, visible only to his enhanced Kryptonian senses, strike a man, seemingly devolving him so that he begins scampering about the streets like an ape. He swoops down and pulls the man safely out of busy traffic, then flies off into the outer atmosphere to trace the origin of the energy beam. He surmises that the energy beam originated somewhere near the planet Pluto. What Superman finds though is a barrier of energy encircling the Earth. The closer he comes to it, the weaker he grows. He sees a meteor from outer space pierce the barrier and begin falling towards Earth. He catches the object and propels it back towards the barrier.\nAs he makes contact with the energy barrier, a loud \"Pop\" occurs and Superman finds himself dizzy and temporarily blinded. Blinking away the spots before his eyes, he begins falling back towards Earth. He soon realizes however that contact with the energy barrier somehow transported him to a parallel reality. He flies towards what he believes is the Daily Planet building, but quickly discovers that it is actually the office of a talking rabbit named Roger. Before Roger sees him, Superman changes into his civilian attire. Roger is at first frightened by the big \"pink\" man, but Clark manages to calm him down. He learns that this entire world is populated with sentient anthropomorphic beings, similar to animals found on Earth. While attempting to explain his situation, Roger goes to his window box and takes a carrot. He doesn't realize that the carrot is glowing with a mysterious energy. Superman scans the vegetable with his x-ray vision and sees that it has been affected by radiation from the shattered meteor particles. He snatches the carrot from Roger's hand and throws it away before he can eat any more. It is too late however. The glowing carrot alters Roger's physical body, giving him enhanced senses and super-strength. Donning a costume he had laying about from a previous costume party, he begins calling himself Captain Carrot.\nSuperman and Captain Carrot discover that violent riots are taking place at the nearby United Nature Building in Gnu York. The U.N. delegates have de-evolved and are behaving instinctively like their animal namesakes. Roger creates a super-thump with his giant foot, and succeeds in at least temporarily calming everybody down. Superman deduces that the meteor that he pushed through the energy barrier, shattered upon entering this parallel world, and that fragments of it have enhanced several other animal people across the country. His primary concern however is the devolution ray that has affected the members of the U.N. This ray is also responsible for devolving the people from Superman's home dimension. Superman flies off to investigate the origin of this mysterious ray beam, citing that the fate of two worlds hangs in the balance. Roger Rabbit takes a super-bunny leap behind him and shouts \"You're not going anywhere without – Captain Carrot!\"\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\n\n"

It was published on May 13, 2015.\nAt theWatchtower, theJustice Leagueis in communication withMartian Manhunterand theJustice League United, who are monitoring a disturbance at the edge of the universe. WhenSupermanand reinforcements arrive, they discover that the disturbance appears to be aplanettrying to encroach on their reality. The event has attracted the attention of even theRed Lanternsand other galactic protectors. Superman worries that they can't merelypushit back into its own reality, because the planet may be populated with people who needhelp. Elsewhere, even theGuardians of the Universeknow that the people on that planet need help, but that it cannot be them who gives it. Worriedly, Superman determines that the best they can do right now is wait and see what happens. Meanwhile,Nix UotanandDarkseidwatch the phenomenon with considerable interest.\nMeanwhile, on the planetTelos, the sorcererDeimoshas siphoned the power of theTime Masters, and now uses his magic to usurp control of the planet from its masters. He offers the people once imprisoned on the planet's surface a choice toservehim and live on the planet together, or bedestroyed. He gives only one hour to decide. As he looks over the people of the planet, he wonders what it means that there are so many iterations of thesamepeople out there. At his side,Yolanda Montezwonders whether it is his intent torulethem. He sneers that hecannotrule them. They are uncontrollable. After referring to her as \"Wildcat\", she questions him on it, and he responds that it is hertruename - who she was and who she will be. He explains that histrueintent is to lead the people on the planet to theirdeaths, and use those deaths to fuel a magic that will create a universe that will belong tohim.\nOn the planet's surface,The FlashcarriesDick Grayson, running from city to city. On the way, Dick wonders what happened toTelos. He had disappeared whenShamballahfell, and the earthquakes began. The pair come across aman down, and wonder what side he's on. Worriedly, Dick wonders if anyone evenhasa side to be on, besides their own. Jay decides thattheyshould side with whichever side does notkill, and opts to help theTitansagainst theExtremists. The Extremists are powerful, though, and Jay considers retreat untilValpoints out that they have help coming inanotherSupermanandanotherFlash. In that moment, the Extremists balk at facingtwoSupermen, and retreat to seek out Deimos. In the meantime, after meeting their counterparts from other worlds, the heroes decide that they should join with each other to save their worlds.\nStill, they wonder how they can fight alivingplanet. Dick responds that Telos has disappeared. He is not the threat they face. It was Deimos who changed the game. It is no longer city versus city, but those who will worship versus those who will not. Taking charge, the Superman native to this city urges everyone to seek out all those who will help, leaving him alone with Dick. Superman takes him aside to explain that his unique perspective may be ahelp. He hasheardevery conversation Dick had with Telos, and he believes that they will have to ally with Telos if they hope to defeat Deimos. Dick is the key to that alliance.\nJay, meanwhile, encounters aSuperboyfrom another world, who seems somewhat impetuous, and Jay supposes that maybe now's not the best time to convince him, as thesky has turned blood red. Unexpectedly, Jay rushes head-first into yetanotherFlash, this one calledBarry Allen.\nDick searches for Telos, calling him out. Telos responds, explaining that withBrainiacgone, he has no answers as to where his family and people were sent. He is forever separated from them, and yet barely feels the loss, thanks to the reprogramming that was done to him. Dick senses that Telos is aware that he has a rare opportunity here to correct themistakesthat were made in the service of Brainiac. They can use his control over the planet to help fight Deimos, and hopefully learn his true name from the sorcerer in the process. Telos agrees that this plan is acceptable, hoping to saveeveryonewho was cast aside and forgotten, so that they can fight for the future of all.\nHaving assembled a group of sympathetic heroes from all the other cities on the planet, Superman and company surround Deimos in the open and offer him a chance to surrender. Grinning, he responds that he's noneedto surrender. Despite being outnumbered, a great many people have already agreed to follow him, thinking their lives depend on it. He summons a group of heroes and villains from other cities; desperate, cynical, and evil individuals. He leads them in a charge, promising that if they kill all who oppose him, this world will betheirs.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nConcepts:\n\n"

Donna invitesStarfireto live with her as her roommate. Starfire tells her new friends about her youth and how she was sold into slavery in order to stalemate a centuries-long war between the people of herhome-worldand the conquering forces of theCitadel. Raven suddenly appears before him and warns them of a new mission.Robindoesn't like the idea of snapping to attention every time Raven summons them, but his vocal protest earns himself the ire of teammateKid Flashwho has recently become extremely defensive when it comes toRaven.

He is a member of theJustice League of America.\nThe construction of Cyborg.\nVictor Stone is the son of a pair of scientists,SilasandElinore Stone, who decided to use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects. However, Victor grew to resent this treatment and fell in with a young miscreant namedRon Everswho led him into trouble with the law. This was the beginning of a struggle where Victor strove for his own life engaging in pursuits his parents disapproved of such as athletics. In addition, Victor still kept bad company that led him into incidents such as when he was talked into participating in a street gang fight in which he was wounded. For the most part however, Victor still had a largely normal life under the circumstances where he also refused to follow his best friend's grandiose plans of racially motivated terrorism.[2]\nAll that changed one day when he visited his parents at work atS.T.A.R. Labs. Coincidentally, an experiment in dimensional travel went horribly awry when a massive gelatinous monster crossed over an experimental portal and killed Victor's mother. The creature then turned on Victor and severely mutilated him before his father managed to force the creature back through the portal. To save his son, who was unconscious at this time, Victor's father outfitted him with experimental prostheses of his own design. However, the equipment could not be worn inconspicuously, and thus Victor was horrified upon regaining consciousness to see much of his body, including part of his face, replaced with sheer metallic limbs and implants. Although Victor wanted to die at this shock, he adjusted enough through his resulting physical therapy to control his implants with suitable skill.[2]\nUpon release from medical care, he found his life was seriously inconvenienced with the fearful reactions of the public at his implants; even hisgirlfriendrejected him. In addition, he was also disallowed his participation in athletics not only for his implants but for his poor grades which were further exacerbated by his long convalescence. However, when his old friend attempted to use Victor's troubles to manipulate him into attempting a terrorist attack on theUnited Nations, Victor found a new purpose as he equipped his weapons attachments and stopped his friend in a pitched battle on the UN building.[2]\nHe joined theTeen Titans, initially for the benefit of a support group of kindred spirits and freaks and has remained with that group ever since. In addition, Victor found new friends who saw past his disfigurements to his own nobility such as a group of children who were adjusting to their own prostheses and idolized Victor with his fancy parts and exciting adventures as well as their beautiful teacherSarah Simms, who took a shine to him herself.[3]\nThroughout his association with the Titans, Victor has been destroyed, reconstructed, assimilated by an alien race, and had his humanity restored.\nThis section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information, expanding on the subject matter in order to bring this article to a higher standard of quality.\nMain article:New Titans: Titans Hunt\nWhen the TitanJerichowas driven mad by the souls ofAzarath,[4]he seized control of theWildebeest Societyand began kidnapping Titans. Victor was captured and launched into space, where his rocket exploded and he crash landed inRussia, where he was discovered by his fellow TitanRed Star, and restored by Russian scientists to the best of their ability. While his body was repaired, his mind and memories were gone, leaving him an empty shell only responding to direct orders.[5]\nLeonid and Dr.Sarah Charlescontinued trying to restore Vic's memories, when suddenly, his body sprang alive without being given orders. He fled in a rampage to a cabin in theCatskill Mountains, which contained a failsafe designed by his late father to return his memories. Victor regains control of his body as Leonid and Sarah enter with soldiers, triggering a self-destruct protocol, erasing his memories yet again.[6]\nCyberion reveals himself.\nIn a desperate plea to save his friend,Changelingstruck a deal with theBrotherhood of Evilto steal theMento Helmet. This ended in his kidnapping as the Brotherhood was working withTechnis, a robotic life form which came to Earth during its universal search for knowledge and cataloging.[7]\nIn another attempt to revive Victor,Prestor Jon, a Titan from thefuturewho existed within cyberspace, entered Vic's internal computer only to find him still alive, begging to be freed.[8]Technis interfaced with Victor, explaining that it was not one single being but was a mass of hundreds of them; beings who had a linked minded aptitude to collecting. They had searched for him in order to gain his human soul.[9]Being functionally dead in his own body, he accepted the offer, merging with Technis to become a fully robotic being. He later asked Changeling to help him on his journey with Technis in the pursuit of cataloging the universe.[10]Garfield accepted and Cyborg, now called Cyberion Technis, travelled around the universe until the day Technis was destroyed in a battle. This utterly changed Cyberion as he now lost his second family which shook loose his humanity again and he began to remember his old self and longed for its return.\nMain article:JLA/Titans: The Technis Imperative\nVictor wanted to honor the Technis imperative and continue to explore the universe, but the farther they traveled, the more Victor's humanity faded away. Losing faith in his best friend, Beast Boy abandoned Vic and returned to Earth. Now entirely alone, Victor fully gave into his cybernetic body and began collecting and assimilating everything in his way until he became as big as the moon, eventually returning to Earth and overtaking the moon, and with it theJLA Watchtower. TheJLAwas angered at this hostile takeover and attacked, not knowing that this machine was Cyborg. While in Earth's vicinity, Cyborg sent probes to kidnap anyone that was on the Titans roster, includingGreen LanternandThe Atom, confining them in virtual reality pods inTitans Island. Victor's actions resulted in horrible natural disasters and plant-wide technological threats and shut downs.[11]\nEvents coalesced in the Justice League,Young Justice, JLA Reserves,Titans, and Teen Titans all being assembled to determine the best course of action for handling the threat. Yet when a consensus could not be reached, a massive fight broke out over the destruction of Cyborg. This fight distracted Cyborg's programming and allowed a team of Leaguers and Titans to break off and head towards the moon where the main central power core of Cyborg's being was held. The Titans succeeded in bringing the human out of Cyborg by manipulating his virtual reality environmental programming and using it on Cyborg himself; producing an image of Victor's father. With Victor's soul being set free from Technis' programming,Raventried to use her powers to upload it into the Titan's mainframe computer, but it was not compatible. Instead, Raven placed Victor's soul inside of theOmegadromewhere it became a golden, shape-shifting body.[12]\nVic's new body.\nIn order to keep an eye on Vic,Nightwingkept him on the Titans, until he was ready to present him with a surprise: a new human body. Vic learned that when he crash landed in Russia duringTitans Hunt, the scientists that rebuilt him kept his DNA on file, and used it to grow a clone body, which appeared human but retained some cybernetics. Vic's consciousness was downloaded into the clone body, and he subsequently left the Titans, moving toLos Angelesto be closer to Gar and Dr. Charles.[13]\nCyborg returns to the fray.\nAfter spending some time in California, Vic was called intoKeystone CitybyThe Flashto help build a machine which could send attackingParademonsback toApokolipsthrough aBoom Tube. Using his shape-shifting cybernetic body, Victor dons his Cyborg armor once again in order to face the alien threat. During the battle, theBlack Racer, an embodiment of death, attempts to claim the life of a little girl, but Flash and Cyborg send him through the machine, globally crippling the Parademon armies. After the battle, Vic says he didn't belong in California, and asks ifCentral Cityis in need of a superhero.[14]\nThis section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information, expanding on the subject matter in order to bring this article to a higher standard of quality.\nHe later went on to mentor a new Teen Titans group, consisting mainly of sidekicks, most of whom have taken over the secret identities of former members (i.e. Tim Drake, the third Robin, instead of Dick Grayson, the original Robin and Titans leader), as well as stalwarts such asStarfire,Raven, andBeast Boy, where they have fought enemies such asDeathstroke,Doctor Light, and theTitans of Tomorrow.\nThis section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information, expanding on the subject matter in order to bring this article to a higher standard of quality.\nDuringInfinite Crisis, Cyborg joined Donna's New Cronus Team that went to investigate a hole in the universe that was discovered during theRann-Thanagar War. He left Beast Boy in charge of the Titans while he was gone. They arrived at the re-set center of the universe and with the help of assorted heroes, aided in the defeat ofAlexander Luthor, who was attempting to re-create theMultiverseand build a perfect Earth from it.\nCyborg was fused together withFirestormafter returning to Earth. This was caused by the energy ripples caused by Alexander Luthor Jr. which altered the Zeta Ray Beams the heroes were going to use to return home.[15]\nAfter being severely damaged during the events ofInfinite Crisis, Cyborg was rebuilt over time in thanks to Tower caretakersWendyandMarvin. He awoke one year later to find a wholly different group of Titans led byRobin, the only member from the team he formed prior to going into space. Cyborg felt that members such asKid DevilandRavagerwere hardly worthy of being Titans, and thus was attempting to find a way to re-form \"the real Titans\".\nAfter the team along with theDoom Patroldefeated theBrotherhood of Evil, Cyborg asked Beast Boy to rejoin the Titans, but Gar refused saying that his skills were needed with the Patrol. After returning toTitans Tower, Cyborg began reviewing the security tapes during the last year, in which it appears that he was looked to by all the Titans of the past year for a shoulder to lean on, despite being in a coma-like state.\nAlthough Cyborg did retain the position of statesman amongst the Teen Titans and occasionally played second-in-command to Robin's lead, he no longer operated as a Titan in any official capacity.\nShortly thereafter,Batman,Wonder WomanandSupermanagreed that Cyborg should be offered membership in the newJustice League. However, following a battle againstAmazo,Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)andBlack Canarytook over the formation of the JLA, and Cyborg was not included among the roster.[16]\nCyborg began putting together a new branch ofTitans Eastwhich consisted ofAnima,Dove,Hawk,Lagoon Boy,Little BardaandPower Boy. During a training exercise, the team was attacked by an unknownfoeand Cyborg was severely injured.[17]This incident inspires the original members of the \"New\" Teen Titans to regroup and investigate the situation.[18]\nCyborg's new team didn't work out and when the new Teen Titans formed after his Titan's East's destruction he played second in command again. Although not officially on the roster he helped them on their investigations; he later joined officially and headed the new team ofTeen Titans. They had many adventures together when their numbers started to grow and the founding members started to move on to bigger things.Wonder Girlbegan to lead this new team and they moved toTitans TowerinSan Francisco,California. Soon the old founding members joined an unofficial team called theTitansto work as a family and a place to relax from their all overwhelming lives. But the peace didn't last when lives started to overlap and intersect and fewer members started showing up.\nWhen the Titans fell apart again, Cyborg joined the JLA alongside Dick (as Batman) and Donna Troy. Officially on the team, he did not enter the field of battle much. Instead, he devoted his time to helping improve the Red Tornado's android body.\n\n\n\n\nThis character is or was primarily a member of the younger superhero team known as theTeen Titans, in any of itsvarious incarnations.

Since his inception, Telos has worked for every version of Brainiac that has ever existed in every incarnation of theMultiverse, faithfully carrying out the task. His most recent master was theBrainiacof theFutures Endtimeline, who he served until his master mysteriously disappeared while trying to acquire theMetropolisof his native timeline.\nMain article:Convergence (event)\nIn the wake of Brainiac's absence, Telos came to the conclusion that since Brainiac is unique, so it must be unique. Based on this premise, Telos decided to judge that Brainiac intended to have the captive cities of the Multiverse into fighting each other to deem the survivors worthy. To ensure the cities' inhabitants of their cooperation, Telos threatened to have them destroyed. Telos enacted his competition when several denizens fromEarth 2unprecedentedly arrived on his world.[1]\nAfter briefly capturing the Earth 2 natives, Telos was confused by their sudden appearance until he was temporarily weaken by Green LanternAlan Scottand allowing his prisoners to escape. Telos soon recovered and attempted to locate the Earth 2 natives in which he found and rescued theEarth 2 Dick Grayson.[2]He eventually located his wards inSkartaris, where the evil sorcererDeimoshad absorbed the powers of the time travellers that Brainiac had imprisoned.[3]Deimos took the opportunity of summoning Brainiac, who is trapped in aT-Sphere, and peered into his mind to reveal the shocking truth to Telos's identity: he was not a planet created by Brainiac, but rather he was once a man - a man with a family. In the past, his world was threatened by Brainiac and then forced into eternal servitude for him in exchange for the lives of his wife and children. The revelation deeply traumatized Telos and at this moment of weakness allowed Deimos to take control of the Blood Moon.[4]\nDuring the duration of Deimos' takeover, Telos retreated and remained at a complete loss over the life that he once had. He was soon tracked down by Dick Grayson, who convinced him that he is freed from Brainiac's conditioning and that he can make his own decisions to correct the mistakes he had wrought, and the possibility of using his powers to finding his family. Compelled, Telos agreed with Grayson to help stopping Deimos and saving every captive on the planet.[5]Telos joined Grayson's group of heroes from disparate worlds in battling Deimos and fully regaining control of the planet from the sorcerer. However,Parallaxkilled Deimos and unwittingly released the unstable temporal energies the sorcerer acquired from the time travellers and causing the imminent destruction of the Multiverse.[6]\nTelos was not powerful enough to undo the damages, but foresaw who can: Brainiac. The heroWaveridersummoned Telos' master despite vocal oppositions from his former captives. Brainiac, regrettable of his actions, helped in saving the Multiverse by sending a group of heroes to prevent theFirst Crisisand returning the captive cities and its inhabitants back to their realities. With this task finished, Brainiac relinquished Telos' bondage and vanished. Telos transported the Blood Moon to the Earth 2 reality and granted the planet to the Earth 2 survivors as their new home world. Soon afterward he departed for parts unknown in search for his family that he now fully remembers.[7]\n\n"

Through his marriage toLuand'r, he was gifted three children:Komand'r,Koriand'randRyand'r. But the same fate that took his mother would strike again. This time, the Citadel took Koriand'r. She would eventually resurface, much to his joy. But he had other issues. Internal politics demanded a union between the royal houses, and Koriand'r was forced to marryKarrasof the Southern States.[1]The wedding did not last; Karras was killed.[2]Over time, Komand'r returned to her native planet, and having betrayed it to the Citadel, usurped the throne.\nMyand'r's rule had always been at the sacrifice of everything he loved, based on the last words his mother said to him: Tamaran came before all. Feeling his weakness was responsible for Tamaran's continuing state of war, he decided to face destiny. When theGordaniansthreatened to destroy his planet, Myand'r chose not to evacuate. He perished alongside his wife when the planet exploded.[3]\n\n"

He is the successor toTerry Sloane. Despite having no powers, hisT-Spheresmake him invisible to technology and he is a member of theJustice Society.\nAt a young age, Michael Holt showed remarkable intelligence, reading and assimilating the works of Bohr, Einstein, Planck and Feynman, the pantheon of theoretic physics, at the age of six. He studied advanced science, space and time \"while other children struggled throughSesame Street.\"\nHolt displayed as he called it, \"a natural aptitude for having natural aptitudes,\" easily picking up and retaining complex skills and abilities that other men spent their entire lives perfecting. Before he began his career as a superhero, he already possessed 14 Ph.D's (two in Engineering and Physics -- including assorted doctorates and masters in degrees in Law, Psychology, Chemistry, Political Science, Computer Science, Rocket Science, and Mathematics). He was a self-made multi-millionaire with a high tech firm called Cyberwear (later Holt Holdings Inc.) and was a Gold-medal winning Olympic decathlete.\nWhile contemplating suicide after the death of his mentally handicapped older brother and the accidental death of his wife and unborn child, Holt was met by the Spirit of God's Vengeance, known as theSpectre(ironically, Holt is an atheist), who told him aboutTerry Sloane, the \"Golden Age\" superhero known as Mister Terrific[1]. Inspired by Sloane's life story he took the name Mister Terrific and later joined the currentJustice Society of America, eventually serving as its chairman.\nHe initially wore ordinary clothes and a leather jacket with Sloane's \"Fair Play\" emblem on the back. He currently wears a T-shaped mask, a black and white costume with red trim, and a collarless jacket in the same colors (the black sections of tunic and jacket forming a \"T\") with \"Fair Play\" written on the sleeves and \"Terrific\" on the back.\nFor a time he acted as spokesperson for Tylerco and consulted that company on industrial espionage and security matters in exchange for that company helping fund a youth center Terrific had started.\nHolt has a friendly rivalry withBatman, his opposite number in theJustice League of America. Also, Michael Holt has encountered Terry Sloane twice through time travel, with Sloane expressing pride in having so worthy a successor. Holt has been noted as the most intelligent member of the JSA in its history, surpassing his predecessor. He describes himself as the third smartest person in the world.\nDuring a conflict over leadership of the Justice Society between former chairmanHawkmanand then-current chairmanSand, Terrific was elected as the JSA's new chairman by his teammates, despite not actively seeking the office. He served in this capacity until the team disbanded following theInfinite Crisis.\nMister Terrific was part of the team assembled by Batman for an attack on theBrother Eyesatellite responsible for controlling theOMACs. He played a critical role as his invisibility to technology allowed him to reach the satellite's propulsion system, sending it crashing to Earth. On this meeting he met and befriended another African American superhero -Black Lightning.\nAs part ofOne Year Later, though Holt is still a member of the JSA, he has also become part of the United Nations Security Council's intelligence agencyCheckmate. He initially held the position of White King's Bishop, but when the previous White King (Alan Scott) was forced to resign, he became Checkmate's new White King, complicating his relationship withSasha Bordeaux, Checkmate's Black Queen. He has also given up his chairman position, which has been taken over byPower Girl. Mister Terrific has also established an ill-defined mentorship with the latestFirestorm,Jason Rusch, over the missing year. The specifics of their meeting are yet to be documented.\nAfterSuperman, Batman, andWonder Womanbegan discussing the reformation of the Justice League, in regards to Mister Terrific as a potential member, Batman said, \"I think we can get him.\" Wonder Woman reminded Batman of Terrific's position of leadership in the JSA, but Batman insisted, \"That doesn't matter, we can get him.\"\nShortly after, Mister Terrific went to theGotham General Hospitalalong with Doctor Mid-Nite to take care ofSelina Kyle, whose heart was removed from her body byHush.[2]After Batman recovered her heart, he informed Holt about the technology used to keep the heart living outside the body and after retrieving the heart, Holt and Mid-Nite performed a surgery on Selina to place her heart back. The surgery was a success, but they were not sure if Selina would ever be Catwoman again.[3]\n\n\n\n\nJustice Society of AmericamemberThis character has been a primary member of theJustice Society of Americain any of its various incarnations.

Worshiped as a goddess by her followers, the Lady sends forth her legions to ravage planets and transform their populations into her undead slaves. This is known as the \"Stygian Passover.\" In her twisted mind, this is a way of bringing order to a chaotic universe, uniting all peoples as one race with a single purpose, worshiping her.\nLady Styx's missionaries are known as \"Darkstars,\" taken from the former intergalactic peacekeeping force of thesame name. Transformed into zombies and robbed off their individual identities, these brainwashed beings preach her glory, and urge their enemies to \"believe in her.\"\nLady Styx put a bounty on the heads ofStarfire,Adam StrangeandAnimal Man, who'd been stranded in space after theInfinite Crisis. Seeing the destruction wrought by her followers and fearing their home worlds could be next, the trio of space heroes decide to make a stand against her. They were able to gain the help of a somewhat reluctantLobo, who had recently found religion himself. Lobo led them to Lady Styx on the pretense of collecting on their bounty, before launching a full-out assault on her throne room. The resulting battle would also lead to the apparent death of Animal Man via anecrotoxin(although he was later resurrected by the very aliens who originally gave him his powers). Lady Styx was later apparently killed, absorbed by aSun-Eaterwhile battling theGreen LanternEkron(a.k.a. the \"Emerald Head\").[1]Some time later though, she was able to grow new flesh for herself from a pregnant captive.\nAfter 52, Lady Styx has re-appeared in several places. In the pages of \"Mystery in Space,\" she is the source ofCaptain Comet's death and rebirth, a cycle which began when her forces attacked him in their first appearance. She would also fight theOmega Men, when she sought out powerful artifacts known as the \"heartstones\" in her attempt to remake the universe and usurp the role of God. Apparently trapped in another dimension, Lady Styx manifests here as a giantess.\nOnce again, she tries growing new flesh from the bodies of her followers. Using the stones as a focus, she recreates a new, giant body, combining and reshaping her supplicants' bodies. She is stopped in her plan by the Omega Men and finally killed by a resurrected and empowered \"Felicity\" (wife of the Omega Men's commander-in-chiefTigorr), now re-christened \"Nimbus\". However, Lady Styx was apparently able to hold her consciousness together within Felicity's subconscious. There, the Lady waited to strike again.\nIn \"Countdown to Adventure,\" Styx was able to infect bothEarthandRannwith her Stygian Virus creating a band of radicalistic followers. On Earth, there were many random outbursts of people acting homicidal and psychopathic, and on Rann the public united under a new hero with her guidance, an Earthman namedChamp Hazard, who was much more destructive and violent than Adam Strange.\nMore recently, although the direct influence of Lady Styx was purged from the Rannians, they have continued to worship her as a deity, although not quite as devoutly. Her influence on Rannian culture plays a big role in the event \"Rann-Thanagar: Holy War.\"\n\n\nThis is anin-universearticle without-of-universematerial."

It was published on April 8, 2015.\nIn the city ofEl Inferno,HawkmanandHawkwomanof analternate timeline and universehave just killed theJustice Ridersmercilessly. They look to Brainiac's drones for guidance in who to destroynext, but get no answer. Uncaring, Hawkwoman simply challenges them to bringfurtherchampions, because warriors ofThanagarwill not surrender if it means they can keep someshadeoftheirworld alive.\nInGotham City,NightwingandOraclehave begun toadaptto their new way of life, under the dome. His impulsive nature is in conflict with her calculations and forethought, but that impulsive nature means he lives in the moment - which is what theybothneeded when they wereforcedto adapt. From her place in theClock Tower, she guides him on a new mission to stopMister Freezeat the museum. Unfortunately, noteveryoneadapted as well as Nightwing did. Even before Dick can gain the upper hand, Freeze abandons his robbery, simplygiving up. The despair of knowing that there is no way to get out of the city - that he will never see any of the people who had lived outside it again - has taken its toll, and he has lost the motivation to continue.\nKind of depressed by the whole ordeal, Dick asks for some time alone, going radio silent for a time. After getting off-air, he meets up withStarfire, whom he confides in. He has something he's been meaning to do, but with the way things have gone, he isn't sure he has arightto do it. He isn't sure he has therightto behappy. Sighing, Kory reminds that he can't afford tofearhappiness. He has this chance, and he shouldtakeit, becauseeveryoneneeds to know that in this new state of affairs,somethingstill matters.\nAfter returning to Barbara, Dick is still a bit preoccupied. He is shaken by something she understands all too well. The reason Freeze surrendered was because he saw thepointlessness. He saw the track of the endless treadmill that they are now on. She can't bear to tell him, but she's beginning to feel the same way. Failing to sense it in her, he asks her to get dressed up, and insists on taking her out to dinner.\nBarbara can't help but be down about the fact that the restaurant menus have beenshrinkingand becoming morebland, of late. With the lack of places toimportfrom, it wasPoison Ivywho saved everyone by growing food inRobinson Park. Part of her feels ashamed for having treated Ivy like a villain for so long.\nOver dinner, Dick interrupts Babs' order to tell her how he feels about her. He explains that whatever happens in this world, he knows they can bear it if they haveeach other. Pulling a ring out of his pocket, he asks her to marry him. After a pause, though, she admits that shecan't. Confused, he asks why, but she has no time to answer him, because the dome around the city suddenlyvanishes. Internally, Barbara can't help but wonder if this is asignthat sheshouldaccept his proposal. Feelingfree, for the first time in a while, the pair of them eat dinneroutside, and enjoy themselves for anhour- but by the end of that hour, theinvaderscame.\nHawkman approaches Barbara and explains that heknows- thanks to all-seeing drone bots called Absorbascons - that she secretly runs Gotham, as they secretly rantheirGotham. While he knows also that there wereotherversions of he and Hawkwoman on Barbara's earth, he assures her that he is not that Hawkman. Hawkwoman explains their intent to kill everyone in the city for the sake of their own, and Barbara is sure shemeansit. Before Hawkwoman can finish her speech, Babs has Nightwing make asurpriseattack. Unfortunately, he is not strong enough to take onthisversion of Hawkman alone.\nEven so, Hawkwoman turns to Barbara and admits that she does notlikerules. Thanagarians fight to win in a manner that allows no future resistance. For that reason, she offers a plan: she and Hawkman intend to abandon their weaker city, and let it be destroyed. If Barbara agrees, they will then be allowed to take refuge inthisGotham. Hawkwoman explains that she and Hawkman are all that remain of their Thanagar. If they die, regardless of which city they champion, it is the end of their Thanagar. Thecatchto the plan, though, is that this city will be ruled by them and remade in Thanagar's image.\nNaturally, Dick outright refuses the offer, challenging her to battle, as was the original plan. She responds that if he goes along that line, he and his peoplewilldie. She gives himone hourto change his mind. He turns to Barbara, eager to prepare for battle, but she has to tell him no asecondtime this night. She hasn't got thewillto fight beings like them. Incredulous, Dick leaves her to pick up weapons from theBatcave, intent on fighting with or without her.\nAs Dick leaves, Barbara gets out her laptop. She had been forced tofeignfatalism because of the enemy's Absorbascons. The truth is that shedoesrun the city, and while they gave her an hour topreparefor battle, she had already started fighting themten minutes ago.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\n\n\n\n"

It was published on July 10, 1980.\nSuperman is relieved from monitor duty aboard the JLA Satellite by Green Lantern. In the middle of his monitor duty he is seemingly contacted by fellow Green Lantern Archon Z'Gmora of the Cygnus system. His fellow Lantern asks for assistance telling him that he is trapped in another dimension and his power ring has run out of power, his only means of communicating with Hal is via his telepathy. With communication broken, Green Lantern recharges his ring and uses it to travel to this other dimension. However, he learns that he has fallen for a trap.\nArchon is already dead and he had been replaced by a creature called N'Gom. The creature seemingly slays Green Lantern, takes his form and removes his power ring. It gloats aloud about how it was a singular entity until one day an energy tendril from a green sun split it into two distinct beings. The two would war with each other and find that they were evenly matched in their present forms. Since then the two have sought out more powerful beings to replicate in order to destroy each other. It had trapped Archon hoping to steal his power ring, but was forced to contact Hal Jordan when it proved to be powerless. Now with Hal's Power Ring and Power Battery in his possession, the N'Gom is confident that it can destroy its doppelganger.\nHowever, Hal is not really dead, at the last moment he had used his Power Ring to separate his soul from his body. Not in an incorporeal form he wonders how he can stop this menace. Getting close enough to his ring to effect it with is will power, Green Lantern pulls Superman from Metropolis before the Man of Steel can save a man who fell from the top of a building under construction. There Superman appears before the N'gom posing as Green Lantern, and the Man of Steel believes it to be his friend. Worried that the creature will slay his ally, Hal re-enters his body and blows the N'Gom's cover. Leading to a clash between the two. Superman manages to fend off the Power Rings energy by wrapping his cape around his arm and using the yellow Superman emblem to deflect the any attacks.\nCompensating for this the N'Gom uses the Power Ring to create a massive chunk of Green Kryptonite that threatens to kill the Man of Steel. Green Lantern then grabs a rock and strikes his enemy in the back of the head with it, breaking his concentration and sending the Kryptonite disappear. Superman resumes his fight with the N'Gom, and beats it senseless, knocking it out causes it to resume its natural form.\nSuperman hands Green Lantern back his Power Ring and he uses it to contain the N'Gom so that he cannot threaten anyone again. When Superman laments over the construction worker falling to his death, Green Lantern points out that time moves much slower in this dimension and they both return to Metropolis with enough time to save the falling man.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\n\nRobin arrives at S.T.A.R. Labs which is currently being besieged by terrorists. He prepares to move in on them, but suddenly finds himself transported into a strange new environment. He finds himself outside a large building called Titans Tower. He sees a few familiar faces such as Wonder Girl and Beast Boy (now calling himself Changeling), but also meets teen heroes he has never seen before, such as Cyborg, Raven and Starfire. Wonder Girl reminds him that these are the \"New\" Teen Titans, and the young heroes cannot understand why Robin doesn't recognize them.\nThere is little time to ponder the matter however as the Titans alert system indicates that an amorphous blob has been seen attacking S.T.A.R. Labs. Robin and the New Teen Titans go to S.T.A.R. Labs and discover that the blob creature is actually an alien from another dimension. One of S.T.A.R.'s scientists, Silas Stone, inadvertently provided the alien access to this dimension. He warns the heroes that unless the creature is stopped, it will convert all of the world's oxygen into methane, rendering the planet lifeless.\nThe Titans work together and upon Robin's suggestion, begin pumping oxygen out of the building, depriving the alien the ability to convert it to harmful methane. They drive the creature back through the dimensional aperture.\nAs the adventure concludes, Robin finds himself transported back to his original environment. He is outside S.T.A.R. Labs with an NYPD officer. The officer tells him that he had heard him mutter something about pumping the oxygen out of the building, so they took his suggestion and forced the terrorists to evacuate. Robin is pleased that the situation is resolved, but is still stunned by the strange people and images that he had apparently dreamed about.\nFrom around the corner, Raven watches the confused hero walk away. What Robin experienced was not a dream, but a vision of the future - a vision provided for him by Raven.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nSargon the Sorcerer, in retirement, is visiting the museum where his ruby is kept.

Donna tells her that it was a gift from Queen Hippolyta. What none of the Titans present realize is that someone is surreptitiously taking surveillance photos of Donna's studio.\nGar and Tara walk Dick back to his midtown apartment. Again, someone continues to take photographs of the group, but none of them seem to be aware of it. After dropping Dick off, Gar and Tara walk over to a nearby frozen pond where Vic Stone and Sarah Simms are ice skating with a group of Sarah's disabled wards. Vic loses his balance and falls onto the ice, and Sarah and the children begin laughing at them. Vic is only slightly embarrassed, but his humiliation is compounded when Gar turns into a bunny and begins poking fun at him. Afterwards,Vicreturns home where he finds a letter from his grandparents. The letter indicates that they will be visiting him some time soon. Vic is not overjoyed to receive such news. As before, someone takes a snapshot of him from outside his apartment.\nLater, Gar walks Tara down to the East River. She finally relents to his persistent affections and the two share a kiss. Gar leaves, and Tara takes the raft to Titans Tower. She stops by Raven's room and finds the empath in the midst of meditation. Raven doesn't trust Tara, but as she has been dealing with so many emotional issues as of late, she cannot determine whether her apprehension is justified, or if it is just a by-product of her father Trigon's influence over her.\nSome time later, theTitansregroup at the tower and Cyborg goes through a training exercise. He succeeds in overcoming a five-ton steel press. Donna and Kory spar with one another atop a floating raft in the Titans' swimming pool. Donna has never defeated Kory during these trials and is determined to win. Kory reminds her once again that she was trained by the Warlords of Okaara, and that fighting is second-nature to her. She proves her point by kicking Donna in the jaw, knocking her into the pool. Terra silently watches the various trials, taking note of her potential teammates strengths and weaknesses.\nThe next training exercise takes place outside. The Titans want to see what Tara is truly capable of and has her spar against Changeling. Changeling, with his usual aplomb, transforms into a variety of animals, and circle about Terra, disrupting her concentration. He keeps making jokes and poking playful fun at her, not realizing that she each barb is steadily bringing her temper to a boil. Finally, Terra can take no more of Gar's shenanigans and unleashes a volley of earth, rocks and debris at him. Volcanic mounds of dirt begin erupting across the island, and the other Titans quickly realize that Terra has lost control. They finally get Terra to calm down, and they make sure that Gar is okay. Cyborg chastises him for provoking her.\nLater, Tara retires to theTerminator's secret lair. Slade criticizes her for losing control, and tells her that it is only through sheer naiveté that the Titans still trust her. Tara tells him not worry about anything.\nElsewhere, a middle-aged woman and her teenage son monitor Slade and Tara's actions. They take a surveillance photo of them boarding a helicopter. The woman is surprised that she was able to get close enough to Slade to photograph him. She whispers to herself, \"Slade, it's been a long time. But not long enough for you\".\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\n\n"

Okaaran civilization survived, and the Okaarans were changed by the radiation, becoming the stocky, fang-toothed Okaarans of the present time.[1]\nFor several millennia the Warlords have trained the best and the brightest children  in the Vegan star system in the art of combat. Their beliefs held that the art of war and the humanities should forever be entwined with one another. They instructed their charges to develop a deep sense of self worth, so they would always be cognizant of the value of life and what exactly they would be fighting for. They taught them how to love a friend and hate an enemy. They taught them compassion and compromise, but always with the caveat that when such emotions prevailed, the only recourse would be war. Those trained in the Okaaran combat arenas included theTamaraneansistersKoriand'randKomand'r, as well as futureOmega MenPrimusandKalista.\nThe Warlords of Okaara are renowned experts in all forms of martial combat. Their expertise extends beyond merely the art of killing, and includes the philosophy of combat and the humanities.\n\n\n"

Robin then aids Batman in capturing Warner.[184]Robin also aids Batman and Superman in capturing a gang of crooks when Superman's vulnerability to Red Kryptonite is temporarily transferred to Batman.[185]Robin would next work with Batman, Batwoman and Ace the Bat-Hound in stopping the Green Mask Bandits from exploiting Alpha the Experimental Man, a newly built artificial man.[186]When Superman is believed to be dying from Virus X, Robin joins Batman, Supergirl and theLegion of Super-Heroesin carrying out Superman's final wishes, however it turns out that Superman was only being affected by Kryptonite that was embedded in Jimmy Olsen's camera.[187]\nAs years passed on, Dick Grayson attended high school and continued his crime-fighting career as Robin, the teen wonder.[188]\nAlfred's apparent death\nRobin assisted Batman in the investigation of the crime-riddenGotham Villageand the capture of the crime boss,Roland Meacham.[189]They were later confronted by the Tri-State Gang, who murdered Alfred. Batman and Robin captured the thugs, but their loss couldn't be repaired. However, upon Alfred's demise, Dick Grayson'sAunt Harrietdecided to move to Wayne Manor to help Bruce and Dick with the daily chores.[190]Soon, Batman and Robin captured a wanted criminal, after being ambushed in an ancient English castle[191]and captured some foreign spies who incited violence among people.[192]Robin later assisted Batman in finding the criminals who stole his identity and teamed up with Ralph Dibny, theElongated Man.[193]\nAfter this, Robin was kidnapped by theGrasshopper Gang, who lured Batman into a trap. The heroes soon learned that these thugs have been working for the mysterious criminal known asThe Outsider.[194]Before they could investigate that case further, Batman and Robin had to capture the criminal known as theMake-Up Man[195]and stop the criminal activities of thePenguin.[196]It wasn't until Batman and Robin confronted and captured a mysterious witch, that the Outsider threatened them once again.[197]Shortly after this, Batman and Robin captured the elusiveGetaway Genius, after a series of unsuccessful attempts to nab the criminal.[198]\nBatman and Robin\nAfter this, a criminal from the past was released from prison. TheRiddlerreturned to Gotham, years after Batman and Robin captured him for the first time. He tried to trick the heroes into believing that he had reformed, but Batman deduced his real plans and captured the Riddler.[199]Afterwards, Robin captured the Flower Gang without Batman's assistance[200]and also stopped the Joker, with Batman's help.[201]Next, they confronted the masked criminal known asMr. Incognitoand later they stopped the monstrous criminal calledBlockbuster.[202]Robin then managed to capture the so-called Robin Gang,[203]and with Batman, they stopped the amazing criminal called, theBouncer, admittedly with a great effort.[204]Later, Batman and Robin had to fight against theCluemaster, a costumed criminal who tried to discover Batman's identity, but was ultimately captured by the heroes.[205]After this, Batman and Robin stopped the new criminal in town,Poison Ivy, although Robin had to force Batman to capture her as he was too charmed by her.[206]Robin proved to be helpful, even with serious hand injuries when he helped Batman capture the notorious enemy ofThe Flash, theWeather Wizard.[207]\nFinally, after months of indirect encounters, Batman and Robin confronted and defeated the Outsider, just to realize that it was their butler Alfred, all along. Alfred had been revived using experimental machines, which turned him into the Outsider, but after he was defeated, he returned to normal and resumed his activities as Bruce Wayne's butler.[208]\nRobin the wisecrack\nSoon after this, Batman was marked as Bruce Wayne into a mysterious murder chain and he left encoded clues for Robin to find.[209]Robin managed to deduce the meaning of Bruce's clue and he saved his mentor from a certain death, even though he failed to capture the criminal and was used as bait to lure Batman into a trap. Despite this drawback, Batman saved Robin and captured the criminal responsible.[210]\nBatman and Robin were constantly facing their usual enemies on several more occasions and they even confrontedScarecrow, who returned after years of inactivity.[211]The most recurrent villains that they confronted were Poison Ivy,[206]Joker,[212]Penguin,[213]Riddler,[214][215][216]Scarecrow[217]and Catwoman.[218][219]\nAfter the wave of costumed criminals waned, the Dynamic Duo had to stop regular mobsters and criminal masterminds such as Salvo, Chino[220]and theSchemer.[221]The heroes then staged Robin's death in order to capture a large smuggling gang.[222]\nEventually, Batman and Robin learned ofBatgirl, a new crime-fighter who adopted the mantle of the bat. At first, they refused her collaboration on crimes, but when she proved vital in capturingKiller Moth, Batman allowed her to keep working as their close ally.[223]\nWhen Batman was affected by a rare swamp fever, Batgirl teamed-up with Robin in order to prevent the Caped Crusader from accelerating the process of the illness by overworking himself. When the fever reached the most critical stage, Batman received attention as Bruce Wayne and during his absence, the Batgirl-Robin team prowled the streets of Gotham.[224]\nDick Grayson eventually graduated from high school and moved out of Wayne Manor to attendHudson University, leaving his partnership with Batman behind.[225]He would team-up with his mentor on certain occasions, but the Dynamic Duo was officially terminated.\nOn his first day atHudson University, Dick became aware of a plot to overthrow the authorities at campus by some radical students who started riots and hired thugs to pose as police officers.[226]After confronting the thugs as Robin, Dick revealed the complot to the rest of the students, allowing the real police to take away the criminals.[227]This would be the first of many adventures as Robin in the campus of Hudson University.[228][229][230]There were also certain times in which he had to work outside campus, looking for wanted criminals and solving mysteries.[231]\nBecause of his obligations, Dick had to divide his time between his studies and his work as Robin. This complicated things as Dick was also a member of the Teen Titans and he was always needed on various places around the same time.\nRobin \"Unleashed\"\nDick Grayson metTerri Bergstromat Hudson University and they started a friendly relationship.[232]Certain time, Robin went looking for a wanted felon along with Terri and they were forced to join a commune in order to find the fugitive and stop a wildfire started by the same person.[233][234]Unfortunately after this incident, Terry went missing and Robin started having mental images about her.[234]Shortly after, Robin realized that Terri was trying to contact him using her psychic powers.[235]\nFinally, Robin understood that Terri was trying to communicate withLilith Clay, a member of the Teen Titans and friend of Robin. Terri and Lilith were distant cousins who wanted to rejoin.[236]Unfortunately, the girls learned that their psychic powers combined, caused Terri's mind to weaken and be possessed by evil forces. Despite Robin's help, they had to remain separated in fear of harming Terri's mind.[237]\nAfter this event, Robin became more involved with the community at Hudson University and tried to improve it by working along with the students and local townsfolk, solving crimes and helping people in the community.[238][239][240][241][242]Eventually, theCavalierattempted to learn the location of the Batcave from Robin, but the Teen Wonder managed to fool the criminal and captured him, sending him to prison.[243]\nWhen Haly's Circus showed up in New Carthage, Robin was shocked to learn about a new act called \"The Flying Graysons\" and after investigating, he learned of a small-time crook part of the new group. In order to clear the name of his former team, Robin captured the criminal with help from the original Flying Graysons, present with him in his memory.[244]In the same fashion, Robin continued working in New Carthage, solving mysteries and crimes alongsideChief McDonald.[245]When Scarecrow showed up in New Carthage, Robin managed to stop him with McDonald's assistance.[246][247][248]\nEventually, Robin started datingLori Elton, a classmate at Hudson University.[249]However, his constant disappearances and his lack of dedication to his studies and his personal life caused Lori Elton to end their relationship.[250]Dick was certainly jealous of Lori's new boyfriend,Dave Corby, but he was distracted by the appearance of a new costumed villain called The Raven.[251]After trying a couple of new outfits from fans, Robin was once again attacked by The Raven, but this time he noticed a connection between an organized criminal gang.[252]Robin confronted The Raven a third time[253]and with help from Duela Dent, they managed to learn the secret location ofMAZE's headquarters, who were behind it all. Robin and Duela managed to round the criminal organization with help from the New Carthage Police Department, but The Raven escaped. Nevertheless, Robin knew the villain's secret identity and the next day, he confronted David Corby at the Hudson University campus as Dick Grayson. Corby was exposed as The Raven in front of everyone, including Lori Elton, who realized the mistake she had made, much too late. As Corby was taken by the authorities, Dick turned his back on Lori, ending their relationship for good and he moved onwards with his life.[254]\nAfter his relationship with Lori came to an end, Dick started dating a girl called Jennifer Ann, but his work was Robin made difficult to maintain a healthy relationship.[255]Especially when criminals like Penguin showed up in town.[256]When Robin learned that Bruce Wayne's lawyer had hired a spy to protect him, he travelled to Gotham and put an end to the charade.[257]After this, Robin realized that he was always meant to be in Gotham City and he dropped out of college, abandoning Hudson University and his relationship with Jennifer Ann.[258][259]\nFlirting Relation\nWhile at Hudson U, Dick noticed that Batgirl was investigating a murder case on the campus and he started following her as Robin.[260]He saved Batgirl from a death at the hands of the killer and together, they captured the criminal.[261]\nEventually, Dick Grayson was summoned to help Barbara Gordon in Washington, DC. It was at this point that Robin and Batgirl started teaming-up more frequently and a flirtatious relation between them started.[262]The next time they worked together was in Pricetown, where they had to solve the mystery behind living dinosaurs and ancient warriors. They eventually learned that it was all part of an illusion and during this adventure they learned each other's secret identities.[263]Afterwards, Robin and Batgirl stopped the criminal organizationMAZEfrom murdering a foreign Princess, in what would be the first encounter against the hired killers.[264]\nRobin and Batgirl were then kidnapped byHuntressandSportsmasterand forced to compete against each other. The young heroes, however, managed to turn the table against the crooks and captured them with team-work.[265]When Barbara went to Hudson University to give a speech, Robin learned that someone had stolen the plaque award for Barbara and working together with Batgirl, they recovered the stolen prize.[266]\nAfterwards, Robin tricked MAZE and prepared a set-up to capture a large faction of the organization along with Batgirl's help.[267]Shortly after this, Robin and Batgirl were lured to a trap inNew York City, where they teamed-up withMan-Batin order to defeat the menace of theOutsider. It was during this caper that Robin opened up about his feelings for Barbara, telling her that he loved her, but due to exhaustion, she fell asleep during his confession.[268]\nRight after the last mission, Robin was called by Batgirl and they started searching for a cure to the virus that caused Batwoman to disintegrate and was highly contagious.[269]Later, Robin teamed-up with Batgirl once again to put an end to theFive-In-One Foe's crimes.[270]When a new villain created a massive emergency in Washington, Robin went down to help Batgirl against thePower Sowerand with help fromRed Tornadoand Elongated Man, they stopped the villain's evil scheme.[271]Working on a drug smuggling ring, Barbara was drugged and manipulated by an evil scientist who erased her memories. Robin helped Barbara recover most of her memories, but they agreed that she should not remember Batman and Robin's true identities for the time being.[272]\nRobin is The Demon's Victim\nWhile studying at college, Dick had very few opportunities to work alongside Batman and every time they worked together, it was mostly out of necessity and by chance. During a summer vacation, Dick became interested in solving the alleged death of a famous musician and he asked Batman to help him solve the case.[273]Shortly after, Robin was kidnapped by the Dynamic Duo's old enemy,Dr. Tzin-Tzin, who used Robin to lure Batman into a deadly trap.[274]This scenario would repeat once when Robin was kidnapped by the secret society known as the Brotherhood of the Demon and he was used as bait to lure Batman to their hideout in the Himalayas. Robin was kept in the dark, but unharmed for a few days until Batman arrived and rescued his young partner. They worked together again to take down the members of the Brotherhood, but Robin soon learned that it was all part of a plan from the Brotherhood's secret leader,Ra's al Ghul, who wanted to test Batman before giving him his empire and his daughter,Talia.[275]\nAfterwards, Dick and some friends attended the Rutland Halloween Parade, but Dick was forced to confront a costumed killer known asThe Reaperand failed to stop him. Batman had to save Robin and started working to capture the killer.[276]Robin then helped Batman by posing as the waterfront gangster,Matches Malone, while Batman gathered a team to defeat Ra's al Ghul.[277]Not long after this, Robin was rescued by Batman from a criminal known as The Butcher, who tried to murder Robin by beheading him.[278]In New Year's Eve, Robin assisted Batman during an ongoing investigation to capture a criminal who threatened Gotham with releasing nerve gas. Batman, Robin and Alfred eventually managed to stop the crook.[279]When Robin went investigating the murder of a circus acrobat, he was soon joined by Batman and together they managed to capture the culprit along with Catwoman, who reappeared after a long time of inactivity.[280]\nFighting The Riddler\nAfter this, Robin was kidnapped by a criminal called theJudge, whose main idea was to lure Batman into a trap and use Robin as bait. The Judge succeeded in luring Batman into his trap, but while the Dark Knight confronted the Judge, Robin broke free and helped Batman capture the Judge.[281]When Robin learned about Bruce's \"strange\" behaviour, he investigated and discovered that Bruce and Alfred had been captured by the notorious criminal, ProfessorHugo Strange. Robin rescued Bruce and Alfred and he defeated most of Strange'sMonster Menand his female accomplice as well.[282]\nAfter this, Robin worked with Batman to save Lori Elton from a criminal known asScar, who had kidnapped Lori and planned to disfigure her face.[283]During his Summer vacation in Gotham, Robin joined Batman and they stopped theCrazy Quilt, accidentally leaving him blind.[284]\nBatman and Robin continued their occasional team-up and they stopped most of the regular criminals of Gotham such as Two-Face,[285]the Joker,[286][287]the Penguin,[288][289]the Riddler,[290][291]and regular criminals.[292]\nRobin made his comeback permanent after he dropped out of college, but Batman was not too happy about his return.[293]With tensions growing between them, Robin decided to leave Bruce's partnership when he allowed Talia to stay with him at the Wayne Foundation Penthouse.[294]Suspecting that Talia had ulterior reasons, Robin sought the help from a reformed Catwoman to find the truth.[295]Robin and Catwoman continued working and they were eventually contacted byKing Faradayand summoned toShanghaito assist him during an investigation. Once there, Robin and Catwoman were captured by a crime lord, who planned to have them killed.[296]Catwoman and Robin escaped and rescued King Faraday before they went toInfinity Island, where they were captured by Ra's al Ghul.[297]Robin and the others were eventually rescued by Batman and they all returned to Gotham after Ra's defeat. After the whole affair, Bruce and Dick became a team once again, if only temporarily.[298]\nAfter this event, Robin was contacted by Alfred in order to help Batman with a fear related problem. Robin enlisted Batgirl's help and they located the Scarecrow, who was responsible for drugging Batman with a variation of his fear toxin. Although Robin and Batgirl were captured by the Scarecrow, their information was vital for Batman to stop the Scarecrow and save them.[299]\nAfter this events, Dick joinedHill's Circusas part of the the trapeze act and he helped his friends solve various crimes.[300][301]On his way back to Gotham, Robin solved a few more crimes by himself.[302][303][304]Finally, Robin returned to Gotham and joined Batman once more in what would be his last tenure as Robin. During this short stint, Robin assisted Batman against supervillains like Poison Ivy,[305]Dr. Death,[306]and Two-Face.[307]\nDick also resumed his studies, but this time he attended Gotham University, where he met a woman calledDala.[308]Although they started dating,[306]Dick became suspicious when she started acting like there was nothing between them.[309]During this time, Dick joined Bruce and Alfred and they all moved back to Wayne Manor,[310]but Dick was still concerned about Dala. He followed her as Robin to a mysterious old house in the middle of nowhere, where he was knocked unconscious by a hooded figure.[311]When he recovered, Robin learned that Dala and her companion, theMonkwere vampires and he was bitten by her.[312]Robin soon became a mindless slave of Dala and he caused Batman to fall into a trap at the Monk's place.[313]Once Batman transformed into a vampire, he trapped Dick[314]and found a cure to revert the curse.[315]\nThis section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information, expanding on the subject matter in order to bring this article to a higher standard of quality.\nDuring his final days as Robin, Dick worked with Batman and stopped the evilColonel Blimp,[316][317]Ra's al Ghul,[318]Hugo Strange,[319]andRupert Thorne.[320]After this, Dick became friends with a family of trapeze artist and he introduced the Todds to Bruce.[321]When Dick learned that Sloan Circus was being blackmailed by a new criminal calledKiller Croc,[322]he organized a plan with the Todds that would help him nail the crook.[323]Unfortunately, the Todds were killed by Croc and their son,Jasonwas left an orphan. At first, Dick wanted to adopt him, but Bruce had other plans in mind.[324]\nAfter a short time, Dick realized that he could no longer keep his Robin identity while leading the Teen Titans. Robin was always going to be Batman's sidekick and for this reason, he decided to drop this identity and allowed Jason to become the new Robin and continue his legacy. However, as he made this decision, Dick started looking for a new identity, one that he could claim for himself and make his own.[325][326]\nThere are a number of imaginary tales that have been told about the Earth-One Robin. These stories are not part of Earth-One canon. The following is a complete list of the imaginary tales:\nThe first imaginary tale about the Earth-One Robin was told written by Batman's butler Alfred Pennyworth. In this imaginary story Alfred tells a tale about Batman and Batwoman getting married and retiring together, leaving Dick Grayson to take up the mantle of Batman II while the role of Robin II is taken up by Bruce Wayne Jr.[327]Alfred revisits this idea in another imaginary story about Batman II and Robin II wherein they stop criminal John Crandall.[142]This starts a regular trend of imaginary tales about Robin's future life after Batman has been married. In another imaginary tale written by Alfred about Batman II and Robin II, the new Dynamic Duo battle the Joker and his son.[171]Alfred would revisit this imaginary world one more time to tell how Bruce Wayne Jr. would aid Dick Grayson against the Green Owl Gang.[328]\nAnother common theme of imaginary tales involving Robin usually have to do with changes in the life of longtime Batman associate Superman. In the first of these Robin appears in an imaginary tale about Lex Luthor supposedly going straight and aiding Superman in his crime-fighting endeavors. This, however, is all a plot by Luthor to kill Superman, a plot which Superman's greatest foe succeeds at. Robin is seen attending the funeral of Superman with the Man of Steels many friends and associates.[329]Another imaginary tale regarding the wedding anniversary of Superman and Lois Lane depicts Robin being present at the anniversary.[330]\nBefore he and Earth-One were erased by theCrisis on Infinite Earths, his Gotham was taken byBrainiacandTelosand he is trapped for a year. About half a year after being trapped, he married Starfire. Before the dome went down, he and Starfire stop a robbery and end up fighting when Starfire decides to try to kill the robbers. He and the Titans fight the Earth-9Doom Patrol, which ends with Cyborg being injured. He is contacted by Lourdes, who seeks to strike a deal with him.[331]\n\n\n\nThis character is or was an incarnation of or an ally ofBatman, and a member of theBatman Family.

As a magical mirror duplicate ofWonder Woman, she is considered her sister.\nDonna was created to be a playmate for the youngWonder Womanby the sorceressMagala, who used a magical mirror to create a duplicate of Diana, though with her own personality. She was abducted byDark Angelwho mistook her for the real Diana, and cursed her to experience a cycle of countless tragic lives, given the name Donna Troy as a cruel joke to her origins. But it would not be until the intervention of Wonder Woman,Hippolyta, andthe Flashyears later that she would learn this.\nWho is Donna Troy?\nIn one of the lives she ended up living, Donna was orphaned by her birth mother,Dorothy Hinckley, a dying unwed teen who had given her up for adoption. After Donna's adoptive father Carl Stacey was killed in a work-related accident, her adoptive motherFay Staceygave her up for adoption again, unable to raise the toddler because of mounting expenses. Donna remembered being rescued from a fire by the goddessRheawho, being one of the mythological Titans, brought her toNew Cronusand raised her as one of twelveTitan Seeds, orphans from various planets who would have died if Rhea had not saved them. Each one was given the name of a place that worshiped the Titans, and Donna was given the last name of Troy in homage to the ancient city. She was returned to Earth at age thirteen, where her memories of New Cronus were erased until such a time that she would return and take her place among the Seeds as gods.\nWhen Donna experienced having superhuman powers and abilities, she adopted the identity of Wonder Girl. Donna became one of the founding members of theTeen Titans, even suggesting the name of the group from a residual memory.\nShe marriedTerry Long, a college professor, and soon became pregnant. This incited theTeam Titansgroup from the future to confront her, claiming that her son would threaten the future asLord Chaos. Donna voluntarily gave up her powers to prevent this. She later requested for her powers to be returned but was denied.[3]She was inducted into theDarkstarsand rejoined the Teen Titans as a Darkstar.[4]Terry later divorced Donna citing that her superhero role put the family in danger and gained sole custody of their son.[5]She turned to teammateKyle Raynerfor comfort, but left him after Terry,RobertandJenny Long, (Terry's daughter from his first marriage) were killed in a tragic car accident.[6]\nThe tragedy caused Dark Angel to appear and make Donna start anew with a totally different life, causing everyone but Hippolyta and Wally West to forget her existence as the Donna Troy who became Wonder Girl and Troia. Together with Wonder Woman, Hippolyta and Wally helped restore the life of Donna Troy, breaking her out of the curse that Dark Angel had bound her to. She was then adopted as a daughter of Hippolyta. Consequently, Hippolyta decreed that Donna, as her daughter, would be granted the privilege of a royal station and a title. As such, a coronation was held and Donna was thereafter referred to as Princess Donna amongst theAmazons.\nAn android namedIndigoappeared, badly damaged and in need of repair. In her attempts to repair herself and call for aid from other androids, she caused aSuperbotto go rogue during a meeting of the Teen Titans andYoung Justice; Donna andOmenwere killed during the attempts to stop it.[7]\nDonna Troy had discovered that, like every other person after thedestruction of the multiverse, she was an amalgam of every alternate version of Donna Troy in the formerrealities. Unlike everyone else, Donna was the repository of knowledge of every alternate universe version of herself. She learned that her counterpart onEarth-Twowas saved by a firefighter and raised in an orphanage, while herEarth-Scounterpart died in the fire. She also discovered that her sworn enemy of the past, Dark Angel, was in fact the Donna Troy ofEarth-Seven, saved from certain death by theAnti-Monitor, just like theMonitorhad savedHarbinger. When the parallel realities were condensed into one, Dark Angel, who had somehow escaped the compression of every Donna Troy into one single person on the new Earth, sought to kill her. Every life she forced Donna to relive was, in fact, an aspect of an alternate Donna, as a way to avoid the merging and remain the last one standing. When she was defeated, Donna became the real sum of every Donna Troy that existed on every Earth, a living key to the lost Multiverse.\nDonna had been reborn after her death at the hands of the Superman android. TheTitans of Myth, realizing that she was the child who was destined to save them from some impending threat, brought her to New Cronus and implanted false memories within her mind to make her believe she was the originalGoddess of the Moonand wife ofCoeus. The Titans of Myth incited war between other worlds near New Cronus in order to gain new worshippers. They used the combined power of their collective faith to open a passageway into another reality, where they would be safe from destruction. Donna was another means to that end, until she was found by the Titans andThe Outsiderswho restored her true memories. This was not without casualties, however.Sparta, who was restored to full mental health and stripped of the bulk of her power, had been made an officer in the Titans of Myth's royal military. She was sacrificed by the Titans of Myth in an attempt to lay siege to the planet, Minosyss, which housed aSun-Eaterfactory miles beneath its surface. Sparta's death had inadvertently helped trigger Donna's memory restoration.Athynshad also reappeared by this time, and aided the heroes and the Mynossian resistance in battling the Titans of Myth. It was then thatHyperion, the Titan of the Sun, revealed Donna's true origins to her and ordered her to open a passageway into another reality by means of a dimensional nexus that once served as a gateway to the Multiverse itself, within the Sun-Eater factory's core. This turned out to be the Titans of Myth's real target. Donna did so, but fearing they would simply continue with their power-mad ambitions, she banished most of them intoTartarus. However, Hyperion, and his wifeThia, were warned of the deception at the last moment. Enraged, they turned on Donna, intending to kill her for the betrayal, but Coeus activated the Sun-Eater to save her andArsenal. As the Sun-Eater began absorbing their vast solar energies, Hyperion and Thia tried to escape through the Nexus, but they were both torn apart by the combined forces of the Nexus' dimensional pull and the Sun-Eater's power. Coeus, who had learned humility and compassion from Donna, vowed to guard the gateway to make certain the other Titans of Myth remained imprisoned forever. After this, Donna gained all knowledge of her alternate selves and was entrusted with theUniverse Orbby Harbinger.\nMain article:Infinite Crisis\nDonna led a group of heroes to New Cronus to deal with a rip in space caused byAlexander Luthor, attacking him through the rift. The team suffered loss, including the death ofJadeand several others who went missing. Donna also procured a \"red sun eater\" in order to defeatSuperboy-Prime. Afterwards, Donna returned to New Cronus where she analyzed the history of the universe as it had been recorded in Harbinger's old Universe Orb.[8]\nMain article:One Year Later\nAs Wonder Woman\nDonna Troy assumed the mantle of Wonder Woman. Diana stepped down, feeling the need to \"find out who Diana is\". In the midst of a fight withCheetahandGiganta, Donna was overwhelmed whenDoctor Psychomanipulated her into believing that Diana was attacking her with deadly force. At the same time, Diana, posing as a government agent, arrived on the scene. Circe is behind the attacks and capture.\nDonna worked alongside ex-boyfriendKyle Rayner, who had taken up the powers and title ofIonagain. They fought against one of theMonitorswho attempted to remove them from the newly rebuilt time-stream, claiming the two were unwanted anomalies. Donna returned to earth with Ion in time for him to say good-bye to his dyingmother.\nDonna later joined several formerTeen Titansin their battle againstDeathstrokeand hisTitans Eastteam.\nDonna soon after attendedDuela Dent'sfuneral with the Teen Titans. After the burial, she was confronted byJason Todd, who sought her out as a kindred spirit. She repeatedly ran into the helpful Jason while trying to investigate Duela's murder. Her investigation was put on hold once she discovered the Amazons had invadedWashington, D.C.She travelled to the city and confronted the recently revivedHippolytato put a stop to the invasion. The Amazon Queen informed her that she would consider a withdrawal, only if Donna could include Diana in the peace talks, Donna left to find her sister, discovering that Jason Todd had followed her to Washington as well. Jason told Donna that he believed the Monitors were responsible for Duela's death, but before anything else could be done, both warriors were attacked by the Monitor's aide,Forerunner. They were consequently saved by the seemingly benevolent \"Bob,\" and recruited to help locateRay Palmer. Their journey took them across the expanse of the new Multiverse, whereupon they were also joined by Donna's former boyfriend,Green Lanternas well as Ray Palmer's successorRyan Choi. This loose confederation of adventurers became known as theChallengers from Beyond. After several haphazard missions in theNanoverse, they eventually found Palmer in the parallel reality known asEarth-51. Shortly thereafter, their colleague Bob the Monitor betrayed them, and Earth-51 was destroyed as a result of theMorticoccus Virus. With Palmer in tow, the Challengers eventually returned to their home dimension. Donna, Ray and Kyle agreed that with the growing individuality of the fifty-two existing Monitors, there was too much room for corruption. They all agreed to serve as a watchdog group in order to \"Monitor the Monitors\".[9]\nReturning to Earth, Donna reunited with her old teammates the Titans.

The story was written and edited by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez with artwork by Pérez, Romeo Tanghal, Dick Giordano, Mike DeCarlo and Adrienne Roy. Lettering was provided by Ben Oda, Bob La, John Costanza and Todd Klein. All four issues were collected in the 1988New Teen Titans: The Judas Contracttrade paperback. Among readers, this storyline is often times cited as the pinnacle of Wolfman and Pérez' run on the title. \"The Judas Contract\" is the culmination of a sub-plot that began as early asNew Teen Titans#2 with the introduction of theTerminatorand theH.I.V.E.\n\"The Judas Contract\" is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it reveals the secret origin of Deathstroke the Terminator, arguably the Titans' most notorious adversary. It also brings to a close the Terminator's extended contract with the H.I.V.E. The destruction of the H.I.V.E. is revealed soon after in a follow-up story which takes place inTales of the Teen Titans#45-47. Deathstroke's partner in crime in this epic,Terra, was introduced in the pages ofNew Teen Titans#26. She made regular appearances throughout the title and had just been approved for membership to the team when it was revealed that she was secretly working for the Terminator. One of the more controversial elements revealed in this story was the fact that the Terminator and Terra had been having a sexual affair. (it should be noted that while the Terminator is obviously a middle-aged man, Terra is only sixteen-years-old). \"The Judas Contract\" is also noted for the introduction of Deathstroke's ex-wife, Adeline, but more importantly, it introduces his second son Joey Wilson. Immediately following the events of \"The Judas Contract\", Joey Wilson adopts the code nameJerichoand becomes a regular member of the Teen Titans.Adeline Kaneremains a stable supporting character and has made frequent appearances in bothNew Teen Titans (Volume 2)andTeen TitansSpotlight. In addition, this storyline presents the first appearance of Dick Grayson under his new costume and code-nameNightwing, having left the legacy of Robin forever behind him.\n\"The Judas Contract\" begins shortly after Dick Grayson and Wally West officially retire from active service. Though no longer calling himself Robin, Dick is still intrinsically involved in Titans activity. The group's most recent protégé Terra Markov, is not a full-fledged Titan, but has certainly won the heart and mind of Changeling. None of the Titans suspect that she has been secretly spying on them on behalf of her partner the Terminator. Terra has been feeding Terminator important information regarding the Titans including their secret identities. During a training exercise, the Titans begin to learn how mentally unstable Terra truly is. After enduring numerous playful barbs from Changeling, she unleashes a massive attack that nearly cripples him. The other Titans calm her down, but it is Raven who realizes that there is something seriously dangerous about this girl.\nOnce Terra acquires all of the information she needs, she informs the Terminator who then systematically takes down each of the Titans. He first strikes at the apartment penthouse shared by Donna Troy and Kory Anders. He incapacitates Kory with a high-yield letter bomb, and renders Donna unconscious with a gas mixture that he adds to her darkroom chemicals. He then takes out Cyborg by electrifying a chair in his apartment. The high voltage shorts out Vic's systems long enough for Deathstroke to collect him. He then tries to take down Dick Grayson at his apartment, but is surprised when the one non-powered Titan manages to elude him. Frustrated, he goes to the Hamptons to take down that last Titan, Changeling. Changeling licks a stack of envelope seals treated with a special poison that renders him unconscious. With all but one of the Titans captured, he brings them to the Rocky Mountain headquarters of his employers, the H.I.V.E. Deathstroke is satisfied that he has completed the contract left behind by his late son Grant, but the H.I.V.E. criticize him for failing to bring them Robin.\nMeanwhile, Dick Grayson, having discovered that all of his former teammates have been captured returns to Titans Tower. There he is greeted by Adeline Kane, the Terminator's ex-wife. She introduces him to her mute son Joey. Adeline tells Dick that Terra is a traitor to the team and has been secretly working with her husband since the moment the Titans first met her. Dick is incredulous at first, but slowly believes Adeline's story after she provides him a comprehensive history on Slade Wilson and the means by which he became the Terminator. Adeline's son Joey, a mutant at birth, possesses the power to possess other people, and he is eager to help Dick rescue the Titans. Realizing that he can never truly retire from super-heroing, Dick adopts a new costume and identity and calls himself Nightwing while Joey is also ready to follow him into battle as Jericho. Adeline then gives the heroes the location of the H.I.V.E. command center.\nNightwing and Jericho go the H.I.V.E. base nestled in the Rocky Mountains. They sneak into the facility and discover that the Titans have been strapped to a giant machine which is slowly siphoning away their life energy. Nightwing and Jericho fight through a horde of H.I.V.E. shock troops but are eventually captured. The Terminator is surprised to see his son with the Titans and tries to bargain with the H.I.V.E. to let him go. The H.I.V.E. refuses however and Jericho takes this opportunity to possess his own father. Using the Terminator's body and weaponry, he frees the other Titans and begins fighting the H.I.V.E. Terra is enraged at Terminator and feels that his affection for Joey makes him weak. She loses complete control of her sanity and yearns for nothing more than the death of everyone in the room. Changeling refuses to believe that Terra has gone bad, and is certain that the Terminator has brainwashed her. Terra's powers rage out of control until finally she causes a mountain of earth and debris to collapse down from the ceiling, killing herself in the process.\nThe Titans bring Terra's body back to New York for burial. The funeral service is small and only the Titans and the Outsiders are in attendance. The Titans let Terra's brother, Geo-Force, believe that she died heroically while fighting the H.I.V.E.\n\n"

Ko-Gar comes out of the cockpit with a loaded gun and demands that Richards and Fisher turn over the Scepter of Bast as well as the ancient parchment he attempted to steal from the Professor. While their foe has the upper hand, Reed points out that even though the plane is on autopilot it would not be able to take into account the migratory pattern of ducks. No sooner has Reed explains all this do a flock of these birds end up hitting the plane causing it to shift in the air. Reed and Francesca take this distraction to disarm Ko-Gar, and Reed then ejects their attacker out of the plane through the cabin door. With the pilots dead and the plane damaged, Reed takes the controls and lands the plane at the nearest airport.\nNot long after the landing Reed and Fisher are pulled into airport security where they are questioned about what happened on the flight for hours. Suddenly the interrogation is interrupted by Reed's old flame Alyssa Moy. She manages to convince the officers to leave her alone with their prisoners. Just as Reed is explaining to Francesca who Alyssa is, Moy jumps onto Reed's lap and kisses him. She then informs them that she has made arrangements to get them out of police custody and hopes that wherever they're taking her is more interesting than the three day old party she just left. Francesca is unimpressed with Alyssa and even less enthused by the woman inviting herself on their search. Going over the information that Reed and Francesca gathered, Alyssa points out that there is no point in going to Egypt until they make a stop in Romania first where the Eye of Bast -- another portion of the Claw -- is being kept in a museum. Although Reed agrees to take Alyssa along with them, Francesca takes a huge disliking to her almost immediately.\nMeanwhile, at the Romaian castle that served as the home of Victor von Doom at the time, Doom is reciting his plans to claim the Claw of Bast and use it to restore his scarred face and gain immortality so that he might take over the world. He explains his plans to his assistant Radu, who hasn't come to fear Doom yet, but feels that he will. Sometime later on a train to Bucharest, Alyssa and Francesca are left alone in their quarters together. The two get into another argument over their true motivations for going on this trip, both implying their attractions to Reed Richards, but neither woman admitting it. They abruptly stop their squabble when Reed enters the room to see how things are going.\nIt's at this point that Franklin interrupts his fathers telling of the story, pointing out how difficult it would be that he could know details about what Doctor Doom and the women were saying and doing when he wasn't around. Reed pretends to be wounded by these accusations that he is making up his story, but when he suggests ending the story Franklin insists that he finishes it. Reed then continues where he left off...\nAt the museum Reed learns that Alyssa intends to steal the Eye of Bast from the private collections. When he is hesitant about this plan, she explains that she is putting a glass replica in its place. As the trio bicker over the ethics of stealing the artefact, Reed suddenly hears noise coming from outside. As it turns out Ko-Gar and Doom's followers have stormed the museum seeking the Eye of Bast. Appraising the situation, Reed suggests they escape out the window and uses one of his chemical spheres to eat through the bars with acid. As Reed and Alyssa climb out the window, Francesca is grabbed by Ko-Gar. Outside, Reed hears the gang of thugs order Reed's capture for their master and Reed realises that his old rival Victor von Doom is also after the Claw of Bast. While Reed and Alyssa make a clean getaway, Moy suggests they continue on without Francesca. Reed points out that he can't leave her to suffer at the hands of Von Doom. Alyssa is forced to agree with him to mount a rescue mission when she realises that Fisher has scroll to find the third piece of the Claw of Bast.\nAt Doom's castle, Francesca is brought before Victor and demands to be set free. Doom boasts that he will soon be ruler of the world and best his old rival Reed Richards. As he explains his hatred for Richards, Doom is unaware that his foe and Alyssa are watching things transpire from a secret passage behind a painting that demonises Reed Richards. Reed suggests the need to be stealthy, but the sudden appearance of a rat frightens Alyssa enough that she knocks the two of them through the painting and out into the open. Quickly taken prisoner, Reed tries to give Doom the fate Eye of Bast, but Victor sees through this ruse and crushes it. Doom then informs Reed that instead of out right killing him, he is going to present a challenge to him. Still believing that the calculations for the device that blew up in his face were correct he challenges Reed to prove him wrong. Reed is willing to put his life on the line to prove himself right, but that's when Doom tells him that instead of Reed's possible death, it will be that of his female companions..."

Here the thinks about the pain that was caused in the bomb explosion that was his birth. However, his mind draws back to the dim memories of Bruce Banner, of his abusive father and his protective mother and explodes into a tearful rage.\nAt that moment in New York City, the She-Hulk's deep thoughts draw concern from the Avenger's leader the Wasp. When she asks Jennifer what's wrong, the She-Hulk tells Janet that she is thinking about her cousin, the Hulk. She tells the Wasp about how she has been feeling sorry for herself over the past few days and while she usually pulls herself out of these kinds of funks, she can't help but think about how difficult that must be for Bruce Banner. She tells Janet about how she was fighting a legal battle for the Hulk and it looked like they were going to win. However, suddenly, the case was over, no appeals, no recourse, nothing. Using her connections as an Avenger she found no reasonable explanation as to why. Knowing all of this, she can't help but wonder if her cousin feels alone or afraid.\nAt that moment, the Hulk is making his way to New York City, and his arrival is picked up on the seismographs in Avengers Mansion. The Vision reports this to Iron Man who goes to Central Park to investigate. There he discovers the Hulk on a rampage and requests back-up. Soon Iron Man is joined by Giant-Man, Triathalon, the Wasp, Warbird, the Vision, Scarlet Witch and She-Hulk. When the Avengers debate on how to handle the situation, She-Hulk decides to try and reason with her cousin. However, the Hulk doesn't want to talk and attacks his cousin. As the rest of the Avengers scramble to pull her out of harms way, the Vision starts accessing behavioral databases to try and find some reason for the Hulk's current behavior.\nWith the She-Hulk pulled to safety, the rest of the Avengers battle the Hulk as the Scarlet Witch generates the necessary chaos magic to try and subdue the man-monster. The other Avengers are no match for the boundless fury of the Hulk, but their attacks give Wanda sufficient time to complete her spell and blast the Hulk with it. The magics cause the Hulk untold agony as he is forced to relive happy memories of his late wife Betty Ross. This causes the Hulk to revert back to Bruce Banner. When She-Hulk tries to approach her cousin, Bruce begins to panic and turns into the Hulk once more. The Hulk knocks his cousin aside and the battle begins anew. By this point, the Vision has collected the data he needs and tells the Scarlet Witch that the Hulk is not angry, but showing off. Based on data he has compiled on the courting rituals of the baboon, the Vision concludes that the Hulk is being overly aggressive because he is trying to impress a suitable mate through superiority and submission.\nWhen they realize that the Hulk is using the same tactics to impress one of his own kind, they realize that he is doing this all for the She-Hulk. This disturbing turn of events leads Jennifer to realize just how confused the Hulk really is and decides to try one more time to stare him down. This causes the Hulk to think of both Betty and Jarella, the two women he loved most and lost. When the Hulk tries to show off his aggression to She-Hulk, she merely turns her back on him. When the Hulk tries to get her to accept that he is the strongest there is, she flat out rejects him. This rejection makes the Hulk sad, as he doesn't want to be alone anymore. She-Hulk goes to comfort the brute, gently telling him it will never be because they are cousins. She tries to tell him that even though she can never love him in a way that he wants, she still cares. This makes the Hulk angry and he eventually gets fed up and leaps away. When Iron Man tries to follow after him, She-Hulk tells him to leave the Hulk alone, tearfully telling her teammates they should honor the Hulk's most requested demand this one time: leave him alone.\nVarious flashbacks in this story have an impact on the chronology of characters as follows:Page  4:Young Bruce Banner plays with his toy blocks\nPage 10, Panel 1:She-Hulk in court\nPage 10, Panel 2:She-Hulk outside courthouse"

They are using various subjects, such as spiders, on the OZ project. As Norman has to talk with his lawyer over the phone urgently, his assistant fails to cap the container on the spider case, and the arachnid escapes. Elsewhere, in Queens,Peter Parkerreads a chemistry book in a mall food court. As he tries to study, some rowdy teenagers pester him by throwing food. A sympathetic red-head (Mary Jane Watson) looks on with sadness. Before the other teens can stir up more trouble, Peter's uncle,Ben Parker, shows up and wrangles Mary Jane into a conversation with Peter and him.\nThe \"OZ\" Incident\nThe next day at his public school, Peter is further instigated by Flash and his big friend, but Harry Osborn shows up and helps the guys to leave Peter alone. Peter and Harry are friends even though Harry is on the team with the other lugs. Later that evening, Ben and May Parker discuss the possibility that Peter may have S.A.D., but Peter just shrugs it off. Harry comes by so they can study and it is revealed Peter's parents had died in a plane crash. When Peter trails off about an adhesive invention his father had worked on before dying, Harry ends up leaving. Norman is too busy to be bothered with Harry when he tries to remind his father his class will be in the lab the next day. As the class is going through Osborn Industries, Peter is bitten on the hand by the same spider shown at the beginning. Even though he has a seizure, he recovers after blacking out. Norman has a meeting to discuss what to do about Peter, decides to pay his hospital bill, and notes that we wants to keep an eye on the boy.\nIn school the next day, the heckling continues but as Flash's pal Kong is about to trip Peter, Peter reacts instinctively and flattens him onto the ground. Peter faints again and is taken to the hospital. He has blood taken, but the sample is replaced by one of Osborn's men. As Norman examines the blood, he notices the toxins will kill Peter. He decides to send his goon Shaw to kill him before that happens, so that no one finds out he died because of his Oscorp. When Shaw tries to run down Peter with his car, Peter reacts for some reason (Spider Sense), and leaps over the car. When Shaw reports back in, Norman aborts the kill so that he may study the boy further. Peter begins to research and realize the spider has affected him somehow. After a confrontation with May and Ben, Peter wakes up in the middle of the night and tries to climb the wall. The issue ends with Peter hanging upside down from the ceiling.\n[[ru:Ultimate Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}\n{{cl|pt-br:Ultimate Homem-Aranha Vol 1 1]]"

She shows Hela that Hogun lies at death's edge.  Hela goes to Midgard to claim him, but Thor holds her off.  Summoning a pair of lightning strikes, he strikes them at Hogun to act as a defibrillator unit to start his heart again.  It manages to work, but his life hangs by the thinnest threads.  Christine arrives in an ambulance, and Thor tells her that she needs to get him to the hospital quickly, and Volstagg and Fandral ride with her, while he goes to tend to the Wrecking Crew.  On the trip there, Christine realizes something.  How did Thor know her name?  In Svartalfheim, Jagrfelm is overjoyed by the possession of the Cask of Ancient Winters.  But his happiness does not last long.  The Dark Elves crash through his home and run him through.  He dies never knowing that the Cask has been reclaimed by Malekith.  Back on Earth, they rush in with the critical Hogun straight to Jane Foster, who preps him.  In Asgard, Sif is sitting by the sleeping Odin's side, wondering why he chose her over any of the others.  Balder arrives to tell her that Hogun lies near death.  They go to the Flame of Truth to see, and she summons Neffethesk.  Thor locates the Wrecking Crew, who have taken over a mansion and are having the maid and butler wait on them.  Thor secretly pulls them out of harms way, and then confronts them, sending a lightning strike into the pool where they are lounging, and directly striking Thunderball.  They notice that they've never seen Thor so angry before, as he begins to rip through them like a Category 5 hurricane.  Before he finishes them off, a vision of Sif appears in the pool, telling him that Neffethesk labors to prepare a cure for Hogun, and Thor races to Asgard to be there when it's ready."

Here the thinks about the pain that was caused in the bomb explosion that was his birth. However, his mind draws back to the dim memories of Bruce Banner, of his abusive father and his protective mother and explodes into a tearful rage.\nAt that moment in New York City, the She-Hulk's deep thoughts draw concern from the Avenger's leader the Wasp. When she asks Jennifer what's wrong, the She-Hulk tells Janet that she is thinking about her cousin, the Hulk. She tells the Wasp about how she has been feeling sorry for herself over the past few days and while she usually pulls herself out of these kinds of funks, she can't help but think about how difficult that must be for Bruce Banner. She tells Janet about how she was fighting a legal battle for the Hulk and it looked like they were going to win. However, suddenly, the case was over, no appeals, no recourse, nothing. Using her connections as an Avenger she found no reasonable explanation as to why. Knowing all of this, she can't help but wonder if her cousin feels alone or afraid.\nAt that moment, the Hulk is making his way to New York City, and his arrival is picked up on the seismographs in Avengers Mansion. The Vision reports this to Iron Man who goes to Central Park to investigate. There he discovers the Hulk on a rampage and requests back-up. Soon Iron Man is joined by Giant-Man, Triathalon, the Wasp, Warbird, the Vision, Scarlet Witch and She-Hulk. When the Avengers debate on how to handle the situation, She-Hulk decides to try and reason with her cousin. However, the Hulk doesn't want to talk and attacks his cousin. As the rest of the Avengers scramble to pull her out of harms way, the Vision starts accessing behavioral databases to try and find some reason for the Hulk's current behavior.\nWith the She-Hulk pulled to safety, the rest of the Avengers battle the Hulk as the Scarlet Witch generates the necessary chaos magic to try and subdue the man-monster. The other Avengers are no match for the boundless fury of the Hulk, but their attacks give Wanda sufficient time to complete her spell and blast the Hulk with it. The magics cause the Hulk untold agony as he is forced to relive happy memories of his late wife Betty Ross. This causes the Hulk to revert back to Bruce Banner. When She-Hulk tries to approach her cousin, Bruce begins to panic and turns into the Hulk once more. The Hulk knocks his cousin aside and the battle begins anew. By this point, the Vision has collected the data he needs and tells the Scarlet Witch that the Hulk is not angry, but showing off. Based on data he has compiled on the courting rituals of the baboon, the Vision concludes that the Hulk is being overly aggressive because he is trying to impress a suitable mate through superiority and submission.\nWhen they realize that the Hulk is using the same tactics to impress one of his own kind, they realize that he is doing this all for the She-Hulk. This disturbing turn of events leads Jennifer to realize just how confused the Hulk really is and decides to try one more time to stare him down. This causes the Hulk to think of both Betty and Jarella, the two women he loved most and lost. When the Hulk tries to show off his aggression to She-Hulk, she merely turns her back on him. When the Hulk tries to get her to accept that he is the strongest there is, she flat out rejects him. This rejection makes the Hulk sad, as he doesn't want to be alone anymore. She-Hulk goes to comfort the brute, gently telling him it will never be because they are cousins. She tries to tell him that even though she can never love him in a way that he wants, she still cares. This makes the Hulk angry and he eventually gets fed up and leaps away. When Iron Man tries to follow after him, She-Hulk tells him to leave the Hulk alone, tearfully telling her teammates they should honor the Hulk's most requested demand this one time: leave him alone.\nVarious flashbacks in this story have an impact on the chronology of characters as follows:Page  4:Young Bruce Banner plays with his toy blocks\nPage 10, Panel 1:She-Hulk in court\nPage 10, Panel 2:She-Hulk outside courthouse"

Hellcat tells him he needs Daimon Hellstrom to fight Dormammu; he initially spurns her help but follows her once she reveals she can see the magical traps set for him. She leads him into Hellstrom’s realm, but he is enraged upon seeing her and refuses to help. As Hellstrom and Mephisto argue, Hellcat leaps into the next underworld, that of Pluto. Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch and Hedy arrive at Patsy house to find a large group of assembled heroes, close allies of Hellcat’s who intend to serve as anchors during a séance.\nHellcat emerges from Hela’s realm, apparently having struck some bargain with her too. Then she descends back into the arena of tainted souls, to retrieve Mockingbird who is trapped there [it will turn out that Mockingbird was never dead, so this is the soul of the dead Skrull who replaced her]. She asks after Clint and eventually insists that Hellcat leave her behind, saying she is here for a reason. Dormammu gloats over his apparent conquest of Mephisto’s realm, and relishes reminded Satannish that he is nothing but his minion now.\nThe remaining hell lords summoned by Hellcat convene in Hellstrom’s realm. She convinces them to join hands and conjure a spell which converts the realms of hell into ice rather than fire (since hell is only a state of mind anyway). Since Dormammu is a creature of fire, he is vastly weakened, and is forced to flee with Nicholas Scratch. Mephisto returns through a portal to blast Satannish. Mephisto thanks Hellcat, but then claims her soul anyway. But Patsy lays out what she has learned about the hell lords—that Hellstrom’s father is in fact Satannish, not Satan, and he too, like Satannish, is merely a pawn of Dormammu.\nHellstrom’s head bursts into flame and he acknowledges the truth of this. Then he tries to attack Hellcat and claim her soul, but Mephisto protects her, and even sends her home, where she is surrounded by her friends.\nSeries conclusion."

Xavier realizes Ashley possesses powers of psychokinetic bonding which might be more powerful than even Marvel-Girl’s telekinesis.\nMeanwhile, Stefan Krueger is about to meet with three members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants: Blob, Mastermind and Unus. As those three step on board Krueger’s ship to take over the captured X-Men, Candy Southern has a chance to escape because Krueger did not actually shut her down with his powers (as she is not a mutant). But eventually she falls to the illusion powers of Mastermind. Krueger seems to receive 100,000 dollars for Cyclops, Marvel-Girl and Candy, but the money is just another illusion crafted by Mastermind.\nNear an island of the Savage Land, Havok and Lorna Dane are flying with the Aircar, and according to the Mini-Cerebro on board, getting closer to Iceman. On the island, Magneto has made fabricated a replacement helmet and prepares himself to attack two other humans. He does not know yet that those two are Iceman and Dr. Karl Lykos aka Sauron. Below the island’s surface Magneto discovers a huge geothermal plant and he plans to use the lava at the bottom to his advantage. His attack on Bobby and Karl does not go as planned though. When Bobby wants to help Karl and touches him, Lykos feeds off Bobby’s mutant energies and transforms into Sauron. As the dinosaur attacks Magneto, the X-Men’s Aircar goes haywire and crash-lands close to Iceman. When Bobby sees Lorna, all his memories return instantly, and he helps his fellow X-Men. Together the three watch how Sauron has Magneto caught in his hypnotic gaze. Without a plan Iceman intervenes and breaks up the hypnotic gaze which frees the master of magnetism. Sauron then takes control of Havok to attack Magneto who now resorts to the lava under the island. Lorna deducts that Magneto is powered by an external device. Amphibius has the task to guard that device but Iceman has no problems destroying the equipment anyway. Without his powers Magneto is threatened to be engulfed by the lava. He tries to convince Sauron to help him but Lykos is not interested in any kind of partnership. Iceman wants to save Magneto but is not successful. Before leaving the island, Sauron uses his hypnotic gaze and makes the X-Men forget that they fought him and Magneto on the island.\nThree days later, Magneto can crawl back to the surface of the island.

A priest by the name ofGabriel Rosettihelp the family and performed an exorcism that freed Jason of the demons. But, unbeknownst to them, a Hell-Spawned Warrior called Soulfire lay dormant and awaited the fires of puberty to awaken. One night, after three years of peace, the demon woke and tried to take over Jason. But Jason's will was to strong, and he was able to repress the demon and keep it bottled up within himself. He kept it a secret out of shame, thinking it was proof of his own sinfulness.[1]\nFor four more long years he struggled to contain it, while the demon seethed, its rage and frustration growing beyond comprehension. Until one dayMarglar, a demon who stumbled across an unattended magical chessboard that not onlyHellstormon it but Gabriel Rosetti,Dr. Avram Siegel,Father Jack Riley,Kim Riley,Mariel Riley, and Jason himself among others.[2]\nJason found himself atKennedy Airport, not knowing why he was there, and has Marglar touched Jason's chess-piece unimaginable pain began to shoot through his head and his chess piece's head suddenly was on fire. Which moments before jack, an excommunicated priest who still possessed as one, met his sister and daughter at the same airport. As he went to the lavatory he saw Hellstorm and fearing he was there for him, he cast a spell from his pocket grimoire but accidentally affected his nice Kim.[3]As she became possessed and attacked Hellstorm, she would attack Jack before Hellstorm could free her of the demon. As Hellstorm checked on the Kim, Jason rode in on his bike screaming for help as his whole body was now in flames.[4]\nNow Soulfire, he brutally attacked Hellstorm but he would be thrown into a plane destroying it. But before Soulfire could attack again Marglar had Mariel's chess piece, and with her now possessed struck Hellstorm. Soulfire rejoined the fight and impaled Hellstorm with his ownTrident, but Hellstorm was able to remove it and they continued fighting. Hellstrom, demanding answers as to who Soulfire was, stabbed him with the Trident. Doing so not only restored Jason's memories but allowed him to gain control of Soulfire. Now free, he tried to protect Hellstorm from the possessed Mariel, but not understanding how to use his powers was easily thrown aside and badly wounding him. But with his metaplasmic integument breached and his life in danger Hellstorm rushed to save him. As Jason recovered Hellstorm fought and freed Mariel from her possession, as the police showed up Hellstorm revealed to Jason that they were all pawns in a game played by another. Jason believed it was Hellstrom's father, but Hellstorm told him that what happened today was done by a deranged child and that his father's game will be more considerably more dangerous. Hearing this, Jason told him that the only game he'd rather stick to is Nintendo and they both parted ways.[1]\nSatan found Marglar in his chess room and all the pieces destroyed. Enraged that decades of work were ruined, he sent Marglar to be tortured for the next five millennia, taking the time to think up a newer torment for after, but before that he would first go check on the other game players.[1]\nAfter theCivil War, he was listed as a potential recruit for theInitiative.[5]\nDemonic Form:Jason is possessed by a Hell-Spawned Warrior called Soulfire that has transformed him into large blue skinned demon with a flaming skull, spikes, and claws, and mummy-like wrappings covering parts of his body. Whether or not Jason can return to human form is still unknown, nor are the full extent of the powers Soulfire possesses. So far Soulfire has shown the following powers."

This system designed a small factory and all its contents. That factory system in turn developed a computer and software that designed five generations of more powerful computer platforms. The fifth generation computer achieved an information density double that of the human brain and it could think. The system could do self-directed projects, even write programming while also collating and analyzing data.

Several non-lethal options were later added into the suit's MK II: baton, sabot, and rubber slugs for the cannon, concussion pulses from the hands, and strobes via the unibeam.[4]\nThis model has more plating and shielding than the typical Iron Man armor. A poly-carbonate coating further improves the surface. An additional poly-prismatic coating was temporarily used to counter theLiving Laser's powers. It presumably retained the photon shield from previous armors."

Who then fired on Deathbird, killing her. Ael-Dan concluded that she would not have been able to infiltrate Hala without help, and pointed to the Supreme Intelligence as the culprit. Who revealed it's role only to be killed by a virus activated by Ael-Dan after which he turned on his fellow co-ruler Dar-Ben and kills him. TheAvengersare taken to the concentration camps, except for Captain America who is kept around to witness the destruction of Earth. He ordered the use of the Omni-Wave Annihilator, a weapon that not even the Supreme Intelligence dared use and which generations of Kree refused to use. Cosmic lightning hurtled toward Earth through the sub-space domain and hit the world nearly instantaneously. Within seconds, the planet was consumed by flames billions of degrees hotter than that of a star.\nSoon afterwards, theKreedid the same to theShi'ar Empire, destroying their homeworld.Iron ManandGoliathwere now hunted down as terrorists by the Kree vowing to continue the fight, to save 1000s of other worlds from the same fate. Iron Man created a diversion outside while Goliath infiltrated the prison using Pym particles, and switched places with Captain America. Ronan defeated Iron Man who then seized Ronan, and self-destructs, killing them both. Several days later, with the help of the Kree Underground Resistance, Captain America freed the remaining Avengers from the concentration camp.Sersiand Hercules their lives and took out the camp while giving Captain America, the Black Knight, Cystal, and the Kree rebels time to escape. Kree warships intercepted them, only to be destroyed byQuasarand the Shi'ar dreadnoughts that came out of a warpgate. On board the warships were the remnants of theShi'ar Imperial Guardand the Avengers who had been tasked to go to the Shi'ar throneworld but never made it there. Captain America then vowed that the Kree Empire would go down.[1]\nSeveral years after the Kree's victory over the Shi'ar and the destruction of Earth, the Kree dominated six sectors of space. Any resistance they encountered was brutally crushed. It was a genocidal fascist empire that had exterminated 1000s of \"genetically unfit\" races and 1000s more faced extinction, and in their prison camps were those who opposed their rule including both theSkrullsand rebellious Kree. Galaxies squirmed and pleaded for mercy under the boot of Kree oppression. Ruling the empire was the mad emperor, Ael-Dan. Keeping what little hope remained alive where a band of rumored and rarely seen heroes, freedom fighters made up of survivors of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard and the Avengers. Within the Kree Empire, even the Kree are oppressed by Ael-Dan's regime, overseen by \"Morale Officers\". Citizens are often forced to go without food, as the resources of the empire are devoted to the ever growing military-industrial complex.\nThe freedom fighters infiltrated a remote lunar Kree base, and stole billions of gigabytes of data, though at the cost of Smasher who gave his life to cover their escape and of the Black Knight who died from his wounds en route back to the Avengers' secret base. In addition Vision was gone, as the data storage units they stole were too badly damaged, therefore he volunteered to have the data overwrite his mind. Using the stolen data, a fleet of warships made up of the remnants of the once mighty fleets of those races that had been conquered by the Kree headed toward Hala in a desperate attempt to overthrow the Kree regime. Leading them were the Avengers and assisting them were Fifth columnists within the Kree military. Greatly outnumbered it appears the fleet would be destroyed when out of a warp gate \"Space Patrol\" emerged, a force of superhumans led by Quasar (and including the Silver Surfer, Firelord, Nova, the Super Skrull, and others) and joined battle against the Kree fleet. Another team of Avengers infiltrated Kree airspace via a small dropship from which they bailed out of before it crashed into the Citadel of Judgement. Thor in turn led an Asgardian force into Hala via a portal, joining the battle."

In mid 2099, the Martyrs hacked into a fiberoptic trunkline and snagged a heavily-encrypted data archive of unknown origin. While they were attempting to decrypt the file, the Martyrs were attacked by a gang known as theArtificial Kidz, who proceeded to murder most of the Martyrs and set off in pursuit of Zero and the archive. With the poison from the flechette round he took while fleeing the Kidz rapidly eating away at his nervous system, Zero makes a last-ditch effort to screw them over by transferring the encrypted file to his girlfriend and then jacking directly into cyberspace in an attempt to burn out his headware implants.\nShortly after his white-hot fade into oblivion, Zero awoke to find himself in a surrealistic cyberscape populated by a group of rogue machine intelligences who call their realm The Ghostworks. TheseAIsbelieved that the current human society (your typical \"Corporations Own Everything\" cyberpunk dystopia) was heading for a total collapse. And, being completely dependent on the world's technological infrastructure for survival, they wished to send Zero back to the real world to serve as their agent of change. Appealing to his anarchist sensibilities, the Ghostworks couched the whole deal as a chance for him to get back at The System and all those authority figures who seemed bound and determined to make life miserable for \"the little guy.\" Zero, of course, accepted - though whether this was really of his own free will or due to subtle modifications the AIs made to his personality construct is debatable.\nThe machines hijacked an automated factory and constructed a heavily modified variant of a Cybertek 101 warbot, laden with advanced nanotech weaponry, self-repair, and camouflage capabilities, and downloaded their copy of Zero's personality into its neuro-net. Before hitting the streets, Zero used the robot's holographic capabilities to wreath his skull-like head in artificial flame - an homage to his fallen comrades that also served to make him look very similar to theGhost Ridersof the previous centuries. Appropriately enough, his first course of action was to seek vengeance against those responsible for their deaths. His quest eventually lead back to theD/Monix corporation(the legal owners of the archive) and his father,Harrison Cochrane.[1]\nDuring the course of his investigation into the missing file, Harrison realized that, as the hackers had used his own access codes to intercept the data transmission, the only suspect could be his son, Kenshiro. Feeling more loyalty to the corporation than to his gutter-trash son, it was a simple matter for Harrison to hire the Artificial Kidz to wipe out the Hotwire Martyrs and retrieve the archive. Upon beating this information out of his father, Ghost Rider prepared to kill the old man, but was distracted when he learned that D/Monix was currently torturing his former girlfriend,Kylie Gagarin, in an attempt to find out where she stashed the copy of the archive he had sent her before his \"death.\"[citation needed]\nWhile hunting down the component chemicals for the drug he needs to save Kylie's life, Ghost Rider headed to anAlchemaxfacility inNueva York- where he ran afoul of contemporary incarnation ofSpider-Man. They battled, but GR got away with the chemical in time. With the drug synthesized, he volunteered to go into Kylie's head to bring her out of her coma, which began a phantasmagorical journey into her psyche that gave insight into both Kylie's past and provided a few glimpses into what Zero was like when he was alive. Of course, he didn't much care for the version of himself that he saw and, after Kylie woke up, Ghost Rider tried to convince her that Zero was dead and that she was better off without him. Of course, the way he said it lead her to realize that GR was Zero and, thus, had the exact opposite effect of making her more curious about him.[citation needed]\nAfter discovering that his personality construct had been modified to prevent him from mentioning certain topics of discussion (namely the Ghostworks and things related to them), Ghost Rider dove into cyberspace in an attempt to track the Works down and hammer out some answers. The AIs hid from him and some discussed the possibility that they may have made a mistake when they chose Zero as their agent. Others suggested they wait it out - citing that the Ghost Rider would soon be much too busy to bother them. The prophecy came true, of course, as he was launched into a series of battles pitting him against a heavily-cyberedJeter(the man who killed him), a thrill-kill club that has been using monstrous-looking constructs to hunt down former special-forces types for sport, and a highly-skilled cybernetic assassin namedCoda- who actually managed to blast GR into his constituent components.[citation needed]\nA short time later, Ghost Rider revived to discover that theDoomof 2099 had managed to take control of the United States. Having earlier made a deal with the Ghostworks for access to their agent (in exchange for leaving them be), Doom sent hisSHIELDagents out into the city to track the rogue android down. GR was hauled before the President and presented with an offer to become the Federal Marshal for the Transverse City region. Though he initially refused (not wanting to become part of the System he so despised), Doom triggered a series of override commands and forced Zero to accept the position.[citation needed]"

He enters and instantly notices a young girl being read to by her mother. On the television is another report about the death of Ricky Myers. Bruce's view of the television is blocked by Wanda, the owner restaurant who wants to take his order. After placing his order, Bruce waves at the little girl who stares at him blankly. He then notices that her mother has books on Autism. Seeing how the mother struggles with her daughter makes Bruce feel sad. He then pulls out his laptop and logs onto the internet. He contacts the mysterious Mr. Blue and asks for a weather report. As a nondescript black call pull up in front of the diner, Mr. Blue responds warning him that there is a \"possible storm\" headed his way. Out of the car comes three men dressed in black and wearing ear pieces.\nAs the newcomers sit down and order coffees, Bruce makes his way to the restroom just as the news reports shows a picture of Banner. Realizing that the man sitting at the booth is the person they are looking for, the men spot Bruce heading to the washroom. When they discover that the door is locked, one of the men kicks it in while his two colleagues go around to the back of the building. They discover that Banner is nowhere to be seen and the bathroom window is broken. Thinking Bruce had escaped the diner, the men begin looking around. However, Banner was hiding in a storage closet and slips out the front door. He then crosses the street into a nearby field. Thinking he got away, Bruce is shocked when he is struck with a tranquilizer dart and passes out. He briefly regains consciousness in the back seat of the car of the men who captured him. He then passes out again and dreams. In his dream he sees the autistic girl and a scruffy dog that was hanging around the diner. When they see Bruce they run away, and Bruce follows after them. At the clearing, he finds himself at a beach. The only person there is his late wife, Betty Ross, in a bikini. Betty holds up a metronome and smiles and then suddenly turns back into the little girl. When a strange worm-like creature washes ashore, the pair push it back out in the water.\nBruce suddenly wakes up and transforms into the Hulk, who tries to smash his way out of the car causing it to crash. With his captors knocked out, the Hulk reverts back to Bruce Banner who takes one of their outfits. He returns to the diner just as the autistic girl and her mother are leaving. As they leave, they drop one of their books on autism. Bruce bends down to pick it up and hands it back to the girl's mother. As they walk out of the store, the little girl turns around smiles at Bruce and he smiles back. Later, one his way out, Bruce gives a bag of french fries to the dog sitting outside and goes back out to the road to thumb for another ride."

Unit Eleven, Aliya's sisterHope, father and sonAdamandJon Spectre,Dawnsilk,Lark,Sepulcher, andSilo. Nathan became the foremost military leader of the New Canaanites opposition and continued the ways of the Askani.[2][3]\nTraining in the Askani ways under surviving Askani elders, the Clan Chosen repeatedly battled the New Canaanites and the Scions of the High Lord, led by Stryfe. The Clan Chosen also clashed with the Neo-Canaanites, a group that also wished to claim Apocalypse's power. Around Nathan's sixteenth birthday, one of the Canaanite forces had been infecting members of the Clan Chosen with nanite explosives, turning them into unwilling suicide bombers. Nathan and a squad attacked theSiberianFacility, where the nanites were controlled, and learned that one of his clan was infected. Nathan attempted to destroy their ability to trigger the bombs, by destroying the facility, but the clan member was still active. Fearing for his life, the clan member ran to his teammates, but Nathan, attempting to save the remaining lives of the squad, was forced to detonate the nanite.[4]\nWhen Stryfe's spy,Korless, infiltrated the Clan and Stryfe psychically attacked Nathan, Stryfe captured Tetherblood and the Professor from Nathan's camp and Stryfe tortured Tetherblood to find out its importance. The withdraw of the Professor from Nathan caused him to become very sick and Blaquesmith sent Aliya to the past to find Cable, the adult Nathan. Aliya was successful, though she and Nathan were unaware of Cable's true origin. Cable returned with the Professor's A.I., which again merged with Nathan.[5]\nNathan fell in love with Aliya and the two married. Aliya took the clan name of 'Jenskot' as a tribute to Jean and Scott, the parents of the Askani'son. Later, Jenskot was captured, during a New Canaanite raid and, while she did not speak of her time as a prisoner, it was hinted that she was tortured and raped by Stryfe. Eventually, Nate was able to rescue her. Jenskot later gave birth to her son,Tyler Dayspring, and Nathan never questioned his parentage. Tyler later came to join his father’s band of freedom fighters and, during a later attack by Stryfe's forces, a bomb was set and Aliya was fatally wounded. Aliya died in Nathan's arms and asked him to take care of her son, unaware that Tyler had been abducted. Stryfe ordered Parridan Haight's mind-warper,Frisco, to brainwash Tyler to reject Nathan’s beliefs and become Stryfe’s pawn.[6]\nWhen the Clan Chosen attacked Stryfe, Tyler captured Dawnsilk, forging a neural link between them to gain Clan Chosen secrets. Nathan decided to sever the link, by shooting his son, in order to save Dawnsilk. This knocked Tyler out and further damaged his and Dawnsilk's mind as well. During another battle, Nathan and Tetherbood lead a squad to obtainCaptain America's Shield, which Nathan used to inspire liberty and justice in his followers. After the Neo-Canaanites defeated the New Canannites, Nathan learned that Stryfe used theTinexand, with theA.D.A.M. Unit Zero, fled, traveling back in time to the late 20th century. As part of his mission as the Askani'son, Nathan returned to the 20th century to foil the plans of Stryfe and preserve Apocalypse's rise to power. Nathan, now calling himself Cable, shuttled between the past and future multiple times.[2][7]"

They would reject him, sending the hero off to try and prove himself as a superior hero.\nOnEarth-772, events would happen differently as the sympatheticInvisible Girlwould convince him to stay and learningSpider-Man'sfinancial plights would agree to let him join their group renaming themselves theFantastic Five.\nEvents would happen differently that would have major impacts on the the FF and Spider-Man's histories. When the Fantastic Five would announce Spider-Man's membership into the groupJ. Jonah Jamesonwould be forced to back down from his budding campaign of editorials demonizing Spider-Man. The news would convince theChameleonto give up his plot to steal defense plans for the Russians. The group would also easily defeatthe Vulturequashing his criminal career before it could begin.\nWhen going to explore the Blue Area of the Moon, the Fantastic Five would leave Sue behind to monitor their adventure as they had not yet modifiedReed'srocket to seat five people. As her comrades battledRed Ghostand hisSuper-Apes, aPuppet MastercontrolledNamorwould hypnotize Sue into coming with him to Atlantis. Returning from the Moon victorious the FF would learn of Sue's disappearance and go to her rescue. However by then Sue would have regained control of her mind and decide to stay with Namor and be his bride subjecting herself to a process that would allow her to breath underwater.\nEventually Reed would become consumed with jealousy over Namor and Sue's romance and it would effect the now Fantastic Four to the point where the group would split up. Reed, along with Johnny would try to get the United Nations to attack Atlantis however this ruse would be exposed by the thing. This would prompt Johnny and Reed into attacking Atlantis on their own. Attempting to slay every Atlantean, Reed would soon give up his quest when he realized that Sue was pregnant with Namor's childLeonard McKenziegiving up his vendetta and leaving Atlantis. Johnny would not be so easily swayed and would leave vowing to get revenge.\nThis would not come to pass, as for reasons unrevealed Sue would return to the surface, her ability to breath under water reversed. The Fantastic Five would reunite and Reed and Sue would be married and Sue would become pregnant with Reed's child. However due to her mutated nature the pregnancy would be complicated, and would send the remaining members of the Fantastic Five into theNegative Zoneto getAnnihilus'scosmic control rod. They would find opposition fromDr. Doomwhom was being manipulated by theTime-Twistersto killFranklin Richards, Earth-772's Nexus Being, by convincing Doom that the Cosmic Control Rod could free his mother from the grasps of Mephisto. However the truth would be revealed to Doom by theWhispererand he would aid the Fantastic Five in saving Sue's life. Doom would seemingly perish however he would be pulled out of time by Immortus who would use him and a team of other alternate reality heroes to stop the Time-Twisters from succeeding in their plot. Ultimately, they would succeed and Doom would be returned to his native Earth-772.\nEarth-772 may also have other differences prior to the formation of the Fantastic Five, such as its Thor having red hair.[1]"

When theKreefelt threatened by the rise ofEarth, they used an unknown means of devastating the planet, which flooded the water after the polar ice caps melted and the atmosphere was rendered toxic for decades.[1]Mister FantasticandDoctor Doomworked together to find a solution, but they were killed by Kree assassins.[2]\nEvery superpowered being went into space to fight the Kree, but they never returned. Themutantsof Earth decided to simply leave the planet altogether. The handful of humans that survived were rendered sterile. The chaos brought by the Kree allowed theAtlanteansunite and thrive, andNamorbecame the planet's ruler.\nNamor showed mercy to thehumansthat survived by building underwater colonies for them to live in. Some humans chose to live in the colonies, but many chose not to due to distrust in the Altanteans. Namor eventually stepped down as king and made his cousinNamoritahis successor. One day, Namor visited one of the underwater human colonies calledDry Man's Landby the inhabitants.Captain Americavoiced the problems Dry Man's Land had due to neglect. Namor promised to do something. Namor then accompanied Rogers toNew York Cityto see the birth of the first human child in two years. Unfortunately, none of New York's citizens approved of Namor's appearance, especiallyLuke Cage. He punched Namor and revealed that the baby and its mother had died. A fight then broke out between the citizens and Namor's guards, which Namor and Rogers tried desperately to stop. After Namor was struck by a human attacker, he was surprised by the arrival of theHuman Torch.[1]\nNamor tried flying after the Torch, but he couldn't sustain flight due to his age. Atlantean scientistEudorainformed Namor that the Torch's pyrokinetic power could be used to solve the energy woes of Atlantis' human colonies. Rogers couldn't accompany Namor due to his commitments toward Dry Man's Land. So, Cage accompanied Namor instead. The pair traveled to the ruins of theBaxter Buildingto obtain information on the Torch. While they waited, they were attacked by a crazedMachine Man. After Namor and Cage fought him off, Machine Man warned them that the Torch was raising a robot army to wage war on both humans and Atlanteans and left. After stepping outside, Namor was informed by Eudora that she tracked the Torch's location at the remains ofLatveria.[3]\nWhen Namor and Cage arrived, they discovered that a group of humans survivors living in the ruins ofCastle Doomand were able to reproduce. The pair then discovered thatFrankenstein's Monsterprotected the survivors usingDoombotsand weapons left behind by Doctor Doom, though the weapons were later stolen by the Torch. The Monster tried to have the Doombots kill Namor and Cage from the misplaced belief that Namor wanted to kill the humans. When Namor learned that the Monster also killed any Atlanteans that got too close to Latveria, he became enraged and fought the Monster. The fight was halted when Namor rescued a human child, which let the Monster know that Namor meant no harm. As the two sides conversed, the Torch suddenly appeared.[2]\nTo prove he wasn't a threat, the Torch took Namor, Cage, and the Monster to his hidden colony of robots living peacefully from the outside world. Later, Namor and the Torch received a message from Rogers that he had Machine Man with him. Machine Man then destroyedDry Man's Landafter stating that he did it in the Torch's name. Dry Man's Land's inhabitants died, including Rogers. Namor accused the Torch of the attack. The Torch pleaded his innocence, but he refused to back down. Namor eventually impaled the Torch with hisTrident of Neptune.[4]"

Led byMagneto, an army of mutants launched a global attack against humankind. Stark took advantage of the situation, funding Magneto's army in order to thin out the planet's superhuman population through the resulting war. While Magneto had promised Stark leadership of Earth's remaining humans after the war, Stark betrayed him and killed Magneto, becoming a worldwide hero.[1]\nNext, Stark engineered a famine that caused millions of deaths worldwide. After curing this famine, Stark's fame grew further and he soon won the presidency of theUnited States of America. He next developed technology that allowed him to control the climate, using it to bring about massive natural disasters inEuropeandAsia, to prompt those countries affected to relinquish control to him. Economic downspins in the Americas had the same effect, soon uniting the planet under Stark's rule.[1]\nDoctor Doomwas soon the only challenge left to Stark's authority. Despite the two having a secret alliance, Doom betrayed Stark and attempted to seize power for himself. While Stark succeeded in killing him, Doom managed to disfigure Stark. With his enemies destroyed, Stark turned his gaze towardsInhumans, hoping to seize their technology to use them as fodder in his armies. Led byKing Black BoltandQueen Susan Storm, the Inhumans did their best to remain hidden.[2]"

However, her other child,Franklinpredicts that the child is a monster, but no one believes him.\nDuring the course of her pregnancy, Sue's physical condition worsened daily and took a horrible toll on her. She became weaker and weaker and almost becomes skeletal, losing her invisibility powers. When she gives birth to her child, Sue died in the process. The baby turns out to be a monster, who had possessed its body as Franklin predicted, a succubus (from theNegative Zone) who drained the life energy of others. In fact, she drained Susan's life while she was still an unborn baby in her mother's womb.\nReednamed the babySuzyin order to deal with the loss of his wife. As the years go by, Susan slowly killed more and more people, and eventually, Ben also fell victim to her. Since he was mutated by cosmic radiation, the drain on him took longer, and it finally manifested when he lost his powers, which he actually considers a blessing since he was now human again."

The Sorcerer grew in importance, and eventually received the Ka Stone from a young woman who found it in the desert. Having acquired eternal life and great power, the sorcerer became the Sphinx. He married and eternalized the young woman. Together, they advised hundreds of pharaohs, guided the discovery of new continents, watched the Declaration of Independence and the creation of the United States of Assyria, the civil war that ended the Caucasian slavery; overall, they helped guide civilization.[1]\nThen, in the early 20th century, World War I made Europe a bloody battlefield, and the USA had to interfere. The Sphinx and wife moved to the USA, but the period between wars was equally unstable. Another Great War came, this time between the Anglo-Saxons, Egyptians and Assyrians allied against the Asian-Pacific Union. The Asians dropped A-bombs over New Memphis, and destroyed Aknatonikutt and New Hebridas; Maqaman Island survived because of its force field. Exhausted, the Sphinx gave his wife's cat immortality, and gave her the Ka Stone, allowing himself to die at last.[1]\nCannonball, Firestar and Marvel Man, this reality's Vance Astrovik, part of a group of mutant rebels, were intercepted by this Earth's Avengers while they tried to bring secret information regarding the force field around Maqaman Island, the Sphinx's lair. In the ensuing fight, Commander Logan distracted the Avengers long enough for the three to be saved, but was killed by Horus in the process. The three returned safely to their HQ in New Hebridas. Returning to his family home, the Avenger Nova found Sayge, who revealed him the Earth's true history.[2]\nA group of the Mutant Liberation Front - including Juggernaut, Cannonball, Marvel Man, Firestar, Beast and Sebastian Shaw - invaded Maqaman Island, having deactivated its force field using information provided by Sgt. Fury and Reed Richards. Meanwhile, fully informed of his Earth's inherent falsehood, Richard Rider left his home to help the Avengers battle the invading mutants. More and more his mind began to turn to the truth (Earth-616), and he switched sides. He knocked out the Avengers, and as the whole MLF invaded the island, a towering Sphinx appeared, ready to destroy the MLF and Earth altogether. Meanwhile, the Richard and the Taylors, humans trying to betray the Sphinx, were killed at the Taylor home. Only young Dwayne survived, ready for revenge.[3]\nAs the battle between the Sphinx and the MLF raged on, Dwayne Taylor infiltrated the Sphinx home at the Chrysler Building where, now as Night Thrasher, Dwayne saw his world plunging into chaos. Dwayne saw the Sphinx's cat, the last memory of his love of her, and decided to slay it. The Sphinx was distracted when she sensed it, and fled the scene. The MLF started to battle the assembled Avengers, and the members of Earth-616 New Warriors, aided by Sayge (sans Namorita, who was helping an invasion of the Persian Gulf with his cousin, and Speedball, who was just a powerless kid in Springdale, Aknatonikutt), went to the Chrysler building, where they helped Night Thrasher. Richard Rider captured the cat, and threatened to kill it if the Sphinx, whom Sayge revealed the Truth to, didn't alter the world back to its real state. Wanting to save her last token of her lost love, the Sphinx reverted her alteration of the Earth, returning all to normal.[4]"

Developing a suit of armor that rendered him invisible to Uatu's gaze and procuring the androidDragon Man, Aron sought to obtain the DNA samples of the Fantastic Four.[3]With the help of theFrightful Four, Aron succeeded in his task. He then createdclonesof the existing members of the Fantastic Four,Mister Fantastic, theInvisible Woman, theHuman Torch, the Thing, andMs. Marvel.[4]\nWith the real Fantastic Four put in suspended animation so he could watch their dreams, Aron sent the clones out into the world to take their place. Their first order of business was to recreate the first battle against the Fantastic Four's oldest foe, theMole Man. Raising the previously sunkenMonster Islefrom the ocean floor, the cloned Fantastic Four attacked the Mole Man and his minions. After defeating their foes, the clones fled the island after setting off a massive explosion.[5]Seeking to recreate the Fantastic Four's encounter with theMiracle Man, the clones later attacked an innocent magician during a stage performance and exposed how he performed his magic tricks to an increasingly hostile crowd. Feeling under appreciated for their \"efforts\", the clone of Mister Fantastic suggested that they begin charging a \"Fantasti-Tax\" in order to pay for their services.[6]\nEventually the activities of the clones attracted the attention of theAvengersandDoctor Strangewho came to believe that some outside force had changed the real Fantastic Four's personalities. However before the fight could get out of hand, the clones all found themselves teleported back to Aron's hideout in the Rocky Mountains. There they discovered that the Fantastic Four and Frightful Four had broken free and were battling it out, while Aron himself was trapped in suspended animation. The Fantastic Four and their clones battled it out with one another until the real Fantastic Four defeated them. Freeing himself from suspended animation, Aron came to the conclusion that experiencing the dreams of others was more fascinating than their real life exploits, he sent the Frightful Four to theVault, the real Fantastic Four home, and spirited off to manipulate the dreams of his clones.[7]"

Together withReed-12498andReed-99107, they founded theInterdimensional Council of Reeds.[2]\nDoom ruling as god and then being overthrown\nThe Council of Reeds was annihilated by theMad Celestials.[3]Following this,Doctor DoomofEarth-616found the corpses of Reed-98570 and Reed-99107, both of whom still had their Infinity Gauntlets.[4]After stealing both Gauntlets, he was called to the Bridge that led to Earth-98570, the native universe where one of the Gauntlets worked. In this vacant universe, he created life of magic and of science. There was only one planet that mattered, containing Doomopolis. However, on the seventh day, he realized that he made this universe in his own image and his own creations turned on him. HisInfinity Gemswere split among the three High Priests of Science and the three Professors of Magic.[1]"

When the group agreed to allow Spider-Man into the group, Ben was initially resentful of Spider-Man due to the fact that Ben didn't believe that they needed another person with advanced strength. However, Ben soon came to appreciate Spider-Man's assistance.\nBen Grimm\nBen aided the newly formed Fantastic Five in stopping theVulture, quashing his criminal career in its infancy. When theHuman Torchburned away the Vulture's wings, the Thing grabbed him, preventing a fatal fall. WhenMr. Fantasticwished to win the space-race by piloting a rocket to the moon, Ben accompanied him with the Torch and Spider-Man, leaving theInvisible Girlbehind. Ben battled theRed Ghostand hisSuper-Apesand met theWatcher. Returning to Earth, they found that Sue had been captured by theSub-Marinerwho was then under the control ofPuppet Master. Ben was a major contributer in the fight, battling the giant octopus that was holding Sue captive. Ben and the others were shocked when Sue decided to stay with Namor and have herself converted into a water-breather, before the rest departedAtlantis.[1]\nBen continued heroing with Reed, Johnny, and Spider-Man facing such threats as theMad Thinker, andDr. Doom. During their battle against theSuper-Skrull, the group got into an argument with Spider-Man over his lack of teamwork, prompting the wall-crawler to quit the team. Later, the Thing's opinions on Reed's \"cowardice\" for letting Namor win Sue over caused more infighting among the group. Namor came to invite them to the coming birth of his and Sue's son, leading to Reed lashing out at him and sending him away. Reed then began an obsessive campaign to convince the world's governments to attack Atlantis, doctoring footage to make the undersea nation look like a dire threat. Disliking this manipulation, Ben revealed to the gathered United Nations that Reed had doctored the footage, and showed how Reed personally instigated hostility with the Sub-Mariner, ruining Reed's credibility. Reed and Johnny  abandoned Ben to pursue their own war against Atlantis, one which ultimately failed.[2]\nSometime later, through unrevealed circumstances, the Fantastic Five reunited and Reed and Sue rekindled their relationship. Sue became pregnant with Reed's first child, but required the radiations fromAnnihilus'Cosmic Control Rodto allow her to survive the birth. The Thing joined Reed, Johnny, and Spider-Man into theNegative Zoneto collect the Cosmic Control Rod. When the group secured it from Annihilus, they attempted to escape the Zone only to be attacked by Dr. Doom who took the Rod from them. When the FF reclaimed the Rod and returned to the positive matter universe, the Rod aided in the deliveryy and Sue gave birth to her child. The Thing's subsequent activities following the birth remain unrevealed.[3]\nAfterwards, Ben and the rest of the Fantastic Five engagedKarnin a fight when he attempted to murder their Spider-Man during his hunt to kill all Spiders across the multiverse. Despite the team's best efforts, all were killed in the struggle.[4]"

In a bid win the space race, Reed,Susan Storm, andJohnny Stormconvinced Ben to participate in an an unauthorized launch of a space-shuttle. The others ignored Ben Grimm in regards to the dangers of cosmic rays and the ship's untested shielding, and convinced him to pilot the shuttle. The shuttle crashed, but not before the group were exposed to a sizeable dose of cosmic radiation, causing all of them to mutate. Together they formed the superhero group known as theFantastic Fourand would go on to have countless adventures.[1]\nIn time, Reed and Susan were married and had a son by the name ofFranklin, who grew up to join the Fantastic Four on their adventures. After the mysterious mutation of all mankind, which Reed believed he was responsible for, complete anarchy gripped the world, as people found themselves deformed and superpowered over night. Ben was one of many heroes who attempted to help people through this time of chaos.[2]\nThe Fantastic Four would meet a grim end as their final mission brought them to theUnited NationswhereNamor the SubmarinerandDoctor Doomwere attacking the delegates. The mutation of humanity had led to a shortage of food, causing mankind to turn towards the seas for sustenance. This angered Namor, and whenAtlantiswas refused a seat at the UN meeting discussing the crisis, Doom seized the opportunity to recruit him for his scheme.[1]\nThe Fantastic Four andCaptain Americaarrived to stop their attack. During the battle theHuman Torch's neck was broken by Namor causing Franklin to curse the Sub-Mariner to burn forever, making the monarch flee back into the ocean. Meanwhile, Dr. Doom and the Invisible Woman would be killed in an explosion when Doom's plot to murder Reed Richards went awry.[1]\nThis marked the end of the Fantastic Four, over the years Ben Grimm would marry his long time girlfriendAlicia Masters(who had mutated to have the ability to bring life to the lifeless), they would own a house onYancy Street(storing most of Reed's inventions there) and have two children,BuzzandChuck, presumably using Alicia's newfound powers to allow them to procreate. They would live a humble existence.[1]\nSome years later, they would be visited byAdam WarlockandHer, who sought to birth a child. Alicia would help them in this matter unaware that the child that Her would bear would be the reincarnation of theKreesoldierMar-Vell. Shortly after, the Grimm's were visited by theInhuman Royal Familywho had come seeking Reed Richards to help in finding their lost nation on Earth. Ben would invite them in for dinner and tell them of the changes that had happened on Earth since their departure, including the last adventure of the Fantastic Four.[1]\nBen would be visited by Reed himself shortly thereafter, seeking diagrams ofCharles Xavier's brain patterns in order to mimic them so that he could useCerebroto track theInhuman nation. Ben was present when Reed used Cerebro to determine that everyone on Earth had in fact been mutated by the Terrigen Mists.[3]\nBen would later be recruited by Captain America to be part of an army of heroes from all over the world to stop theSkullfrom enslaving the world. Eventually with the help of Alicia's clayMarvelsthe Skull was defeated. Their triumph did not last long however, as the Final Host ofCelestialsarrived to purge the Earth of live in order to protect their embryo growing in Earth's core. The world was saved however by the arrival ofGalactus, who was in fact Reed's son Franklin. Having forgotten his true identity, Galactus was convinced to spare Earth and destroy the embryo. After the lighting a series of Human Torches that would burn the Terrigen Mists out of the Earth's atmosphere, Ben Grimm and his family would return toCastle DoominLatveriawith Reed Richards.[4][5]\nIn Latveria, the Thing would help Reed, as well as witness the rebirth of Mar-Vell through Her, and try to stop an army of invading mutated humans from kidnapping her. Some three years later, after noticeable weather changes due to the planet's repolarization following the death of the Celestial embryo, the Thing was asked to retrieve the now three years old Mar-Vell from his hiding place in Atlantis. Despite his best efforts to control himself, Ben could not contain his anger at coming face to face with Johnny Storm's killer. After a brief scuffle with Namor, the Thing succeeded in bringing Mar-Vell back. Thing would then witness Mar-Vell bringing Susan Richards back to life using a combination of one of Reed's arms, Alicia's sculpting abilities, and Adam Warlock'sSoul Gem.[6]\nFollowing the death of Captain America, Ben and Alicia were asked to go toMount Rushmoreand carve the Captain's face onto the mountain, to pay homage to the hero and what he stood for.[7][8]\nFollowing the final outcome of Mar-Vell's quest to killDeath, people were now unable to die, no matter what had happened to them. The Human Torches would then be taken down and converted into hospitals. Ben would remain at the hospital located in Latveria, where he would help Reed around in his lab.[9]\nWhen it was decided by the world's smartest minds that a new death would have to be created, Ben remembered an adventure he had with Captain America where he had met a creature namedJude the Entropic Man. Hoping to revive Jude and synthesize his ability to cast entropy, Thing would lead the group to where Jude's inert form lay dormant in theFloridaEverglades. The group succeeded in capturing Jude, and Reed managed to synthesize his abilities into a serum capable of delivering death to those who desired it.[10]\nWhenAnnihilusandBlastaarcame to Earth because they blamed Reed Richards for the anti-matter star in their universe sudden expansion, Reed realized that it was really Mar-Vell's newly built \"Paradise\" which was the cause. Thing would be one of the many heroes that would accompany Reed into theNegative Zonewho would act as back-up in case Reed's attempt to contact Mar-Vell failed.[11]"

Eight years after she discovered she was a mutant, another mutant was discovered among the Atlanteans, namedAttuma. Who believed that the gods gave him a mandate to seize the Atlantean throne fromQueen Dorma. Namora arrived too late to save the queen and avenged her death by killing Attuma. Since Attuma had killed all those who could succeed Dorma, the people clamored for her to assume the throne of Atlantis to which she agreed.\nBecause she forbade contact with the surface world, for decades Atlantis experienced peace. Two world wars and nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean convinced the Atlanteans that the surface dwellers posed a threat to all. Namora decided to launch a preemptive strike on the surface world, only to be contacted byProfessor Xavierand she agreed to delay her invasion and listen to what he had to say. Xavier became one of Namora's few personal friends. Because of Magneto's attack on an air force base, fear of mutants grew. Despite Namora's consul to fight back, Xavier and the X-Men peacefully surrendered and were imprisoned. Any mutant who refused to surrender were hunted down by the armed forces and government-sanction heroes like the Avengers. The only superhero who spoke against what was happening was Reed Richards."

Superioribus apparently lives inBarcelona,Spain,[8][23][24]but covered the distance toOld Yorkwithout any transport except his own flying capabilities in a very short time,[12]and was also known to have visitedJapan.[25]SeveralAmericanandCanadiansuper heroes frequently meet each other, and with Superioribus, without an apparent reason to travel to another country.[24]\nIn 1987,Antonio Martínwas the chief editor (\"director editorial\") ofComics Forum, a Spanish publishing company belonging toPlaneta DeAgostinithat had the rights to publishMarvel Comicsmaterial.[26][27]As later reported byLorenzo F. Díaz, at that point Martín wanted to include a Spanish product to complement the American productions,[26]and contacted reputed Spanish artistJan,[27]whom Martín had already edited in the early 1970s.[27]Jan was already famous because of his super hero parodySuperlópez(sometimes styled Super López), created in 1973 and published byEditorial Bruguerafrom 1975 to Bruguera's crisis and bankruptcy in 1982; Grupo Z'sEdiciones Beventually acquired that material and continued working with Jan and Superlópez, but at that point many Bruguera artists were in transition jobs.[28]Jan had just started working with Ediciones B, yet he agreed to simultaneously work in Martín's project, creating a super hero for him.[27]\nScene from the 1984 unpublished story introducing Superioribus.\nBack in 1984,[26]Jan had created \"Emeterio González\" as a character for a few unpublished pages called either \"Origins\" or \"Superioribus\".[26][29]Jan made use of these pages as conceptual sketches for the new character.[29]\nWanting to establish a clear difference with Superlópez, Jan decided that Superioribus would be made of one-page gag stories, in black and white, and usingtramas, as an explicit homage to artistWill Eisner'sThe Spirit[26][29]- to the point of including The Spirit's Commissioner Dolan asa characterin the first Superioribus story.[2]\nSuperioribus was first introduced in a comical Christmas card to the readers in the back ofLos Nuevos Vengadores, Especial Navidad 1987(and further \"Christmas specials\" that same year),[30][28]then the character was introduced with two one-page stories inLa Patrulla-X#60(translatingUncanny X-Men#209).[30][2]Superioribus' stories appeared in the inner side of the back cover of Forum'sLa Patrulla-XandLos Nuevos Vengadores(translatingWest Coast AvengersVol. 2),[26][27][29]in stories where Superioribus sometimes interact with Marvel characters. This continued through 1988 and 1989.[26]\n1999 compilation, cover."

However, instead of finding Reed there he instead found in his place a vial carrying theVenom symbiote. Ben was intrigued by the creature's seeming life with Reed explaining that they were experimenting on the creature to see whether or not it was alive. Ben then confronted Reed on him not being there to celebrate their anniversary and Reed stated he wanted to give Ben time to adjust after having gotten back from space. However Ben believed Reed to be making excuses of his guilt for how Ben became the Thing. Before the two could further argue,Invisible Womancalled Reed over.\nBen then felt hurt and believed that Reed didn't truly understand him, however the symbiote then began to get Ben's attention. The symbiote asked Ben to free it and while hesitant, Ben decided to go through with it with the symbiote possessing him. When Reed came back, he found to his horror the symbiote possessing Ben. However, to Ben's amazement, the symbiote turned him back to human form. Ben was happy; however, Reed tried to persuade Ben that this wasn't the right thing to do things. Ben mistook Reed's concern for jealousy and broke the sonic machine when Reed attempted to use it before jumping out the window. While on the street, Ben back in his human form complimented himself and flirted with some ladies when he met withThe Lizardwho despite Connors' pleas that he had no intentions of fighting Ben, Ben suited up and fought the Lizard."

It was a struggle against time as one of them would remain human and the other would remain the Thing. Wanting to maintain his humanity, Grimm the Sorcerer sought to destroy his better half.[3]\nGrimm the Sorcerer, unmasked.[6]\nShortly after Ben Grimm began travelling with the female warrior namedTarianna,[7]the Sorcerer began making his presence known. He caused Ben to be captured by theThings, creatures that resembled Ben's Thing form, so that he could capture Tarianna.[8]Then using his mystical powers to make Tarianna look like a male warriors called the Recknoner. He succeeded in tricking the Thing into beating Tarianna into unconsciousness.[9]Although this did nothing to break up the union between the Thing and Tarianna. The Sorcerer later attempted to prevent the infant king ofMuabreach his home. Ben and Tarianna rescued the child, whom they namedJuneyarand foiled the Sorcerer's plot, getting the child to his kingdom, but not before Tarianna was captured again.[10]As the Sorcerer kept Tarianna his prisoner, he continued to watch the Thing's hunt for him.[11]He also began torturing Tarianna by forcing her to witness the various points in Ben Grimm's life. After revealing to her his troubled childhood and his transformation into the Thing, Grimm the Sorcerer revealed himself to be a double of Ben.[6]\nFantastic Four costume.[1]"

Inside the package was a box that was supposedly going to provide them with their wildest fantasies. However it instead bombarded the group with cosmic rays and mutated them. Jack would be mutated into a rock skinned creature of super-human strength.\nJack would be dubbed theThing, and the group would adventure as theFantastic Four. Living double lives, they would work at Marvel Comics by day, and operate as the Fantastic Four out of the Baxter Building. The group would adapt their adventures into a fictional comic book which would become very popular.\nWhen Jack and the others would visit the island ofDr. Morrowthey would find that Morrow himself had been mutated into a giant monster. Defeating Morrow they would search his lab and find that he too was sent a box by the S People. After returning from Morrow's island, Jack would almost quit the team until he learned how to shift back and fourth between his human and Thing forms. Travelling to Atlantis, Jack and the others would be captured by theSub-Marinerwho also received a box and believe it was the Fantastic Four who sent it to him. Jack and the others would battle Namor until the truth came out. They would soon learn that the S People were really alien Skrulls who sought to use the boxes to make everyone on Earth their mindless slaves.\nThe Fantastic Four and Namor would team up to destroy the Skrull base, thwarting their plot. With no cure found, they would continue to operate as heroes and comic book publishers.[1]"

Much like their Earth-616 counterparts,Reed Richards,Susan Storm,Johnny StormandBen Grimmwould take an unauthorized flight in Reed's experimental rocket into space and be exposed to Cosmic Ray. In this reality, the Fantastic Four would all obtain different powers:\nReed Richards would become a disembodied brain with great telepathic abilities, dubbed Big Brain; Sue Storm would gain elastic powers and take on the identity of Ultra-Woman; Johnny the power to turn into a humanoid robot form that could generate powerful electric blasts, calling himself Mandroid; lastly Ben Grimm would grow reptilian style wings and become known as Dragonfly.\nMuch like on Earth-616 they would form into the Fantastic Four, and set up operations in theBaxter Buildingin New York City. They would clash with such foes asMiracle Man,Sub-Mariner, theSkrulls, and theMole Man.\nIn this realityDr. Doomwould be likewise a despotic ruler from Latveria, however his scientific prowess would yield lesser advances as he had not developed a time machine like his Earth-616 counterpart. He would employ a demon to steal Black Beards treasures from a museum, however the creature would be stopped by the Fantastic Four. Seeking to destroy the FF after learning that their leader Big Brain was his old university rival Reed Richards. While the Fantastic Four would otherwise be distracted, Dr. Doom would approach Richards and offer him a new body, working on his fears of losing Sue Storm's love to Ben Grimm. However, even though Doom would learn that it was all a deception on Doom's part. As the FF would come to Reed's rescue in Latveria, Doom would gain the upper hand in battle. Richards would unleash the full mental powers on Doom to save his comrades in general, and Sue in particular. In the resulting assault Doom would attempt to blow them both up. Doom would fail, and Reed would use his powers to switch minds with Doom. In Doom's body now, Richards would rename himself to Mr. Fantastic[1].\nThe Fantastic Four of Earth-7712 would next be used as pawns of theTime Variance Authorityto stopImmortusfrom absorbing enough chronal energy to take over the all time. The Fantastic Four would be sent to confront the past version of Immortus and prevent him from absorbing a massive amount of chronal energy. Threatened by their appearance, Nathaniel Richards would activate advanced weaponry to kill them[2]. While a number of those used by the TVA in theTimequakeevent were restored to life afterward it remains unrevealed if the Fantastic Four of Earth-7712 were revived along with them."

In the original timeline, theAvengershad prevented the war from reaching Earth, which no longer appeared to have been the case. Patrolling the graveyard were members of Starkguard. The two of them went toNew York City, and found it intact but greatly changed. It was now a city which was defended by a fleet of airborne carriers. They encountered theDefenderswho believed them to be Skrulls, forcing them into a running fight with the Defenders, which they eventually ended with their captures, at which pointTony Starkarrived with an escort of drones.[2]\nThe two of them were turned over to Tony Stark, who with the help ofXavierandEmma Frostwere able to confirm that they \nwere from an alternate reality where humanity was exterminated by Ultron and that they went back in time to change the future. Which they succeeded at creating this new reality but in the process they broke the timeline. Tony Stark explained to Wolverine the changes that happened due to the murder of Henry Pym. After his murder, the Avengers soon broke up. In the battle between magic and technology, magic won. He lost half his body in the Latveria-Asgard Wars, which is the last time that Thor was seen as Asgard abandoned the human race.

After being bombarded by the radiation, the ship was damaged and crashed landed.\nAs Ross pulled himself from the wreckage, he found that Talbot had died. All of a sudden, he noticed that his body started to change into a orange-colored, thick-skinned, heavily-muscled, and superhumanly strong rock creature. Scared of his appearance, he disappeared into the forest.[1]\nCalling himself the Thing, he later became the leader of theresistanceagainst the Baron ofDystopia,Maestro. Ross was at the rebel base when when of his fighters,Ruby Summersbrought an elderly man there who claimed he was anAsgardiannamedOdinso he could rest.\nBut this was a ruse, as it turned out that \"Odin\" was really the Maestro in human form. He started to attack the rebels, which drew the Thing's attention.[2]A battle broke out between the two behemoths which resulted in everyone being evacuated above ground.\nThing vs. Trolls\nAfter trading blows back and forth the Maestro gained the upper-hand by knocking Ross out while his soldiers showed up in time to back him up. He then took Thing back to his palace as a prisoner.\nWith the Thing immobilized, Maestro told him about his plans to overthrow God-Doom and asked for his help, which made him curious.[1]He was looking for the legendaryDestroyer armorwhich according to a book was powerful enough to take out Doom. Maestro asked Ross for his help and he agreed if it meant that he wouldn't be the Baron of Dystopia anymore.\nAs they talked about their uneasy alliance, Thing's rebel friends broke into the palace thinking he was being held prisoner which in fact the opposite he told them they would be joining forces with the Maestro instead.[3]\nThing beats down Ulik\nThing along with his resistance group followed the Maestro toNorseheim, where according to the book stolen from Doom would lead them toUlik the Trollwho knew of the location of the armor. To get information about Ulik's whereabouts, the group entered a local pub and foundHoder, who revealed to them that Ulik was inNornheimand told them where they would find its entrance.\nUpon entering Nornheim and Ulik's cave, Thing and the others were immediately attacked by Ulik's horde of trolls while Maestro took on Ulik himself. Defeated, Ulik was forced to tell them the location of the armor. He then guided them to theAncient One, who they learned was actually Rick Jones and also the guardian of the Destroyer armor.[4]"

The grief preventedMister Fantasticfrom driving Galactus away. Instead,Doctor Doomstepped in and used a machine to take over Galactus' body. Taking up the Devourer's role in the universe, Doom swore he would never succumb to devouring the Earth. Mister Fantastic was heavily affected by this series of events and disappeared for years.\nIn an attempt to escape from the destruction of their homeworld (most likely at Doom's hands), the Skrulls carried out a mass exodus and infiltrated humanity, replacing a million people before being found out. The super hero community rallied together against the invaders, and in the process fell under the jurisdiction ofS.H.I.E.L.D., withSue Stormheading up the organization's superhuman division. The captured Skrulls were imprisoned at theNega-Prisonin theNegative Zone.\nRoughly a decade after Doom had taken over Galactus, he had kept his promise. And while he didn't devour the Earth, he consumed everything else in the universe.[1]The retiredSilver Surfergave theHuman Torchhis Power Cosmic so that he could become the Earth's artificialSun.[2]Reed Richards returned shortly after the Skrull invasion was thwarted, and worked non-stop to \"make things better\" and make up for having failed all those years earlier.[1]\nDespite the tragedy that befell the Fantastic Four, Earth's heroes actually thrived in this reality, since several deceased heroes in the Prime Marvel Universe appear alive and well."

When his friendReed Richardsbuilt his own starship, Ben agreed to serve as pilot. When cosmic rays penetrated their shielding, the radiation transformed Grimm into the grotesque, Stone-hided strongman dubbed theThing.[1]The Thing was a member of theFantastic Four.[2]\nWith the Tesseract being held in Latveria, Fury acquired the assistance of theFantastic Fourto stormDoom's castle afterS.H.I.E.L.D.provided cleanup assistance for the Baxter Building.  With the Four and Fury taking theFantasti-Carto Latveria, they were met with incoming fire, Fury and Torch split up with the rest of the team to secure the landing zone, while Reed set the Fantasti-Car to autopilot and landed on Latverian soil with Sue and Ben. The three found Green Goblin's helicopter, along with a group of Doombots and their line to Fury jammed. Fighting their way through the Doombots and disabling the satellite that was blocking the signal, Fury sent the team a distress call, having met heavy resistance on the other side of the castle. Eventually meeting up with Johnny and Fury, the five were forced to trigger the security alarm to gain access to the elevator, as this would cause many Doombots to be brought down from the interiors of the castle and thus grant them access to the Elevator. Upon reaching Doom's lair, the five were met byGreen Goblinwho attacked them, knocking Johnny Storm unconscious, and sending Doombots after the rest. Eventually, the four were able to knock out Goblin. Afterwards, Johnny regained consciousness and the five confronted Doom. However, they were then crushed under rocks as a result ofLoki's blasts.The five survived this attack, clearing up the rubble and bringing the capturedSilver Surferback to the helicarrier.[2]\nUponMagnetostealing aRoxxonnuclear source, Thing andCaptain Americawere flown to Magneto's location byBlack Widow. Landing on the island that Asteroid M was held, Thing went through a rough landing, smashing into the ground and burying him in the sand. Captain America helped Grimm out of the sand and the pair explored the island, finding and taking out severalBrotherhoodbases along the way. Eventually, they found a group of dinosaurs taken from theSavage Landbefore they found Magneto raising the island. After being cornered by a group of Dinosaurs, the two were rescued byStormwho joined them in their quest to take down Magneto. The three eventually encounteredMystiqueposing asMagneto, using a metal-bending gun to further the pretense, andRhinowho had taken refuge on the island. After Thing was able to beat Rhino in a fight, the three used nearby Debris to break through Mystique's metal shield. Despite their efforts, however, Asteroid M still rose, though they were still able to capture Mystique.[2]\nPursuing Asteroid M, the three foundSpider-Manstanding alone againstLokiandDoom. They decided to help Spider-Man, prompting the two to retreat to the upper levels. Fighting Magneto Acolytes and Doombots along the way, the four were able to activate an elevator to the outer corridors of the space station, where they were met by minions and security measures, including several security turrets. Opening a door to a joining connection bridge despite the securities' systems warnings, the quartet were sucked out into space, eventually landing back in the space station where they confronted Doctor Doom.With Doom channeling his newfound power into a forcefield and Loki out of reach, the team fought a wave of standard Doombots, V-Series Doombots and Magneto Acolytes before Doom channeled his powers into a laser cannon, allowing Captain America to deflect it, destroying the cannons and allowing them to fight him directly. After working through the rest of his defences, the heroes were finally able to defeat Doom, with the Thing punching him into space. After Iron Man and Thor rejoined the group Loki revealed his master plan, use the Doom Ray to take control of Galactus and have it devour Earth and Asgard. Loki demonstrated this, having Galactus destroy Asteroid M, causing the 6 heroes to crash-land on the helicarrier. Team One worked to repair one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. turbines, eventually directing the subsequent wind to Galactus.[2]\nFaced with the prospect of global annihilation,S.H.I.E.L.D.and Earth's mightiest heroes made an alliance with various villains who had previously been hired by Doctor Doom and Loki. Thing was assigned to 'Team One', withSpider-Man,Mystiqueand Green Goblin. Team One worked to repair one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. rotos, eventually directing the subsequent wind to Galactus. Eventually, the earth was saved, with Team Three summoning a Black Hole and Team Four knocking Galactus and Loki into it. As per Fury and Doom's earlier agreement, the villains were given a thirty second head-start to escape, an idea that was unintentionally sabotaged by Hulk's inability to count to three, allowing the villains to escape.[2]\nCelebrating their victory over Galactus, Tony Stark held a wrap party at Stark Tower. Thing attended the party and, much like the other guests, found it lifeless and boring. However, Thing was able to get into the party once Tony and Rhodey were able to assemble a DJ Station, a disco ball and repair a speaker Hulk had broken.[2]"

He was withMister Fantastictalking withHuman Torchover how the symbiote was bonding and corrupting Spider-Man into murdering criminals.[1]\nSpider-Man eventually separated from the symbiote. However, the symbiote blamed Mister Fantastic for the separation and thus forcibly Reed with it. Then it used Reed's intellect to extract new symbiotes from itself and forcibly bonded one of these symbiotes with Ben.[2]\nThe symbiote also forced Reed to augment the symbiotes so they didn't have its weakness. To prevent anyone from interfering, the symbiote engulfed theBaxter Buildingwith symbiote biomass. When Spider-Man arrived, the symbiote allowed him to enter and was followed by theHuman Torchand Spider-Man's girlfriendMary Jane Watson. The symbiote sent Ben to deal with the intruders. Johnny was forced to hide, leaving Spider-Man to fight Ben. Spider-Man almost defeated Ben but he had to reach Reed. So, he forced Ben outside so theAvengersandX-Factorcould deal with him. Shortly after, the symbiote unleashed a swarm of symbiotes uponNew York City.[3]"

This resulted in a world whereThorispresident of the United States, and everyone onEarthhas Super Powers.\nIn this universe,Reed Richards,Sue Storm,Johnny StormandVictor Van Dammenever gained powers through a failed experiment, but rather they, as well as the rest of the world, were granted powers by ingesting specialSkrull Pills, provided by an alien race known as theSkrulls.Ben Grimmwas the only human being on earth who chose to remain powerless.\nHaving become a \"planet of capes\", the Super-Skrull arranged a diplomatic mission to earth, to allegedly see how things were progressing. Super-Skrull soon activated pico-bots which duplicated the powers of every super-human into his Anti-Assassination armor. Richards and Johnny Storm died trying to defeat the Super-Skrull.  The flaw in the plan was revealed when all super-humans on the planet died, leaving the armor with no powers to duplicate.  This left only the non-powered Ben Grimm who pummeled Super-Skrull with his fists and left him to die in this earth's toxic atmosphere.[1]"

The actual intent would be to turn people into mindless slaves. To field test this plot, the Skrulls would mail out various boxes to different beings on the Earth. One such box would be mailed to the offices of Marvel Comics where it would be opened by its bullpen. EmployeesStan Lee,Sol Brodsky,Jack KirbyandFlo Steinbergwould all be bombarded by cosmic rays from the device until Jack smashed it with his shoe. The group would find that they had all been mutated. Stan having stretching powers, Flo able to turn invisible, Sol able to combust into flame, and Jack transformed into a monstrous rock skinned creature. Deciding to try and find out who the S People were and get cured, they would become theFantastic Four.\nThey would go on many adventures, and use them as inspiration to publish a fictional Fantastic Four comic book which maintained a great deal of popularity. They would set up shop in the Baxter Building and develop many devices to help them in their adventures.\nWhen on an island owned byDr. Morrowthe team would be attacked by a creature that, upon defeating it, they would learn that was Morrow himself. Realizing that he was likely mutated in much the same way as them, they would check his lab and find another similar box from the S People. Returning to their headquarters Jack would attempt to leave the group, however in convincing him that he can shift back and fourth between human and thing forms, he would agree to stay.\nSeeking aid from Atlantis, the Fantastic Four would be attacked by theSub-Marinerwho would accuse them of sending him one of the same boxes that mutated them and Dr. Morrow. After a brief battle, they would convince Namor of the truth and Namor, and deciding that the S People were  possibly aliens would use his extraterrestrial detector. Sure enough, his hunch would be correct and they would detect an alien being in the very room. The Skrull would reveal itself but knock everyone out with a vacuum capsule and make his escape.\nThe Fantastic Four and Namor would revive and chase after the Skrull tracking it to its secret base and destroy it and all the cosmic ray boxes foiling the Skrulls invasion plans[2]."

It should also be noted that while \"year ten\" on of the modern age of Earth-616 will always be moving forward in time, the year that Ben Grimm-616 visited\nthis reality will always be the calendar year 1998.\nEvents on this world appear to be more or less analogous to Earth-616, despite the differences, but the timeframe moves much slower.\nIn the year 1961 scientistReed Richards, test pilotBen Grimm, Reed's fiancéSusan Storm, and her little brotherJohnnywent on an unauthorized rocket flight into space in order to beat the Soviet Union in the space race.

Emerging from the rocket the four adventurers discovered that they had been endowed with super-human abilities from the cosmic rays. Reed Richards could stretch his body, Sue could turn invisible, Johnny could burst into flame, and Ben was transformed into a inhuman thing. Calling themselves Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, the Human Torch and the Thing, respectively they all agreed to use their powers for the good of mankind. They formed this world's premier group of superheroes known as theFantastic Four. They became the vanguard of a new era of super heroes.\nThe early 60s saw the birth of other superheroes as well includingSpider-Man, theHulk,Iron Man,Thor,Captain America,Daredevil,Doctor Strangeand the heroicAvengers. While details of the exploits of these heroes are mostly unknown, these exploits are more or less similar to their Earth-616 counterparts, however the passage of time in which these events advanced much slower. During this period the Fantastic Four's Thing began a relationship with blind sculptressAlicia Mastersin 1962. The Torch also had a romance withCrystala member of theInhumansin 1967. Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Girl got married in the year 1963 and gave birth to their sonFranklinin 1968.\nThe course of history continued on much like it did on Earth-616 only at a slower rate. Johnny and Crystal's relationship ended in 1970 when the pollution of the outside world forced her to return to Attilan. By 1973 she had met and fell in love with the speedster known asQuicksilver. They were married a year later. Things took a dark turn in 1974 when Spider-Man disappeared after the death of his girlfriendGwen Stacyand theGreen Goblin.\nIn the year 1982, Crystal and Quicksilver had a daughter whom they namedLuna. Eventually her and Pietro's relationship ended and Crystal and Johnny reconnected. Although the circumstances are unknown as they differ vastly from the events on Earth-616. In this reality, Johnny and Crystal had a son namedRaymond.\nBy the 1990s, Franklin was a full grown adult who joined up with the Fantastic Four as the \"Zero Man\", requiring a special headdress to keep his powers in check. Luna grew up to be a rebellious teen and began calling herself \"Spike\" after her ability to mentally control her hair. Ray, having developed shape-shifting powers, also joined the Fantastic Four as \"Cosmic Ray\". Reed and Sue retired from heroics and began exploration of the planet Mars. With Alicia Masters developing arthritis, she and the Thing retired to Arizona. Franklin soon started a relationship withWakandanprincessZawadi. In 1995, Captain America sacrificed his life protecting the lives of people in Oklahoma during a bombing attack. In 1996 the heroes of this world stopped the threat of Onslaught on their world, however the details of those events are also largely unrecorded. At some point Daredevil retired from heroics. As Matt Murdock he became the mayor of New York City and used his alter-ego to help promote the construction of schools for children with disabilities.\nBy 1998, Spike had started dating a man named Ozzie who, unaware to her, was the Fantastic Four's old foe theWizard. Not long after this, Bruce Banner passed away due to his failing health. A day later theThingof Earth-616 was accidentally transported to this world thanks to a particle accelerator accident. Confused with the Thing of this reality, the Thing was taken to theFour Freedoms Plazawhere he learned how different this entire reality was and that Franklin and Zawadi were expecting a child and experienced the resentment Spike felt towards her family. Bewildered by of how different things were the Thing ventured toAvengers Mansionwhere he heard a poker game was being played. There he met this reality's versions ofDoctor Strange,Wolverineand Thor, who quickly discovered Ben's true identity mid-game and decided to tell him how everything happened in this reality."

At the age of five he befriendedReed Richardsand the two remained close friends throughout their childhood.[11]At a young age he attended Midtown Middle School, where he became the star linebacker for the school football team, earning himself the nicknameThe Grimm Reaper.\nPossessing an unique intellect, Reed was often the target of school bullies, and Ben took it upon himself to protect Reed from those who would seek to persecute him. As reward for this valuable service, Reed agreed to help Ben with his homework, which was the dread trigonometry.[1]\nAs he looked before his mutation\nBen and Reed parted ways when Reed was only ten-years-old. A government sponsoredthink-tankrecruited Reed into working for them at theBaxter Building. Ben continued with his education and eventually entered college.\nYears later on spring break, Grimm was backpacking across the desert ofNevadawhen he learned that his old school pal was in the area. He visited the testing sight of a teleportation project, which sought to pierce the dimensional barrier into an antimatter realm called theN-Zone. Ben knew that Reed had always experimented with quantum physics, and wanted to see how his old friend was getting along. During the visit, once given an A-Level Clearance,[11]Reed introduced him to his colleagues,Victor van Damme,Sue Stormand her younger brother,Johnny. He invited him to witness the first field test of the N-Zone Initiator.[12]\nThe experiment proved to be a tragic disaster. Moments before the initial testing phase was to commence, Victor Van Damme adjusted the coordinates on the machine causing it to malfunction. It tore open a dimensional breach, releasing a blinding wave of energy, which shunted all five witnesses to different geological locations.\nBen awakened in a small village inMexico. As he rose to his feet, he discovered that he was no longer entirely human. The N-Zone effect increased his body mass, transforming him into a gargantuanthingwith flesh composed of living rock. Members of the Baxter Building research team tracked him down and brought him back to New York for testing. There, Ben learned from Reed that he had made a miscalculation in the experiment that caused them to possess their powers. Ben angrily attacked Reed for his condition before being subdued by Reed's powers. When the Baxter Building was attacked byArthur Molekevic's monster, Ben leapt from the skyscraper and battled the beast. Ben, Reed and Johnny pursued the monster into Molekevic's hidden headquarters beneathManhattan, where they retrieved Susan Storm, though Ben's massive strength inadvertently collapsed Molekevic's chambers.\nThing's original form\nAs the U.S. government wanted to keep the foursome a secret, Ben was confined to the Baxter Building for months after his change and limited to weekly phone calls to his family. He accompanied his teammates toDenmarkto confront Victor Van Damme, and again into the N-Zone on a voyage of exploration. While Reed and Sue had each other, and Johnny was allowed out in public, Ben was the most isolated of the four, unable to pursue his interests or see his friends, his pro football dreams dead. His first real joy since being changed came when the quartet entered the N-Zone and Ben space-walked for the first time; he found similar moments venturing into the Jurassic Era. After the team went public as the Fantastic Four while battling the alienNihilinLas Vegas, Ben slowly began to accept what he'd become, even adopting an old football coach's slogan as his battle cry: \"It's Clobberin' Time!\"\nWhen theUltimatum Wavestruck, Grimm stopped a whale from crashing into a building. After regaining consciousness, he saw to caring for a comatose Susan Storm. When Susan recovered, she and Grimm found Johnny at the ruins ofDr. Strange'sSanctum Sanctorum, being held prisoner by the demonDormammu. The three successfully defeated Dormammu, who was turned into a powerless human being.\nFollowing Magneto's defeat, Reed confided in Ben thatDoctor Doomwas directly responsible for causing the Ultimatum event. Reed concluded that Doom had to be killed to prevent any similar incidents. Grimm complied and personally killed Doom in his own frozen kingdom.[13]FollowingDr. Franklin Storm's funeral, the Fantastic Four disbanded. Ben decided to work forS.H.I.E.L.D.as a pilot as previously recommended by GeneralThunderbolt Ross.[14]\nBen returned to New York to visit Sue. He professed his love for her, but received silence in return. Hurt that she didn't return the sentiment, he left, as a piece of his rocky skin fell off of his arm. Moments later a gelatinous creature attacked her.[7]Ben and Sue managed to fight off the creature long enough for it to successfully complete the destruction of the Baxter Building and self-destruct. They joined Johnny at Reed Richards' home, only to learn of his and his family's death.[15]In a battle atPeter Parker's home, another of the alien creatures managed to hit Ben with an energy blast. When Ben recovered he found that more rocks had fallen from his body and he started to glow with white light.[16]After Sue confessed she loved him back, Ben started to glow more and then exploded. In the wake of the explosion, a glowing purple Ben Grimm in human form emerged.[17]\nIt was soon discovered that Reed Richards had faked his death and was behind the attacks. The gathered heroes located Reed in theNegative Zoneand confronted him with an all-out assault. They bested him and his alien creatures with little effort. Johnny even deformed Reed's face with the hottest flame attack he had ever produced in revenge for hurting his sister.Novaand Spider-Man managed to steal the technology that Reed was using to create his new facility and jump between universes, causing the entire facility to collapse. Reed was flung from the facility, causing him to drift aimlessly in the Negative Zone.\nSue approached Ben and professed her love for him, as he did for her before the attacks started. She proposed to him, stating that every good moment she ever had was because he was near her. Ben accepted, willing to start a new chapter in his life.[18]Ben and Sue later attended Peter Parker's surprise birthday party.[19]\nPurple Glowing Form and Rock-like Skin: The Thing possesses a smooth, rock-like hide as a result of exposure to the extra dimensional energy. The mutagenic process caused his musculature, bone structure, internal organ composition, soft tissue structure, and skin to greatly increase in toughness and density.\nChanging forms at will"

It is a slower-moving reality in which the modern age of heroes was just beginning. The last super-humans recorded as being active on this Earth were Captain America and the Invaders duringWorld War II. Presumably, the history of this world is similar to that ofEarth-616up until the modern era.\nIn this reality,Reed Richardslaunched his rocket into space, much like he did onEarth-616, an event that gave birth to this reality'sFantastic Four. The reality hoppingExileswere sent to this reality to insure that \"nobody died\". However, while they thought they had to merely insure that the Fantastic Four survived their rocket crash back on Earth, they soon realized that their mission was far more difficult. WhenBen Grimmmutated into the Thing, he did so in a more savage form and went on a rampage throughNew York City[1].\nWith the newly empowered Reed Richards,Sue Storm, andJohnny Storm, the Exiles tried to subdue the Thing while preventing any civilian casualties caused by his rampage. Realizing that they needed to stabilize the Thing's mutation, the Exile'sMorphaccompanied Reed Richards to work withTony StarkandOtto Octaviusin creating a device that would do this. During this period the Exile'sMimicfought the Thing on his own. Although the Thing was cured, Mimic was severely injured causing him to succumb to theBroodembryo that his healing factor had been fighting off after a six month stay onEarth-2942[2]."

Much like on Earth-616, Grimm accompaniedReed Richardson the fated rocket flight that created theFantastic Four. After being exposed to cosmic rays and transformed into a Thing, Grimm returned to his apartment inNew Amsterdamshortly after the formation of the Fantastic Four. There he was confronted by his Earth-616 counterpart, who was attempting to travel back in time with a serum that would have cured the Thing at an earlier point in the evolution of his Thing form. Not believing his counterparts intent, Thing-7940 attack Thing-616 and a brawl broke out in the streets. Eventually Thing-616 overpowered his less experienced counterpart and administer the serum which caused Thing-7940 to revert back to his human form. Thinking that the changes would affect him once he returned to his own time, Thing-616 left in hisTime Platform. However there, the Thing was informed by theMister Fantasticof his home reality that his interactions in the past merely created a divergent reality.[1][note 1]"

However, in a battle with Miracle Man and a monster statue brought to life by the villain, a  seemingly abandoned building caught fire. The team however decided that, since the building is condemned already, there’s no reason they shouldn’t just go bring in Miracle Man and then use their powers to stop the fire once they’re finished. Unbeknown to them however, a single mother waitress and her daughter had taken up residence in the building. When the team finally came back to put out the fire, they found an exhausted firefighter with a dead little girl in his arms and a mother screaming at them for being murderers. Horrified by how they unintentionally let a little girl die, the team disbanded for good."

His intellect remained active within Earth's computers and as far SHIELD could tell, Vision was now in every computer and electronic system on Earth. The world is told by Ultra-Vision not to panic, for he had taken over the world's computers to ensure a new future for mankind, starting with putting an end to the threat of nuclear war. He informs the world that he intends to rule them but not as a tyrant and hopes humanity works with him in forging a new future.\nUnder the supervision of Captain America and other superheroes, the world's nuclear arsenal is dismantled. As peace reigns on Earth, the defense industries start to shut down. X-Factor and others work the streets of major cities feeding the homeless. Financial resources that were once used in the arms race were now used to help the homeless. In Africa, the Black Panther and other heroes supervise greatly increased harvests, brought about by Western investment and the superior technology of Wakanda and others. Led by Reed Richards, computer efficient power stations that use solar energy are constructed. In the Amazon, Thor cause rain to pour on the jungle. No longer are political dissent and democracy suppressed in the world, as millions now have access to the Vision thru through computer terminals. Within a few years, the world is finally united as the \"United Earth\".\nThe combined military forces of Earth are now in charge of space exploration, and built a permanent space station. Wolverine leads the grown up New Mutants on a mission to Mars where they plant the flag of the United Earth. Mutants are now idolized, and lead the first wave of space pioneers and colonizers. With the development of faster than light propulsion, mankind is finally able to travel the stars. During the next century and a half, humanity expands across the stars. In the year 2156, the Cosmic Avengers were summoned by Starhawk. Who informed that since Earth became a galactic power they had been constantly challenging the older empires of the Skrulls and Kree, and Starhawk had learned that they had recently joined forces to destroy Earth.\nThe Skrulls and Kree had decided that directly attacking Earth with their forces would result in a great bloody and devastating galactic war, as the humans had too many allies, including the Rigellians and Aakon. It would be a war that they were not guaranteed to win and therefore it was decided to cause Halley's comet to crash into Earth, making it look like the destruction of Earth was a cosmic accident and thereby putting an end to the Human Alliance. By this time on Earth, the United States was just one of many states and it was nowhere near being the most important state. Starhawk led the Cosmic Avengers to Halley's Comet, who then assaulted the Kree and Skrull forces. Where they emerge victorious, killing the Supremor and the Mega-Skrull robot, and forcing the rest of the Kree and Skrull to retreat."

Upon their successful merging they would be intruded upon by Ben Grimm who, not realizing that the creature was a combination of his three friends, would get in it's way and it would callously knock him aside into some devices. The energies given off by the X-Man would ultimately mutate Ben back into the Thing. This time however the Thing would have increased strength and have a total malice toward humanity and would bound away from Reed and the others following the defeat of Galactus. Ben would become of significant menace to prompt the government to mobilize \"Operation: Thing\" (led byGeneral Ross) to try and capture and contain the Thing.[1]"

Smash gained an enhanced physiology, with super strength and durability.[1]\nCalling himselfMister Fantastic, the Mad Thinker took his new Fantastic Four toan alternate universewhere theHuman TorchandThe Thinghad become stuck during a multiversal journey in the search for their family.[2]The Mad Thinker intended to eliminate them to consolidate his team, since he believed they needed to declutter the void left by the Fantastic Four from its remnants. Despite the fact that both the Human Torch and The Thing were powerless, they managed to hold their own against the Thinker's team. When Smash tried to take down The Thing, he lured him to an abandoned building. Dodging her blows, he made Smash destroy the building's support beams, causing it to collapse on top of her. After dealing with the remaining members of the Fantastic Four, the Human Torch and The Thing escaped.[1]"

This parasite could infect people, turning them into zombie-like creatures known asThe Respawned.[1]\nFrom there, the Respawned proceeded to devour whole galaxies, and eventually, a large group of the Respawned made its way to the edge of Earth'sSolar System, using Galactus' zombified corpse as transport. ThenCaptain Marvel, having been turned into one of the Respawned, sent out a distress signal at Galactus' coordinates, luring a team ofAvengers,X-Men, and theFantastic Fourto investigate.\nWhen this team arrived, they were ambushed by Captain Marvel and the large horde of Respawned, whose members includedGroot,Gamora,Silver Surfer,Nova, andGladiator. The ensuing battle resulted in the infection or death of the whole team[2](except forWolverine)[1]at the hands of the Respawned.[2]\nFollowing the battle, the Galactus Hive made its way to Earth with the Respawned, and the Hunger Cosmic spread to the general population as well as metahumans.[3]By the time of the invasion ofNew York City, a small resistance of heroes and villains had formed underground,[4]whileS.H.I.E.L.D.andA.I.M.had formed a coalition with the goal of stopping the Respawned, and fought the Galactus Hive in New York.[2]\nAt one point, the S.H.I.E.L.D.-A.I.M. coalition tried to use non-organic beings and robots as soldiers against the Respawned --known asEnnows-- since they couldn't be turned by the Hunger Cosmic. They also designed a strain of the Transmode Virus to infect human survivors and protect them from zombification, although this would result in their loss of humanity.[5]\nThe coalition also built Space Arks, which are implied to have successfully left Earth, and at the same time, rehabbedAtlantisinto a colony for air-breathers, the latter of which was proven unsuccessful as the Respawned managed to invade and infect seemingly all of Atlantis.[1]\nEventually, communications went down (presumably along with the coalition) as the planet was decimated and the general population fell to zero. Following this, the Ennows began fighting for themselves, establishing a fortified city known as thePhalanx Walland clashing with the Respawned for dominance of the planet. Meanwhile, the Respawned started to gather themselves inLimbo(now known as Blackspring) with the Galactus Hive, aiming to invade the rest of the Multiverse once they had consumed all of Earth's metahumans.[6]"

In a turn of events, Steve was chosen to became the test subject of Project Rebirth'sSuper-Soldier Serum, becomingCaptain America. Steve remained loyal to Hydra and acted as a spy within the Allied forces.[5]\nRogers at Ashomia to protect him from the reality warp\nYears into the war, the Allies focused on the creation of a Cosmic Cube with the intention to use it to win the war.[6]Nostradamushad predicted this. Rogers was summoned to the ancient city ofAshomiainJapan, where he encountered theKraken, Nostradamus, and Hydra's father SirIsaac Newton. Rogers was submerged into a special pool to be shielded from the imminent alteration of all of reality.[7]\nThen, the world was changed intoonewhere Hydra didn't win WWII, and Steve Rogers never served Hydra.[7]In truth, this is the way events naturally occured, until Kobik made it so it could be believed the timeline she fabricated, in which Captain America served Hydra, was the original.[1]Once the Hydra loyalist Rogers secretly resurfaced in the place of the real one,[8]he set out to use Kobik to reshape reality in Hydra's image and restore the world to how it was, or rather, how he thought it was. This plan suffered a major setback when the fragments of Kobik were scattered around the world.[9]\nRogers using the Cosmic Cube to rewrite reality to his own Hydra reality\nAfter collecting all but one of Kobik's fragments, Rogers obtained enough power to rewrite reality. As he changed the world to a continuation of his, Rogers caught a glimpse of how other historical events would have differed in his timeline. Steve was then tricked bySam Wilsoninto bringing back Kobik, who proceeded to undo all changes in history, and brought back the real Captain America so he could defeat his fascist doppelganger.[1]"

Captain Marvel Had Not Died?GalleryOfficial NameEarth-906[2]StatusExistingCreators and AppearancesCreatorsMatthew Jorgensen,FirstWhat If...?#14(April, 1990)\nMar-Velldiscovered that he had cancer years earlier than in Earth-616. He undergoes an examination byDr. Strange,Mr. Fantastic, and Don Blake, and undergoes a treatment at their hands in the Plane of Rashnu, where time doesn't exist. Having cheated death, Mar-Vell feels guilty he hasn't taken advantage of his second chance to achieve things he wouldn't have dreamed of before. He heads out into space withElysius, with the objective of ending the Kree-SkrulL War.\nAt the edge of the Andromeda galaxy, he finds two great armadas,KreeandSkrull. Mar-Vell tears through the weapons bays of the Kree Star Destroyers. Then does the same to the Skrull warships, after which he orders an immediate truce between the two in a broadcast transmitted via theOmni-Wave Projector. Threatening to destroy the two fleets with it if they refused to obey, and demanding that each fleet send an embassy to negotiate peace. The demand is heard across the Andromeda, Kree, and Milky Way galaxies.\nTheSilver Surferthen senses that the life force of two galaxies was being disrupted and headed to the Fantastic Four 's headquarters. Only to discover that a contagious plague is spreading across Earth, whose symptoms were identical to the cancer that had been afflicting Mar-Vell. While the emissaries argue with each other (and likewise Dorrek VII and the Supreme Intelligence via video screens), Kree and Skrull commandos attempt to infiltrate Mar-Vell's ship. Dr. Strange and Silver Surfer go to Titan, where they discover that the plague has likewise hit that moon.\nBack in the Skrull empire, the plague spreads across the galaxy, known to the Skrulls as the Wasting Illness. The Skrulls suspect it of being a Kree bio-weapon and vow to take the Kree down with them. Meanwhile the Silver Surfer encounters a Kree warship and discovers that the Kree likewise are being ravaged by a plague, one which they call the Blackend and which they blame on the Skrulls. They ask that he lead them to Skrulls, so that the Kree can die like warriors. In the meantime, Mar-Vell has been attacking Kree weapons plants. Silver Surfer finds Mar-Vell and they battle, as the Silver Surfer attempts to convince Mar-Vell that he is spreading a plague across the stars. Back on Earth, Reed Richards has an epiphany, that Rick Jones was immune and therefore was the source of the cure.\nFinally Mar-Vell is defeated by the Silver Surfer, who brings him on board Mar-Vell's ship and gets Mar-Vell to look into Elysius who was dying with his cosmic awareness. Upon which he discovered the suffering of all those daying across the cosmos from the plague and the threat that he posed to all humanoid species across the universe. Dr. Strange appears to give them the good news, that they found a cure. Which functioned best as a vaccine for those who were either uninfected or were in the disease's early stages. It worked only on humans though, so to save Elysius they gave her a dose of the cure augmented by Silver Surfer's power cosmic."

In this reality, mutants in general, and super-heroes in particular are well regarded by humanity and are treated like celebrities, much like in the mainDC Universe. Even beings such as theHulk, who has appeared on the cover of Newstime, are regarded highly. Super-hero teams active in this reality include theAvengers, theFantastic Fourand theX-Men. This reality also has its own version of theBrotherhood of Evil Mutants.\nIn this reality,Calvin Rankinwas born a mutant with the power to mimic up to five mutant abilities at one time at a fraction of their power. He grew up with his father, a scientist with poor business sense. Living a life of poverty, he became a petty thief until the day his mutant powers manifested. They were triggered by his proximity to the originalX-Menwhen they were in their civilian guises. Mimicking their abilities, Calvin became the costumed Mimic, and joined up with theBrotherhood of Evil Mutants. During the Brotherhoods subsequent clash with the X-Men, the group was defeated. The core members retreated, leaving the knocked out Mimic behind to be captured. In prison, he was offered the chance of being released byCharles Xavierif he agreed to join hisSchool for Gifted Youngsters. Deciding it was better than prison, Calvin accepted the Professor's invitation and became an active member of the X-Men. Training with the group, he helped them master their abilities, and he soon became leader of the team over the more timid Cyclops. Calvin became a long standing member of the X-Men, seeing them through many tragedies and triumphs. Calvin also opened his own chain of record stores, wrote a book and ran a charity with fellow X-ManWarren Worthington[1].\nMimic was plucked out of his reality by theTimebreakersto be one of the founding members of the reality jumpingExiles, a team gathered to fix damaged realities[2]. Mimic became a long standing member of the group, at one point being their leader. He ultimately died at the hands ofEarth-58163'sProteus[3]. His body was returned to his home reality by his teammate and loverBlink[4]. During the funeral service, Blink was offered a membership in this world's X-Men. With her job with the Exiles unfinished, she politely declined[5].\nThe rosters of leading super-hero and villain teams are different in this reality, most notably those of theX-MenandBrotherhood of Evil Mutants. The original roster of the Brotherhood consisted ofQuicksilver, his sisterScarlet Witch,Toad, theBlobandMimic. Mimic soon left the Brotherhood to join theX-Men. Whether or not the Brotherhood are still together is unknown.\nThe X-Men have had a number of different rosters over the years. Much like on Earth-616, the original roster of the team consisted ofCyclops,Iceman,Beast,Angel,Marvel GirlandProfessor X. Another roster consisted ofStorm, Mimic, Cyclops,Shadowcat,Gambit,Colossus,Nightcrawler,Wolverineand an unidentified female mutant. At one pointBishopwas a member of the team. The most recent known roster included Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Gambit and Colossus.\nWhile their entire roster has not been divulged, knownAvengershave includedCaptain America,Iron ManandShe-Hulk.\nThis reality is also home to a group ofMorlocks, however their roster is unknown at this time.\nIn this reality,Reed Richardsobtained invisibility powers instead of his regular stretching powers.\nIn this reality,Susan Stormmostly obtained stretching powers instead of her regular invisibility powers."

One of the crew died, and the others, Ben included, mutated. They were captured and forced to battle in \"the Games\", except for Reed Richards, who managed to escape and set up a secret lab.\nDuring his time in the games, Ben battled many opponents, including Piotr Rasputin. When Galactus' herald Terrax arrived on Earth, he caused a power failure which freed all superhumans, Ben included, from imprisonment. During the battle with Terrax, Alex Summers and Johnny Storm blast him out of the sky, and the Banner Beast and Ben beat him up on the ground. Soon all heroes that are left standing join the fight and Terrax' fate is sealed.\nDuring the battle with Galactus, Ben combined his strength with Piotr and Banner, while Shiro Yoshida, Johnny Storm and Ororo Munroe attacked from the air. Usually Galactus' herald would deal with such attacks, but the master proves that he can deal with it too, and the heroes were sent flying.\nThe Thing received his powers when cosmic rays bombarded his body. Ben's powers represent the element of earth.\nRock-like Skin: Ben possesses a smooth, rock-like hide as a result of exposure to cosmic rays. The mutagenic process caused his musculature, bone structure, internal organ composition, soft tissue structure, and skin to greatly increase in toughness and density.\nExpert Pilot: Ben is an exceptionally skilled and experienced pilot, proficient with many varieties of both conventional and exotic aircraft\nExperienced Astronaut: Ben has also trained as an astronaut and was piloting Reed Richard's Skrullship during the team's fateful bombardment with cosmic rays."

He knows enough to fire blasts from his hands, create force-fields, invoke mystical entities (principalities) for additional support, ensnare foes in bands of energy (the Crimson Bands ofCyttorak), and create portals to other planes of existence. However, he considers his scientific abilities to be more important and has devices that do many of the same things."

Their personality traits affected the ways in which they were mutated. Ben Grimm, who had always loved flying, grew wings. He agreed with the others to use their powers for the benefit of mankind, becoming the Fantastic Four.\nHe and Sue began contemplating a relationship after Reed's transformation into Big Brain caused her to grow distant from him. Their developing relationship caused Reed to be tricked by Doctor Doom, who had promised to help him regain a human body, to power his time machine.\nAfter Reed was trapped by Doom and his psychic energy was being used to power the time machine, Ben and the others fought their way into Doom's castle. After they had managed to reach the chamber, they were easily overpowered by Doom, who managed to activate the time machine, which exploded. Big Brain's form was destroyed, but not before he could transfer his mind into Doom's body, displacing Doom's mind. Ben remained with the Fantastic Four after Reed renamed himself Mister Fantastic.[1]"

Ben and Reed's loverSue Stormwas among those evacuated from Manhattan to Europe, at the ultimate sacrifice of Reed and Sue's brotherJohnny.[1]\nInLondon, Ben became a member of theHuman High Council'ssecurity force, likely due to his experience as a pilot and a soldier. Sue joined him there, and the two became lovers. In recent times the two were coming in for a landing at the Eurasian airfield when it suddenly exploded. Narrowly escaping the explosion, the pair landed and investigated the cause of the blast, encountering the giant mutate known as theThing. Attacked by the near impervious creature, Sue sent it fleeing after blasting off its ear. Chasing after the creature, they found Bruce Banner, a scientist working for the Council (and unknown to them a traitor working for Apocalypse's forces under the alter ego of the Thing). Banner asked them to take him to Buckingham Raze whereMikhail Rasputin, a Horseman of Apocalypse was giving peace talks to the Human High Council. There they were joined by security chiefVictor von Doom, inventorTony Starkand his colleaguesDonald BlakeandGwen Stacyin hearing Mikhail's speech. Upon learning that Mikhail was only using these \"peace talks\" as an ends to exterminate humanity, Ben and the others were captured and taken for cybernetic experimentation.[1]"

There he found human-mutant relations in utter chaos: His ownX-Menfractured,Havokbrainwashed,ColossusandDazzleramnesiac,Muir Islandunder the influence of theShadow King, and a group known as theMutant Liberation Frontcommitting terrorist acts across the world.\nXavier called a meeting between the X-Men,X-Factor,Excalibur, and theNew Mutants, telling them that they had all fallen apart. Newly appoint New Mutants leaderCabletook offence to this and told Xavier that times had changed and the X-Men needed to take a harder line on their enemies. Xavier admonished Cable, calling him a worse threat thanMagneto, and ordering him removed from stewardship of the New Mutants. This was met by protests from the New Mutants and ultimately a fight between them and the X-Men, ending with the New Mutants escaping. Contacting Cable telepathically, Xavier swore he would wrest back control of the New Mutants from him, and Cable responded by telling him that he was ready to go to war with Xavier if that was what it would come to. Shortly thereafter while Xavier was meeting withCyclopsandMarvel Girl, Cable assassinated them with a bomb, killing all three.\nAt the funeral,Wolverineswore vengeance on Cable and vowed to kill him in retribution for murdering Xavier, whileStormbelieved that Cable should be brought to justice, not murdered. This clash of ideologies lead to the remaining members of the X-Men picking sides.Forge,Colossus,Beast,Strong Guy, and others joined Storm; whilePsylocke,Havok,Archangel,Iceman, andJubileejoined Wolverine.\nWith the death of Xavier, many of the X-Men's foes capitalized on it to strike back at their enemies. Storm's X-Men were caught up trying to stop aGenoshanincursion on the United States;Apocalypsetargeted theScarlet Witch, leading to a battle with theAvengers;Fenrisattacked New York City; and theMutant Liberation Frontattacked theFantastic Four. Worsening human sentiment towards mutants resulted in them targeting theMorlocksleading to many being slain andFreedom Forcebeing charged with forcing them back underground. While in theSavage Land,Zaladaneand herSavage Land Mutateswarred on the world to expand the borders of the Savage Land. Other countries were also destabilized by anti-mutant hysteria;Gideonand theExternalsbegan taking advantage of the violence;Mr. Sinisterdispatched hisNasty Boysto collect the CEOs ofRoxxon Oil, the P.T.L. Club, and the Boy Scouts of America;Sebastian Shaw, fearing the worst, began talks with the President of the United States to restart Project: Wide-Awake.\nMeanwhile, Wolverine's team of X-Men tracked down Cable and the New Mutants. In the ensuing battle, Wolverine ultimately killed Cable who died telling him that Xavier was a better man than Wolverine because he had the strength of his convictions and didn't let his emotions blindly cloud his mind from the mission. Wolverine failed to understand the meaning of this. The Mutant Liberation Front next attacked the remains of the X-Mansion, leading to a clash with Storm's X-Men, but they soon retreated. The X-Men were next attacked by Zaladane and her Mutates, leading to the deaths of Beast, Nightcrawler, andPolaris, and ending with the X-Men fleeing their base. Watching this destruction was Magneto, who decided this was the time to try and unite mutantkind.[2]\nMagneto eventually killed Stryfe, taking over the Mutant Liberation Front, and began accepting other disenfranchised mutants into his army, including members from both Wolverine and Storm's ranks. Magneto launched an attack on Washington D.C., clashing with many of Earth's non-mutant heroes including the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. As Storm's group mourned their losses, Wolverine's team eliminated Mr. Sinister's Nasty Boys, prompting Psylocke to leave and find Storm's group.\nMagneto's group won a victory, taking Washington D.C., however the ousted President of the United States then activated the Sentinels, unleashing them upon America. The Sentinels were easily held at bay by Magneto's magnetic powers, however they cut across the country eliminating mutants and other super-human threats that resisted capture. Those who were captured were put in internment camps. The Fantastic Four, New Warriors, and Savage Land Mutates were all be wiped out. Wolverine's group was decimated, with Havok and Archangel killed and Iceman captured. Wolverine escaped, vowing to get revenge, while Storm and Psylocke joined Magneto's group for sanctuary."

Nine years after Hyperion's defeat, Earth-4400 was on the road to recovery. However, Hyperion's actions wiped out many of Earth-4400's heroes, allowing the villains to run amok in America. Eventually, the United States passed a law to make superpowers illegal, although this did nothing to cull the amount of super villains.

They are intelligent and have interstellar travel technology.[citation needed]However, they are also a warlike race[4]by tradition (including their wars of succession, orSnarkwar), though some Zn'rx try to break this habit, most notably one of their last emperors,Bhadsha.[citation needed]\nThe Zn'rx are divided into many clans. Each individual clan is led by a queen, who are all married to The Emperor, who rules over all clans. Upon the death of the Emperor, the clans fight wars against each other; the son of the Queen of the winning clan becomes the next Emperor.[8]\nTheZn'rxhailed from a distant section of theMilky Way, on the planet known as \"Snarkworld\", which they shared with the primitive but sentientBurrowers,[1]who lived inCavernsand knew the Zn'rx as the \"(mean)Dragons\".[7]\nTheKymelliansknew the Zn'rx as \"the oldest enemy\".[9]\nThe Zn'rx violently encountered theSkrullsduring a war of succession, centuries ago.[1]\nEmperor Bhadhsa, at least partially encouraged by theKymellianambassador, his childhood friendLord Yrik, initiated reform to the successions rules, intended to eventually move from Snark War to single combat between the High Snarks to determine the Snarks' ruler. This was deeply unpopular to some of his people.[1]\nZn'rx commanderKl'rathwas one of the most ruthless captains in theSnark Armyand attained a high position using that reputation (though attracting powerful enemies). After theSkrull homeworldwas destroyed, Kl'rath attacked and wiped out a whole transport full ofDeviant Skrulls(mostly children). His enemies had him branded as a war criminal, and sent to the inescapable prison ofL'ar Gath Five. Years later, he was killed by Skrull warriorLyja the Lazerfist.[10]\nQueenMarauddiscovered a matter/antimatter device in development onEarth. As part of Maraud's schemes to secure her sonJakal's place on the throne, Maraud attempted to steal the matter/antimatter device. She kidnapped inventorJames Power, and his wifeMargaret. However, thechildrenof James and Margaret received powers from a dyingAelfyre Whitemaneand used them to rescue their parents and keep the matter/antimatter device out of Maraud's hands. The kids accidentally destroyed the device in the process but Maraud had continued to harass the kids of Power Pack since, attempting at multiple times to use them during the most recent Snark war of succession, each time without success however.[citation needed]Such attacks included an attempt thwarted with the help ofObnoxio the ClownandDeadpoolin his black costume (theSymbiote/symbioteVenom), despite the deployment of theSuper-Snark. Defeated into retreat, pursued, they were slaughtered by Deadpool before they could report back to their ruler.[11]With the help of the Burrowers, Jakal and Maraud were eventually defeated;[7]and thanks toYrikand the Power Pack, Bhadsha's consciousness took over Jakal's body, using it to serve as Emperor.  Yrik remained on Snark World, as well as his sonKori,[12]residing among theAnkar Clan,[13]the sole clan Bhadsha fully trusted in his attempts to reform Snark World, and whose High Snark,Prince Sobak, was Bhadsha's choice for his successor (as Bhadsha had no heir of his own) and Kofi's closest friend.[14]\nDuring that period, the Snark Empire seemingly stabilized, and the Snarks seemed to lay low, apart from a group that attackedRick Jonesduring an extraterrestrial bidding war to acquire the rights to his memoirs, but were driven off by Jones and his allies.[6]\nTwo years later, as Bhadsha was about to name Sobak his successor,[14]and thanks to Maraud's plots and scientists, Jakal's consciousness gradually resurfaced in his body and eventually repelled Bhadsha's. At that point, he decided to attack his enemies to put back lesser clans in place, and revealed his identity to Ambassador Yrik before imprisoning him. The Kymellian ambassador silenced, Jakal and Maraud moved to subdue the last clans not united to theirs, the Ankar Clan and the Destrak Clan, as well as taking care of Power Pack. Clan Destrak was swiftly destroyed, the High SnarkRungarwas killed, butMother Destrakmanage to escape with some guardsmen. At this point Kofi and Sobak escaped Snark World aboard the smartshipData, and set course to Earth to enlist the help of Power Pack, soon realizing that Jakal were already on their way.[12]\nOn Earth, Jakal's agents were defeated into retreat by Power Pack. Meanwhile, Jakal gathered the Queen Mothers, presenting them as his true self and proclaiming his plans to reaffirm snark dominance across the galaxy, withAnkaras sole protester. The Snarks returned to the Power's house as Kofi and Sobak arrived, followed by the Snarks.[13]After a skirmish, the Snarks were defeated. Power Pack, Sobak, and Kofi returned to Snark World,[14]just at the time the Zn'rx destroyers annihilated theAnkar Bio-Domes. As they fled into theBurrowers' Caverns, they encountered theBurrowers, who helped them enter the palace.[7]\nMeanwhile, Queen Destrak freed Yrik,[14]assembled her army, and solicited his support (and consequently Kymellia's) to back her up and enable her to evade the tradition and become the first Empress of Snark World, and the Queen Mothers sentRepra, the Rites Master, to protest the assaults on the Ankar and Destrak. Jakal dismissed but Maraud's intervention caused him to snap out and kill her, witnessed by Repra, but also by Sobak, Destrak, and Power Pack,[7]and immediately losing the support of the Queen Mothers.[1]\nAs both Mother Destrak and Prince Sobak claimed the throne, Yrik pointed out that neither could bring peace and stability: Sobak could bring peace but lacked a clan to bring stability, while Destrak had the warriors that could ensure it. Julie suggested that instead of a single emperor, the Zn'rx could use a Triumvirate formed of Sobak and Destrak.\nJakal was defeated and taken in custody by Yrik, who supported the Triumvirate idea as a provisional ruling body that would dictate Snark affairs until the matter of ascension could be worked out, proposing Repra as the third member, and going with Repra to present to the Queen Mothers that option, that he believed would be acceptable to them, though Jack was skeptical if it would last, stating Power Pack would fought another Snark War in a year.[7]\nThe reign of Jakal (described as \"hotheaded\") was considered in overhaul as disastrous.[2]\nAt the time of theDark ReignofNorman Osbornas head of theUnited States of America's national security, peace was achieved under the rule of the ruling triumvirate, thought the Snarks' reputation had been tainted by their wasteful bickering. In his report on individuals and organizations of interest to Osborn, the robotQuasimodoconsidered the Snarks' attempts to obtain weapons and powers from humans was the sign of a deep inferiority, that they should be ignored, and relations with them should be handled byS.W.O.R.D., as the Snarks lacked the resources to invade Earth anyway.[2]\nThe Zn'rx nearRockland,Maine, wearing pieces of human outfits\nAfter the death ofUatu, the Watcher, a Zn'rx scout confirmed the rumors of Earth's forces being in turmoil and its Watcher dead, and considered the planet ready for conquest, but he was snipped by theWinter Soldier (James Barnes), now officiating asThe Man on the Wall, protecting Earth from extraterrestrial and extradimensional threats.[15]\nAnother group resided a few miles north ofRockland,Maine, cut off from their Queen Mother, seemingly attacking humans (those Zn'rx wore human clothes in a grotesque manner) and attempting to reconnect with her to ask the deployment of a strike force to wipe out the planet. Their were detected by theThunderboltsled by Barnes to help on his duty. The Thunderbolts were ambushed by the Snarks, but easily defeated them, and tippedS.H.I.E.L.D.to recover the restrained aliens.[16]\nHyinar, Third Prince of the Zn'rx's royal blood,[17]initiated what became known as theHyinar Usurpation.[18]\nHyinar, along with his agentsDyngoand his brotherKoyoti, followed the counsel of his mother's scientists in scouting for worlds populated by metahumans whose powers they could harvest. Their quest led them to infiltrateCentauri-IV(then the new home of theUniversal Inhumans), disintegratingBlackbaneand kidnappingGorgon. With these acts Hyinar initiated Snarkwar, intending to become the emperor of Snarkworld.\nHyinar and his agents soon struck again, abducting the members of theLight Brigadeand of theAstarion's crew (including many members of theInhuman Royal Family). The trio then captured the Inhuman queens, but were destroyed byFlint. It was hoped that this would be understood by other Snark royalty as a warning that Inhumans of every species were off-limits to Snarkwar.[19]\nThe Hyinar Usurpation derailed any efforts to modernize the Zn'rx succession process and signaled a return to the Snarkwar's barbaric traditions. Ultimately, this would lead toStote[18]ascending to the Zn'rx throne in the following months.\nDuring his brief rule, Stote's traditionalist policies reversed many of the reforms instituted in Bhadsha's era[18]. Stote himself came to be greatly distrusted byNymbis Sternhoof, a Kymellian ambassador, who saw him as a plotter.\nFollowing themergerof theKree Imperiumand of theSkrull Empire, a diplomatic summit was convened at theProsceniumto explore how intergalactic relations would be impacted by the new alliance, to discuss the status of thePan-Worlds Treaties, and to seek a path towards stability and peace among the assembled factions. In attendance were representatives of theKree/Skrull Alliance, theUtopian Kreefaction, theKymellians, theRigellians, theShi'ar,Earth, theGalactic Rim Collective, theBadoon(in fact the weapons dealer andElder of the Universeknown as theProfiteer),Spartax, theChitauri, and the Zn'rx, represented by Emperor Stote himself.\nChaos ensued when the Profiteer, hoping to precipitate another Snarkwar (and the resulting lucrative weapons market), assassinated the Emperor. Further efforts to destabilize the conference were exposed when the attending Chitauri representative, the diplomat-dronePeacebringer, was revealed to have been created as a walking bio-explosive bomb.[20]\nIn the midst of the Proscenium summit chaos, those in attendance received word that planets among theZn'rx Colonies(along with many other worlds) were being stripped of life by the advance of theelder godKnull.[21]\nFive heirs originating from three different clans battled for the dominant position:\nSnarkwar was monitored byS.W.O.R.D., who believed the war could destabilize the galactic peace (they also monitored the enigmatic deaths of whole planets).[22]\nRather than a fixed power base, Djagyar used a guerrilla fleet always on the move, thus making it hard to locate. Kuga attempted to conquerOrtuaa, a peaceful world with vast mineral resources and close to a strategic binary wormhole, not knowing that Knull had already destroyed that world. Her brother Djagyar seized the opportunity to outflank her, causing severe losses to her forces, forcing her into retreat and hiding whilst becoming the most likely successor to Stote. Kuga attempted to rebuild her forces, though presumably it was a vain effort as her warriors were deserting for stronger armies such as Djagyar's.\nMeanwhile, Wezel was besieged at the edge ofUtopian Kree space, and attempted negotiation with theSupremorfor safe passage.\nAsEarthfell to Knull, S.W.O.R.D. andKrakoanagentManifoldmet with Djagyar in his flagship in deep space, to offer him mutant powers in exchange for the help of his fleet (which wasn't required to protect worlds) against Knull, a proposal which was refused by Djagyar, who considered Knull his benefactor, as he destroyed his rivals' worlds and did not impact him whatsoever due to his nomadic strategy. Djagyar was assassinated seconds after Manifold's departure.[18]\nWanting to cause universe-wide chaos, theReckoningprovided the Zn'rx with theWatchers' technology to attack other alien civilizations.[23]\nThe Zn'rx appear to be oviparous.[24]\nScannerwas amutantof his race,[25]with the power of being able to track any thing with unerring accuracy.[1]\nThe race survived in one way or another up through the31st Century. Amutantof the Zn'rx,[25]Scannerwas gifted with greater than normal powers of awareness. He was part of the mercenary groupForce(who opposed at times theGuardians of the Galaxy).[24]\nInEarth-5631, the Zn'rx were one of several alien species who at some point in history discovered the secret of theanti-matterformula, and tried to use it to make a weapon: TheAnnihilator. However, their attempt to harness this power resulted in their planet being destroyed. Along with the other races that lost their planets this way, including theKymellians, they forged the remains of their world intoPatchworld.[26]\nThe Zn'rx seen so far are all children and subjects ofQueen Maraud. It is unknown if there are any other queens or clans like in theEarth-616continuity. All Zn'rx are indoctrinated from a young age to have an undying loyalty for their queen and to hate all other races. One of the primary weaknesses of the species is their total lack of imagination; they cannot come up with ideas of their own and thus steal or copy all their technology from other species. Even their ship looks like it was put together from different parts of various other ships.[27]This same lack of imagination also rendered them unable to learn from the mistake that cost them their planet. As such, they kept seeking ways to recreate the Annihilator.[26]For this purpose, they abductedDr. James Powerand his wife, but they were stopped when Dr. Powers'four kidsreceived superpowers from the KymellianAelfyre Whitemaneand intervened. In the process, Power Pack also managed to turn Maraud into a pacifist by erasing her memory and then using the same indoctrination method used to teach young Zn'rx to make her believe all Zn'rx are peaceful.[28]This apparently stopped the threat of the Zn'rx, however some time later it was revealed at least some Zn'rx were still at large.[29]\nIn theHumorverse, theSnarfs(the direct counterpart of the Snarks) tried to conquer Earth - but theBower BratsconvincedGalactapusto eat the Snarfs as if they were frog's legs.[30]\nThe so-calledSpace Snarks, apparently a different species, were kept by theWatchersas companion animals. The young WatcherLavnicfound that they were quite interesting and hoped that his babysitterUatuhad one.[31]\nInEarth-22455, the Zn'rx abandoned their attempts to capturePower Packor attackEarthat some point after their first defeat at the hands of the young heroes. That changed when years later,Julieaccidentally contacted them, renewing their interest in Earth. To fight off the threat, Julie reunited her siblings, who had all gone their separate ways, to once more become Power Pack.[32]\nEmpire. Succession determined by civil war between the many princes, descendants of the previous emperor.\nA major concept of the Zn'rx society is theZn'rx War of Succession, colloquially named \"Snarkwar\".\nWhen a Zn'rx monarch dies, his heirs instantly know of it (so far, xenobiology hasn't explained exactly how), and are immediately affected by a violent[18]urge to claim the alpha position at any cost by any means, with no regards to collateral victims,[21][18]using any weapon found, bought, or stolen,[21]to the extent of literally claiming other beings' powers (supernatural, sorcery,Inhuman) as their own. They called such as powers \"inborn\"[17]or \"in-built\"[18]\"weapons\" or \"talents\".\nA faction initiating the Snarkwar was seemingly completely destroyed if not victorious.[17]Kl'rt, the Super-Skrull, considered that in comparison with the Snarks, theKree/Skrullseemed restrained (though those were now able to weaponize suns into astro-nuclear weapons).[20]\nPrince Hyinarreacting to the appearance of hisshipuncloaked onCentauri-IV\nDespite the extreme consequences for who got in the way of the Snarkwar,[21]at least some factions remained stealthy in their powers-stealing operations to avoid intergalactic incidents.[34]\nIn spite of their war-like nature and ruined reputation,[2]the Snarks were involved in diplomatic relations with others cultures:\nThe Zn'rx issued bounties.[35]\nWar-like. They conquer and take what they want.[39]Planets that were inhabited by superpowered beings were known to the Zn'rx as Weaponworlds, planning to use them for their own accord.[9]The Zn'rx would attempt to steal these beings' powers which may have been due to an inferiority complex.[39]\nBecause the Zn'rx prioritized war culture, the species lacked a proper education system as children were expected to grow to become warriors. However, princessDjinna, who abhorred fights, was allowed to attend the Intergalactic Academy of Science.[40]\nAlternate realities:"

Using theAnti-Magnetic Inverter,Spider-Manwas able to counteract the magnetic power that the Vulture harnessed for his wings, damaging them and causing the Vulture to spiral to Earth was arrested.[1]\nIn prison, the Vulture spent his time secretly smuggling parts from the prison machine shop into his cell, so that he could recreate his flying technology, this time correcting the flaw which caused his defeat last time: by switching the magnetic poles, the wings wouldn't be affected by the anti-magnetic inverter anymore.[2]\nWhen he joined theSinister Six, theVultureused his wings to deliver a message toJ. Jonah Jameson, telling him thatBetty Branthad been captured and thatSpider-Manhad to go toStark Electric Plantin order to save her. The Vulture was eventually defeated by Spidey and ended up in prison with the rest of the Sinister Six.[3]\nBlackie Drago dons the Vulture suit in mid-air\nBefore Adrian Toomes seemingly died in jail, following an accident, he told his cellmateBlackie Dragothe location of a spare set of Vulture wings. Once he learned of their location, Drago revealed that the \"accident\" was planned in the hopes that Toomes would reveal the location of the wings, so that once Drago got out of prison, he could use the technology for his own personal gain. That night, Drago managed to sneak out of the prison, and found Toomes' spare set of wings: hidden in a hiding place near the prison. Drago managed to escape before the guards could capture him, mastering how to use the wings in moments and flying away.[4]\nHe used the Vulture's wings against Spider-Man andKraven the Hunter, but he was eventually defeated by Spidey at theExhibition Hall.[5]Back in Toomes' possession when he was hired by theKingpinto killRaymond Trask, the wings were used to fly away after the failed assassination attempt, before the Vulture was lifted byDoctor Octopusin hisHover Jet.[6]\nThe Vulture flapped again his wings to deploySandmantoGovernors Islandin order to steal a prototype amphibious tank, fending off Spider-Man.[7]The Vulture then joined the Sinister Six in the assault against theCordcospace launch facility, fighting Spider-Man again.[8]\nAs soon as he understood Doc Ock's real plan to infect the ozone layer with a drug that causes extreme convulsions in cocaine users, in order to rule the world alone in exchange for the burundite antidote for the rich and powerful addicts, the Vulture flew away, vowing revenge on the traitor.[9]\nThe original vulture wings resulted from Toomes' mastery of electromagnetic force, but he nevertheless managed to break out fromRyker's Islandonly with a pair of wings tinkered together from sheets and bed slats.[10]\nAfter he absorbed Spider-Man's lifeforce and returned young, the Vulture headed to his hideout and created a new and improved electromagnetic costume.[11]When he was arrested again inNew Jersey, the police seized his new pair of wings.[12]When the Vulture met theOwlinManhattan, he seemed to have recovered his new pair of wings.[13]\nThe Vulture was then defeated byDaredevilinBrooklyn, and supposedly arrested by thepolice.[14]A while later, the Vulture was surprised by theScarlet Spider, who tried to trap his wings with impact webbing, but the villain easily freed himself and flew away.[15]\nAfter Spider-Man defeated the Sinister Six in aNassau Countytop-secret facility whereDoctor Octopus' Tentacleswere stored, the Vulture managed to escape capture by flying away.[16]The Vulture then savedHobgoblinwhen he was thrown off a rooftop by a collapsing water tower.[17]\nAs the de-aging effect was fading away, the Vulture used his wings to ambush his victims.[18]A short time later, he flew again to get revenge on the newProwler.[19]The Vulture sneaked into Prowler's apartment, although he was out of his element, unable to maneuver in such a confined area.[20]\nAdrian gave a pair of red wings to his granddaughter,Tiana Toomes, which she used to become the superheroStarling.[21]"

Though Dargo was skeptical, feeling the people should depend on themselves and not an old legend to gain their freedom, he and his girlfriendSallastill attended a secret ceremony on September 4th, 2587 AD where cultists tried to pick up  Mjolnir. Having noticed the cult, and wishing to prevent them from restoring his extradimensionally exiled step-brother,Lokiallied himself with the Corp and sent minions to attack the meeting; during the assault Dargo grabbed Mjolnir and, judged worthy, was transformed into an avatar of Thor. When even his rock trollTyrus the Terribleproved unable to defeat Dargo, an angry Loki destroyed Corp Central out of pique, ending their rule. Sensing Mjolnir being pulled towards the true Thor, Dargo sent it to him through a dimensional portal.[1]\nSome time later, for reasons unknown to Dargo, Mjolnir returned to him, and he resumed being Thor, battling the likes of Demonstaff and briefly being used as a pawn against Earth-616's Fantastic Four by Zarrko the Tomorrow Man. Dargo and Salla had married by April 2591, when Dargo encountered Earth-691's time-traveling Guardians of the Galaxy and helped them defeat the Korvac-empowered Varley.[2]\nA few months later, in September of that same year, he was duped by Zarrko into traveling back in time to Earth-616 to attack Eric Masterson, then Thor's modern-day avatar, whom Zarrko claimed had stolen Thor's hammer and thus been responsible for it being lost until Dargo's era; Dargo fought both Eric and Stellaris before Beta Ray Bill, another \"Thor\" intervened, and convinced Dargo of Zarrko's deception. Zarrko intended to siphon the combined energy from Eric and Dargo's hammers to power his Radical Time Stabilizer and collapse the multiverse into a single timeline, but together the Thors overcame Zarrko and his time-displaced allies, before Dargo returned to his own timeline.[3]\nDargo possesses all the powers of Thor.\nWeather Control: Control over the base elements of a storm, ie. rain, wind, thunder and lightning. He can create raging electrical storms complete with thunder, lightning, hurricane-force winds, tornadoes and torrential rains. He can also create any of these phenomena individually. Another aspect of this power allows him to stop any of these weather conditions as well. The powers are shown as being channeled through Mjolnir.\nSuperhuman Speed: The superhuman ability to move at speeds up to 115 miles per hour. Via Mjolnir, he can fly at lightspeed.\nSuperhuman Stamina: A highly efficient musculature produces almost no fatigue toxins, granting him almost limitless stamina in all physical activities.\nSuperhuman Durability: His body is able to withstand extreme temperatures and pressures, and virtually all toxins, corrosives, punctures, and concussions without sustaining injury. His flesh and bones are several times denser than a human's."

But after receiving these powers, the four kids were branded mutants by townsfolk, and the violence that followed cost the pack their parents' lives.[citation needed]\nthe children stayed together for a while but evenually grew apart as they got older. Julie ended up working for the SETI project in New Mexico, attempting to contact her old friends in the Kymellians. Unfortunately, she managed to accidentally contact the Snark race by mistake, who had always attempted to steal the dangerous power source developed by her father.[citation needed]\nJulie sought and warned her siblings of the impending Snark threat. She found Katie in Boston working in a cafe, now a 25 year old and heavily tattooed; Jack in San Francisco, now a 28 year old junkie in and out of rehab unable to control his soild form; and finally her older brother Alex in south Carolina, as a 32 year old construction foreman with a family of his own.[citation needed]"
