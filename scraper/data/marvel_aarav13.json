The two seem to have at least a minor addiction to the social networking site Facebook, and have mentioned it on several occasions. They fight with a combination of Mexican wrestling moves, as well as firearms ranging from machine guns to RPGs.[1]\nDuring real live fights they will tag each other in and out of battle as if they were in a wrestling ring, much to the surprise ofMoon Knight, one of their first superhero opponents. When they were double-crossed by their employer, they decided to help Moon Knight by guardingCarmen Alcantara, the woman he was protecting from her father. While Moon Knight was battling her father, they stole Alcantara's hoard of cash and gave enough to Moon Knight to allow him to restart his mission in the States.[2]"

Central,North Wales,United KingdomCreators and AppearancesCreatorsJohn Freeman,Dave TaylorFirstGene Dogs#1(August, 1993)\nThe Gene Dogs is an elite team of operatives fromS.T.O.R.M., a pan-European defense and counter-terrorist organization. The original Gene Dogs, consisting ofCat,Howitzer,Kestrel,Pacer,TyrandPanther, were initially members of Team Omega, an esteemed counter-terrorist squad under the command ofLars Dinkelbach. During a mission in theCongo, the team fell into an ambush by an unidentified creature, resulting in severe injuries. While Dinkelbach managed to escape unscathed, the creature carried an artificial virus that hindered the healing of the team's wounds. To save their lives, Dr. Samuel Merrick utilized his Gene Matching Device to mutate them. Each member underwent gene-splicing with different animals, granting them unique abilities. Additionally, they receivedGene-Chips, bio-wetware computer chips implanted in their cerebral cortex to further enhance their capabilities. However, the transformation destabilized their genetic structures, necessitating regular treatments from Merrick for survival. The Gene Dogs now serve as field operatives for the covert government organization, S.T.O.R.M.[1]\nOne year following their mutation, the Gene Dogs were assigned the task of recovering the Gene Scanner, a coveted technology targeted by Otomo, who dispatched his agents, theQ7 Strike Force, to retrieve it. The Gene Dogs successfully fended off the Strike Force, securing the Scanner. Tragically, Panther fell victim to Banzai's assault during the confrontation. S.T.O.R.M., in response, temporarily replaced Panther with Cat. Unbeknownst to Otomo, Mys-Tech had devised the Gene Scanner as a deceptive weapon, disguising it as a device with potent mutagenic capabilities. Mys-Tech manipulated Otomo into stealing the Scanner. They then employed Hurricane to retrieve it, subsequently leaking information to the Strike Force, who ambushed and captured both Hurricane and the Scanner. Eventually, the Gene Dogs formed an alliance with the Strike Force to eliminate the Scanner upon discovering its true nature as a bomb. During their mission, they learned that Panther had covertly worked as a Mys-Tech agent. Pursuing a false lead provided by Panther, they engaged in a confrontation with the group Genetix. Otomo and the Strike Force managed to escape, while Hurricane was once again imprisoned.[2]"

Wild Pack was mostly contracted toMr. Tolliver, an arms dealer and used Cable's orbiting space station,Graymalkin, as a means of teleporting, or \"body sliding\", in and out of situations. After a conflict withSilver Sable(who already had a group called the Wild Pack), the junior member of the team,Kanesuggested the name Six Pack, while drinking a beer. On a mission inAfghanistan, Six Pack learned thatStryfe, a former enemy of Cable's, was in charge of Mr. Tolliver's opium routes and they were contracted to take out theSovietarmored carriers that were in this route's way.  After a brief battle, Stryfe andA.D.A.M. Unit Zeroteleported away.  Cable scrapped the mission, much to the disliking of the team.  Angry, Mr. Tolliver sent agents to kill Six Pack, but they were defeated.  On another mission, Six Pack invaded aHydraresearch facility in search of a stolen component.  Once inside,Hammeraccidentally triggered a fail-safe andBaron von Strucker'simage appeared everywhere threatening to kill Six Pack, but they quickly retrieved the device and body slid out.  Six Pack later found-out that they were working forA.I.M..  Feeling used, Six Pack decided to go after Stryfe in Uruguay.  After entering an underground bunker, Six Pack battled their way into a control room, where Hammer began to download secret information from Stryfe onto a CD.  While waiting for the disk to finish downloading, Stryfe teleported behind Kane and grabbed his neck, demanding Hammer to give him the CD.  Before Hammer could give Stryfe the CD, Cable shot him from behind.  Stryfe grabbed the disk telekinetically and set-off a self-destruct on the bunker.  Cable teleported away, leaving Six Pack to fend for themselves. Under the rubble, Hammer became paralyzed from the neck down and Kane's arms and legs were severed.\nWhile searching forX-Force,DominofoundGrizzlyand Hammer and, at the same time, Kane, Cable, andG.W.

The men andYuriko Oyamawere converted into cyborgs, becoming the first of the Reavers.[3]\nFirst appearance of the Reavers\nThe original Reavers, which includedBonebreaker,Pretty BoyandSkullbusterset up operations inCooterman's CreekinAustralia, and worked with a local aboriginal man namedGateway. He was a Mutant who could teleport people anywhere across the planet. They used him and their new found upgrades to rob a banks across the world. On one outing toSingaporethey kidnappedJessán Hoan, which lead to theX-Mencoming to her rescue. The X-Men took down the Reavers' operations. In the confusion, Bonebreaker, Skullbuster and Pretty Boy managed to get away and ordered Gateway to teleport them away, telling the Aboriginal that if he does so then his debt to them is paid.[4]\nThe Reavers, officially led byDonald Pierceand working withLady Deathstrike, plotted revenge on the X-Men. They were unaware that they were being watched byNannyand theOrphan-Maker, who wanted the X-Men for themselves.[5]The Reavers practiced their coming attack on the X-Men by beating robot versions of the team. Nanny and the Orphan Maker, knowing of the coming deadly conflict with the Reavers kidnapped the X-Men.[6]They tried to track the X-Men unaware they had been transported to theSavage Land.[7]They captured Wolverine and hung him on a wooden X and tortured him. But later the town came under the fury of a powerful storm that seems to be encircling the whole globe. While the Reavers wait out the tempest inside, Jubilee freed Wolverine and the two escaped.[8]\nThe Reavers found the crucifix empty and searched the base for the escaped Logan. Jubilee and Wolverine attempted to flee the complex before being hunted by the Reavers' cyborg hounds.[9]They escaped from the Reavers base, but the cyborgs pinpointedMuir IslandinScotlandas their most probable destination and planned to invade the island.[10]The two X-Men held off the Reavers the best they could.[11]Freedom Forcearrived as back up to help stop the Reavers attack, but with disastrous consequences to the team:Avalanchewas wounded by Lady Deathstrike and Pierce killedStonewall. Meanwhile Destiny Wass murdered in cold blood by Legion, who also snuffed out Pyro's flame attack at a critical moment in the fight.Forgeturned the battle against the Reavers with a new sniper rifle that was capable of destroying Pierce's cyborgs.Skullbusterwas killed, but the others Reavers escaped.[12]\nIn anAthens,Greece, hospital, Donald Pierce made the horribly injuredCylla Markhaman offer she could not refuse.[13]In California, the Reavers destroyed a facility owned by Emma Frost, the Hellfire Club's White Queen. They intended to destroy as much property of Emma's as they have to, until they finally caught up with her.[14]\nWhenMicrochiptapped into the Reavers computer system, He stole plans to build a combat robot dubbed the \"Dalek\". The group found the hack and decided to seek revenge by trashing thePunisher's safe house and then went after Microchip and Castle.[15]Microchip created thePunisher's Exo-Armorto level the playing the field for Castle against the Reavers.[16]\nRoguewas spat out from theSiege Perilousto land in the former X-Men base in Australia only to learn it had become the HQ of the Reavers. Surprisingly,Carol Danvershad body of her own again and, while she fought the Reavers, Rogue absorbed Gateway's powers long enough to teleport herself and Carol away.[17]\nLady DeathStriketook control of the Reavers and used them to hunt down Wolverine.[18]\nA few years later, a member of theUpstarts,Trevor Fitzroy, sentSentinelsto destroy the Reavers because they were a threat to mutants and Pierce (as the Hellfire Club's former White King) was worth a lot of points in the deadly game the Upstarts played. Of the Reavers, only Lady Deathstrike andCyllaescaped the Sentinels and it appeared that Pierce had been destroyed.[19]Wolverine went to investigate and found the rest of the Reavers were completely wiped out.[20]\nLady Deathstrike tried to hunt down Logan again in order to extract his Adamantium-laced bones, completely unaware that Logan no longer possessed them since Magneto ripped the unbreakable metal from his body a short time ago. When she learned the truth she reluctantly left in peace.[21]\nThe Reavers were sent to kill Wolverine and the Punisher. The two teamed up and struck back the cybernetic enforcers.[22]\nThey battled theX-Treme X-Menwith a new female;Skullbuster[23]\nAn angry young man namedJosh Foleyjoined the Reavers at the behest of his then best friend, Duncan. WhenCerebradetected a mutant in the area,Dani MoonstarandKarmawere sent to investigate. Meanwhile, the Reavers engaged a group of students from Xavier's in a fight, and Josh discovered he was a healer by healing one of his fellow Reavers. By knocking him out, he was able to hide this for a short time until he felt compelled to heal the mortally-injuredLaurie Collins. Laurie developed a crush on him as a result. When the Reavers discovered Josh was a mutant with healing powers, they rejected him and retreated. Angrily rejecting Moonstar's offer to go to the X-Mansion, he went home, to find his fellow Reavers waiting for him, where they delivered a severe beating, and when his parents discovered he was a mutant, they disowned him.[24]With nowhere else to go, Josh reluctantly went to theXavier Institute. He joined their trainee team theNew Mutants[25]The Reavers came for revenge on Josh but were unsuccessful and he remained at the institute.[26]\nLady DeathStrikemade an oath to the ReverendWilliam Stryker, creator of thePurifiers. She promised to him that in the mutant's darkest hours she would help his Purifiers. She recreated the Reavers.[27]They caught up withCable, just in time for theX-Forceto attack.[28]Lady Deathstrike took onX-23and was seemingly killed. The other Reavers died, but not without killingCalibanfirst.[29]\nAfter being recomposed by Donald Pierce and gathered by Deathstrike, the Reavers assaultedUtopia, before being defeated byX-Force.[30]\nThe Reavers were one one of the many enforcer groups working for theDescendants. Father used the Reavers as enforcers when the attacked theUnited Nations Headquarters.[31]\nCable,Hope, andX-Forcewent on a mission to the Reavers base to stop them from any future attacks on Mutants.[32]\nEvan Sabahnur, the young clone ofApocalypse, was trying to rob a bank when he was interrupted by the Reavers. He noticed a woman was having a heart attack, and used his powers to crush the Reavers with a giant statue of a cat, then rushed the woman to hospital.[33]\nAfter rumors of the return of the recently deceased Wolverine started spreading, the Reavers, lead by Deathstrike, began tracking him down. Unknown to them this was anolder versionof Logan, and the present one was still dead.[34]They eventually found him in the isolated town ofKillhorn Falls, Canada, where Logan was attempting to live a peaceful life.[35]Deathstrike and the Reavers attacked the town, massacring it's inhabitants as revenge against Wolverine. At the end, Logan managed to kill all the Reavers except Deathstrike, who escaped after being seriously injured.[36]\nA contingent of the Reavers led by a recently resurfaced Donald Pierce came to the burial sight where the X-Men left the molten remains of Logan's body. Bonebreaker mockingly chided the adamantium statue while pricking his finger on it's extended claws, they ended up tripping a silent alarm put in place by the crypt holder's friends in the event someone tried to desecrate it.\nA firefight would break out between the X-Men's heavy hitters and the decadent remnants of the bionic mutant killers. Pierce, having taken on the job due to the all time lows he and his crew had hit in the following years, was being paid by an unknown buyer to excavate the fallen Canadian's remains for a handsome sum of money. The decayed cyborgs needed this score desperately. While the rest of their team worked interference between them and their mark, Pierce and Cylla got to work on cracking that dense slag shell surrounding their prize. Cylla had been upgraded with a Molecular Rearranger in order to break the unbreakable alloy surrounding their prize. Despite this, the process that took a lot of time. When they finally succeeded however, the two were disappointed to find Logan's body was no longer there.\nSome time prior to their attempted grave robbery, Kitty had opted to remove Logan from the metallic outer layer he'd been trapped in, eventually giving him a proper burial within another undisclosed location, known only to a select few.[37]\nThe Reavers later reappeared in service of the secretly reinstatedO.N.Eorganization. Where Donald Pierce and his cyber-mercs were deposited into the care of General Robert Callahan after the X-Men left them withAlpha Flight; whom, not being able to do much with them in the first place, left them at the doorstep of the current director of which.[38]\nThey were tasked by their new handler to incarcerateMiss Sinisterin exchange for some bodily refits, upgrades and their freedom.[39]When they completed the task however, the crooked commanding officer revealed he'd rigged their refurbished bionics to short circuit in case they became unruly. Callahan opting to take Pierce and Cylla back to base with them in order to modify their mutant hunting equipment, while ordering the extermination of the rest afterward.[38]\nAfter some time on the run from O.N.E. a contingent of Reavers attackedHankand a visitingAlex Summersat the university the former taught at.[40]Beast would later examine the remains of one of their number to find a list mutant targets given to them by their former employers,[40]while Havok would come clean that the person they were hunting in the first place, was him.\nWith no other options available to them, Alexander accompanied byWarpathwent to the remaining debilitated cyborg mutant killers for aid in rescuing their own. In exchange for the program data hidden within Alex himself, The Reavers found themselves briefly forced to ally with the X-Men to rescue their comrades from a shared enemy.[41]Allegiances which quickly turned sideways as the Reavers predictably betrayed their X ally's the second they deciphered thesecreted codestored in Alex's brain.[42]The same nanobionic code they were fighting with Callahan to ascertain a piece of technoforming program that enabled any mechanical apparatus to override and assimilate any kind of mechanical or cybernetic operational system; be it biological, inorganic, purely motorized, or even Artificial Intelligence.\nWith this new upgrade in tow, the Reavers believed they had killed the X-Men. Eventually they moved on to attack the Xavier Mansion with their newly acquiredsentinel bodies. They were eventually stopped by the still-alive X-Men and were once again incarcerated by O.N.E. shortly afterwards.[43]\nIn the wake of the establishment of the new mutant nation-state of Krakoa, the anti-mutant cabalXENOdeployed a group of artificially-grown and biologically-augmented Reavers to infiltrate Krakoa and assassinateProfessor X. They were successful.[44]However, Xavier would later resurrected by theFive[45]\nLikewise, Donald Pierce threw his lot, and resources, in with an all new anti-mutant gentlemen's club heralded asHomines Verendi.[46]Max Frankensteintook a plethora of ex-military, special forces along with other ne'er-do-well mercenary figures, all of whom that met with catastrophic infraction while battling mutants, into service under Verendi's banner for a personal project.[47]\nHe took these underlings of one bigoted faction or another unto his testing labs, transforming these dregs into a biomechanical augment private army to act as the hate group's personal strikeforce against Krakoa's humanitarian aid set up in the impoverished sections of Madripoor.[48]"

After learning of Diamondback and Cap's relationship, the Society's new leader,King Cobra, had Diamondback kidnapped and placed on trial, fearing that she would reveal the group's secrets to the Captain. Diamondback was found guilty by the majority of her fellow Serpents, and sentenced to execution. Black Mamba and Asp objected, but were overruled by King Cobra. To save Diamondback, Black Mamba and Asp called in a favor from their former leader, Sidewinder (who was also Black Mamba's ex-boyfriend), and he rescued Diamondback. However, in retaliation, King Cobra captured the Asp and Black Mamba. Diamondback then hired the mercenaryPaladinto help her free the pair. Together, with Captain America, and Paladin, the five combined to defeat the Serpent Society.\nFearing retaliation from the Society, Diamondback suggested they form their own group, B.A.D. Girls, Inc., the \"B\", \"A\", and \"D\" being the initials of their combined codenames. Later, the remaining Serpent Society members captured Diamondback, however,M.O.D.A.M.intervened and kidnapped their former teammateAnacondaand all three B.A.D Girls to enlist them forSuperia's army ofFemizons. While on Superia's cruise ship, Asp and Mamba befriended Zambian criminal javelin expertImpala, while Diamondback was attacked and almost killed by her old rivalSnapdragon. Traumatized, Diamondback decided to quit adventuring, and the team were rescued by Captain America and Paladin who once again joined forces with them to defeat Superia and her Femizons. After the battle, Captain America offered to clear their names, but the girls declined. When Mamba pulled the image of Diamondback's greatest fear from her, which was Snapdragon, Diamondback quit the group in anger. Black Mamba and Asp decided to investigate, seeking out Snapdragon.\nIn New York'sBar With No Name, the pair were attacked byBattleaxe,Steel Wind, andGolddigger, who were seeking the bounty Superia had placed on their heads. Impala came to their rescue and joined B.A.D. Girls Inc.,replacing Diamondback.\nThe new trio briefly foughtSersian Avenger when stealing aSerpent Saucerfrom the Society's old headquarters, and eventually tracked Superia and Snapdragon to anA.I.M.weapons exposition inBoca Caliente. However, when Snapdragon was killed by Diamondback, the threesome lost their immediate goal, and the group eventually dissolved.\nDiamondback regained her confidence and she contacted her friends and their group remained intermittently active. Diamondback worked forS.H.I.E.L.D., while the Asp and Black Mamba both freelanced. Mamba briefly worked forJustine Hammeragainst theThunderbolts.\nSome time later, Asp and Mamba rejoined the Serpent Society when they were hunting what King Cobra believed to be Diamondback, but who turned out to be a LMD. The founding B.A.D. Girls later reunited whenCableanonymously hired them to steal a new computer hard drive from the Dominus Corporation. After battlingDeadpoolfor the technology, they determined that it had already been stolen byCat, and confronted him in Hong Kong.

As the Demons actions become more violent over time, Sable International held various operations in the city, setting up bases and various outposts on avenues and alleys, looking for potential citizens who may have been corrupted by the Demons. When became clear thatDr. Morgan Michaelswas the one in possession of theDevil's Breath, a bioweapon that the Demons were looking for, Sable International sends a team to escort him safely out of town, only for the escort team to be completly obliterated, and Dr. Michaels captured. This puts Sable on bad terms with Norman, who threatens to suspend her activities on the city. The sample was later recovered thanks to the intervention ofSpider-ManandMary Jane Watson. When theDevil's Breathwas released intoNew York CitybyDoctor Octopus, Norman Osborn blamed Spider-Man for the incident, making him a priority target for the company, and gives Sable International permission to enact martial law, as they proceed to place Manhattan under quarantine.\nWhen Silver Sable left New York City, she stated that she owned the company, but didn't controlled her mercenaries, who stayed behind in the city, as Norman was still paying them.\nAfter the Devil's Breath was erradicated, Sable International was driven out New York by Spider-Man, who managed to end all of their operations, as they were attacking and harming civilians with no prupose."

In the final battle, Vulture Noir gains teleportation powers, but is defeated.\n2099:Spider-Man 2099 finds the next fragment in the hands of theScorpion 2099, who was originally his half-brother Kron Stone.

All the while, Juggernaut doesn't even know he has the fragment, and Spider-Man chases after him while attempting to preventSilver Sablefrom blasting Juggernaut before he gets the tablet. When Juggernaut finds out that the tablet's on his shoes in the final battle, he becomes stronger, but is easily defeated because the fragment tangles with the mystic ruby that originally gave him his powers, making him vulnerable.\nNoir:When Hammerhead Noir and Vulture Noir are defeated,Goblin Noiruses the fragment in his possession to become a large, hulking monster reminiscent ofhis Ultimate counterpart. After a long battle, Spider-Man Noir defeats him and retrieves the final fragment in his dimension.\n2099:After Spider-Man 2099 defeated Hobgoblin 2099 and Scorpion 2099 , the final fragment in 2099 is in the clutches of Doctor Octopus 2099.

Ultimate Carnage goes on a rampage, killing S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents and turning them into corrupted zombies, and some of them are slowly turn into mini-Carnage spawns. Spider-Man defeats Carnage with the help of the remaining agents with their reprogrammedSpider-Slayersas the Ultimate Spidey's allies, and retrieves the final fragment.\nSpider-Man needs to find the other way before Mysterio gets it without killing Madame Web. It is revealed that the fragment can assemble itself, leaving the four realities ripped under Mysterio's control as a god. It is up to the four Spider-Men (Amazing, Ultimate, Noir and 2099) to save all reality.\nAfter the Tablet of Order and Chaos is reassembled, Mysterio uses it to become a powerful god-like being. He then plans to destroy the multiverse and remake it in his own image. One by one, each Spider-Man defeats Mysterio and they retrieve the Tablet. After every other Spider-Man returns to their own respective universe, the multiverse is repaired and the mainstream Spider-Man sends Mysterio to jail.\nThe credits show every Spider-Man villain in the game in humorous situations. Kraven has a bandaged head and fails to catch a rabbit. The Sandman is imprisoned in an hourglass. Juggernaut has been tranquilized by Silver Sable and has a picture taken, much like hunters after capturing their prey. Hammerhead Noir is having his guns tied to his arms by his henchmen. The Vulture Noir is shown in a cage with makeup and people laughing at him. The Goblin Noir is initially stuck in his fragment form and shown wearing a sailor hat and giving balloons to children, one of which points and laughs at him at the re-opened carnival. Hobgoblin 2099 forms a team of Multi-Coloured Goblins, Scorpion 2099 is in prison cutting colored paper into different shapes with the other prisoners and Doctor Octopus 2099 is shown acting like a mother to her now childlike robot duplicates of Hobgoblin and Scorpion. Before the Ultimate Electro and Deadpool were taken to the S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Ultimate Electro is initially stuck in his Full Power Form and shown hiding behind a bush (referencing Ultimate Spider-Man's jabs about him not wearing pants [or underpants or any under clothing]) and Ultimate Deadpool is revealed to be stranded on a deserted island, which is far away, meaning it will be a long time before he is found by S.H.I.E.L.D. Carnage is shown having a photo taken with his minions, the corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and the Spider-Slayer 1.0 robots, one of them giving him bunny ears. Mysterio is shown feeding goldfish, an allusion to how his helmet resembles a fishbowl.\nIn the mid-credits,Spider-Hamvisits Madame Web, unaware that the multiverse has already been saved as he asks \"So, what I miss\"? Madame Web quotes \"What the...\"\nAll four Spider-Men play differently. Amazing Spider-Man can use his webbing to beat up his opponents. Spider-Man Noir defeats his enemies by hiding in the shadows and sneaking up on his enemies with stealth, all the while avoiding being seen. Spider-Man 2099 possesses accelerated vision, which enables him to slow down time around him and avoid fast-moving attacks and obstacles. Ultimate Spider-Man uses the symbiote to attack his enemies with tendrils. He also has a rage meter which, once activated, causes him to just go crazy and beat up every criminal that comes in his path. The only powers all four Spider-Men appear to possess are Spider-Sense, wall-crawling, and using their webbing to swing around and to zip to platforms.\nDS VERSION:While still featuring some of the main plot elements of the console version(and much of the dialogue similar to that in the console version), the DS version is drastically different. The most obvious difference from the console version is that Ultimate Spider-Man is omitted, and thus no characters from the Ultimate universe play a part in the story.\nAmazing- Spider-Man chases Mysterio and fights him. When Mysterio nears defeat, he lifts up the Tablet of Order and Chaos to shield himself from Spider-Man's attacks. Spider-Man tries to use his webbing to pull the Tablet away, but accidentally breaks it, opening interdimensional rifts between the Mainstream, Noir, and 2099 universes. He is told by Madame Web to give the fragment left behind to Spider-Man Noir.Noir- Spider-Man Noir stops a museum heist and defeats his world's version ofBoomerang Noirto receive the fragment. He passes it on to Spider-Man 2099.2099- Spider-Man retrieves the first Tablet fragment in his world from theVultureand then escapes Alchemax agents in order to pass the fragment on to the Amazing Spider-Man.\nAmazing- Spider-Man finds the first tablet fragment of his world used by theTinkererto power a robot-making machine. After destroying Tinkerer's machine, Spider-Man retrieves the fragment and passes it on to Spider-Man Noir, but not before the Tinkerer gloats that he has sold an army of his robots toElectro.Noir- Spider-Man Noir finds the last tablet in his world in the hands ofCalypso Noir, who uses the fragment to raise an army of zombies, and also plans to use it to resurrect this world's version ofKraven Noir, who was killed when infected by the same spiders that gave Peter Parker his powers. Spider-Man defeats Calypso and gives the fragment to Spider-Man 2099.2099- The last fragment that ended up in the 2099 universe is revealed to be in the possession ofSilvermane 2099, who is actually the original Silvermane from the Amazing universe, having survived into the near end of the 21st century due to being a cyborg. He plans to use the fragment to gain true immortality, but Spider-Man defeats him and gives the fragment to Amazing Spider-Man.\nAmazing- Spider-Man finds the last tablet fragment in the hands of Electro. Spider-Man defeats him and reassembles the Tablet, but Mysterio uses it to become all-powerful. Fortunately, Spider-Man manages to defeat Mysterio and save all of every existing reality.\nNote: All the actors that voice the Spider-Men have voiced Spider-Man for television before.

During their mercenary missions they often bicker amongst each other like young siblings often do. The two seem to have at least a minor addiction to the social networking site Facebook, and have mentioned it on several occasions. They fight with a combination of Mexican wrestling moves, as well as firearms ranging from machine guns to RPGs.[1]\nDuring real live fights they will tag each other in and out of battle as if they were in a wrestling ring, much to the surprise ofMoon Knight, one of their first superhero opponents. When they were double-crossed by their employer, they decided to help Moon Knight by guardingCarmen Alcantara, the woman he was protecting from her father. While Moon Knight was battling her father, they stole Alcantara's hoard of cash and gave enough to Moon Knight to allow him to restart his mission in the States.[2]"

He uses plastique explosives to tear a hole in the wall and set her free. When Carmen learns that it was her father who hired Lockley to free her, she becomes extremely frightened.

Central,North Wales,United KingdomCreators and AppearancesCreatorsJohn Freeman,Dave TaylorFirstGene Dogs#1(August, 1993)\nThe Gene Dogs is an elite team of operatives fromS.T.O.R.M., a pan-European defense and counter-terrorist organization. The original Gene Dogs, consisting ofCat,Howitzer,Kestrel,Pacer,TyrandPanther, were initially members of Team Omega, an esteemed counter-terrorist squad under the command ofLars Dinkelbach. During a mission in theCongo, the team fell into an ambush by an unidentified creature, resulting in severe injuries. While Dinkelbach managed to escape unscathed, the creature carried an artificial virus that hindered the healing of the team's wounds. To save their lives, Dr. Samuel Merrick utilized his Gene Matching Device to mutate them. Each member underwent gene-splicing with different animals, granting them unique abilities. Additionally, they receivedGene-Chips, bio-wetware computer chips implanted in their cerebral cortex to further enhance their capabilities. However, the transformation destabilized their genetic structures, necessitating regular treatments from Merrick for survival. The Gene Dogs now serve as field operatives for the covert government organization, S.T.O.R.M.[1]\nOne year following their mutation, the Gene Dogs were assigned the task of recovering the Gene Scanner, a coveted technology targeted by Otomo, who dispatched his agents, theQ7 Strike Force, to retrieve it. The Gene Dogs successfully fended off the Strike Force, securing the Scanner. Tragically, Panther fell victim to Banzai's assault during the confrontation. S.T.O.R.M., in response, temporarily replaced Panther with Cat. Unbeknownst to Otomo, Mys-Tech had devised the Gene Scanner as a deceptive weapon, disguising it as a device with potent mutagenic capabilities. Mys-Tech manipulated Otomo into stealing the Scanner. They then employed Hurricane to retrieve it, subsequently leaking information to the Strike Force, who ambushed and captured both Hurricane and the Scanner. Eventually, the Gene Dogs formed an alliance with the Strike Force to eliminate the Scanner upon discovering its true nature as a bomb. During their mission, they learned that Panther had covertly worked as a Mys-Tech agent. Pursuing a false lead provided by Panther, they engaged in a confrontation with the group Genetix. Otomo and the Strike Force managed to escape, while Hurricane was once again imprisoned.[2]"

While growing up, Inez was teased for being a mutant and was called \"Crazy Inez\". Her father often had to keep her out of fights even though she could win.\nAs a hired mercenary, she was one of many hired to take out theFour Winds. However,Black Swanended up killing all the members. She later metDeadpoolafter he was accredited with the hit. She introduced herself to Wade while he was working out of Merc Works.[3]\nShe was later hired as security forDazzlerbut quit, leaving the job to Deadpool after the manager squeezed her butt. Later she was seen helpingAlex Hayden; she was certain he wasn'tDeadpooldue to Hayden being ambidextrous.\nThe owner of The Culver Sport and Gun Club put out an offer to anyone who could take thePunisher's Colt .45 handguns. After a night out on the town, Inez and Alex agreed to try and take Castle on and split the money. But Castle caught them in his apartment and dumped them in a phone booth minus their equipment and clothes. The Punisher then killed the owner of The Culver Sport and Gun Club.\nInez and Alex continued to work together along with Sandi andTaskmaster. Inez was wounded battlingCrossfire, but soon recovered.\nShe returned after her father died and discovered that in her absence, Alex had had an affair with his secretarySandi Brandenberg. Her rage vanished when she saw that Alex was being attacked by Black Swan. Black Swan called Outlaw \"Crazy Inez\" and in a fit of rage, Outlaw punched straight through his torso. This wasn't enough to kill him though, and together with Taskmaster and Sandi, they defeated Black Swan. Outlaw and Alex continued their relationship (as did Sandi and Taskmaster). She aided Alex Hayden with his mercenary company, Agency X.[4]\nAfterM-Day, Inez was one of the few mutants to retain her powers. HeedingCyclops's call for sanctuary, Outlaw went to theX-Mansionfor protection and ran intoPeepersalong the way, who was on the run from theSapien League. She was one of the 198, and bunked withMagmaandSkids. She struck a rather friendly relationship with Magma. She listened when Magma complained aboutEmpathalways following her and never leaving her alone even in her dreams.[5]\nInez has been seen living back in New York and helped Deadpool when he came to her asking for help after a fight with the Punisher. When the Punisher attacked again, her apartment was destroyed in the ensuing battle. Later, Deadpool bought her a new apartment. Realizing that he did not do this for selfish reasons, and that he cared for her, she had sex with him.[6]\nInez possesses various superhuman physical attributes as a result of genetic mutation.O*N*Eclassified her as aGeneral Threat.[9]\nSuperhuman Strength:Inez is superhumanly strong, sufficient to allow her to break human bones, punch through wooden beams[10]or a standard brick wall with ease. At her peak, Inez can lift about 2 tons.[2]\nSuperhuman Stamina:Inez's musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. She can physically exert herself at peak capacity for several hours before the buildup of fatigue toxins in her blood begins to impair her.[citation needed]\nSuperhuman Durability:The tissues of Inez's body are harder and more resistant to certain types of injury than an ordinary human, particularly injuries generally caused by impact forces. She can withstand impacts that would either severely injure or kill an ordinary human, such as falling from a height of several stories or being struck by a superhumanly strong being and sustain little to no physical injury.[2]Pool cues break upon hitting her body andDiamondback's explosive diamonds could only cause her superficial damage.[10]\nExpert Combatant:Inez is an experienced armed and unarmed combatant. However, she is more comfortable using conventional firearms during combat situations.[2]"

He blamedDeadpoolfor his brother's death, as he was among the targets of Deadpool's apparently-successful assassination of the Japanese crime lords named theFour Winds. After Black Swan downloaded a mental virus into Deadpool's brain, Deadpool came for both Swan and Nijo at the Swan's castle inGermany. However, Black Swan revealed he had in fact killed the Four Winds, including Nijo's brother, and stabbed him out of boredom with his ranting and disobedience. His vendetta with Deadpool was that the hits had erroneously been credited to the wrong man. A bomb Deadpool had brought went off, and all three were presumed killed.[3]\nAll three had partially merged during the explosion when Black Swan used his powers in an act of desperation to save himself. Black Swan psionically acquired Deadpool's healing factor but accidentally made contact with Nijo and their personality traits got mixed around. Swan also gave Nijo's corpse Deadpool's regenerative powers, restoring him to a form of life five minutes after his death. As well as part of his personality, Nijo also gained Swan's firearms talents, ambition, some of his refined tastes, preferences and biases, and also the bodily scarring and outrage he'd received from Deadpool throwing him face first into a white hot fireplace griddle at his home.[4]\nNijo soon reemerged as Alex Hayden inNew Yorkwith one goal in mind - to be the best mercenary alive. He was found bySandi Brandenberg, Deadpool's former secretary, who assumed he was Deadpool by his powers and demeanor. He subconsciously took the name as a combination of composers he liked: Alexander Grieg and Josef Haydn, which Sandi worked out through his fondness for classical music.[citation needed]\nSandi's friend and distant romantic interestTaskmasterwas sought to help him get his bearings and train him, as wasOutlaw (Inez Temple), for her shooting skills. Taskmaster noticed Alex was ambidextrous and that he was somehow interfering with his reflex ability while training with him. Taskmaster then knew he couldn't be Deadpool, despite his healing factor, and Outlaw corroborated this as Alex proved to be a better gun talent than Deadpool.[citation needed]\nSandi and Alex formed a mercenary group,Agency X. Their headquarters was based out of an amusement park Alex acquired as payment for his first mission.[citation needed]\nAlex ran into Outlaw while assigned to try and take out thePunisherand steal his Colt .45 handguns. They failed and were locked up in a phone booth minus their weapons and clothes by Castle. The Punisher then killed the people who had sent them. Afterwards, Outlaw and Alex became romantically involved. However, Taskmaster, who was jealous of Sandi's attachment to Alex, had set up Alex on that mission and he was kicked out of the agency. He then contactedHigashi, the new leader of part of the Four Winds organization and informed them that Alex was Deadpool, who still held the credit for killing the previous four crime heads. The organization, primarily directed by Higashi's enforcer,Saguri, therefore held Alex, Sandi and Taskmaster responsible but with Outlaw's help, the three made a last stand at the amusement park against an army of mercenaries and super-villains, while Sandi was given to Higashi to safekeeping, as his infatuation with her would keep her protected. Agency X were triumphant and Alex blackmailed the crime lords into submission, while killing Saguri after surreptitiously being hired by Higashi to do so. Higashi was also convinced by Sandi that Alex was not Wade Wilson and was now more fully in control of his group, so he agreed to prevent any further reprisals on the foursome. Alex was enthused at what appeared to be a fresh start for the Agency but was hurt when Outlaw announced her desire to return home to the South to care for her dying father instead, while Taskmaster declined a full-time position.[citation needed]\nAlex performed his assignments solo from then on, but he found his personal life further muddied when he and Sandi spent a night together. He became disillusioned with his work and decided to shut down the agency, but found himself unable to tell Sandi, who by then had set up a job for him and Taskmaster to act as bodyguards to Higashi as a final act of ceasefire. While on their way to a meeting between the Four Winds families, Alex's group was attacked by a pair of over-cheerful assassins, but after a frantic battle, they arrived safely to find one of the Four Winds families had ordered the hit on Higashi. Now that Higashi was indebted to them, Alex, Taskmaster and Sandi returned to Sandi's apartment to find Black Swan and a tabula rasa Deadpool waiting.[citation needed]\nBlack Swan proposed a three-way mind meld to restore each man to their correct personal states, but double-crossed them. Outlaw returned in time to help fight the Black Swan, who had now absorbed both Alex and Deadpool's powers to augment himself. Even though Alex called Higashi's favor in and surrounded Swan with hitmen, this proved to be fruitless, so Alex devised a new plan. After Taskmaster and Outlaw distracted him, Deadpool pinned Swan to Taskmaster's explosives-laden van and Alex ignited it. Alex then reversed Black Swan's absorption, but also gave him the memories of being caught in the bomb explosion in Germany. The group then repeatedly shot the Black Swan to make sure he was dead.[4]The body was taxidermized and carried around by each couple (Taskmaster and Sandi, Alex and Inez) as a prop while they went on vacation.[citation needed]\nWhen they later found themselves on opposing sides over the fate ofCable, Alex had another confrontation with Deadpool, which he lost initially, giving Deadpool the opportunity to spell out \"Hi, Weasel\" with his entrails as a \"surprise\" for his best friend. Unable to do much damage to each other due to their healing factors, they relented after Wade agreed to hand Alex his pancreas back.[citation needed]\nAfter a botched attempt to steal a device fromHydra, Sandi and Outlaw convinced Deadpool to rescue Alex. Alex had been affected by the device he was supposed to steal, giving him arthritis and \"the American gene\" (which resulted in making him incredibly fat). This made escape physically impossible - though he wouldn't want to miss out on the many treats and monkey chow that were being given to him as a lab specimen. Deadpool managed to free Alex with the help ofBob, Agent of HYDRA. He then asked Deadpool to run Agency X while he got himself back in shape, reasoning with himself that his only other alternatives were to shoot himself or eat Sandi and his business. He eventually returned to his original physique a few years later, as seen when he and Deadpool's allies rallied to aid Domino when her powers were on the fritz.[citation needed]\nRegenerative Healing Factor:Agent X possesses a superhuman healing factor allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed bodily tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. Agent X is able to heal injuries such as slashes, puncture wounds, bullet wounds, and severe burns within moments. His healing factor is developed to the point that he can regrow and reattach missing limbs and organs. His healing factor has allowed him to survive even brain punctures on numerous occasions. With this superior healing factor he has shown a unique tolerance towards pain.[1]\nExpert Combatant:Nijo is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and is a master in multiple unarmed combat techniques. He has been shown fighting such amazingly skilled fighters as Deadpool and Taskmaster and even defeating them in hand to hand combat. This shows that Nijo himself is among the most skilled fighters in the Marvel universe, granted that he was trained under Taskmaster. He has claimed to be a master of kung-fu, taekwondo, jeet kune do and sumo wrestling.[7]\nExpert Marksman:Trained byTaskmasterin marksmanship. He has also absorbedBlack Swan's years of experience.[1]"

A cowardly young man, Bob was persuaded into joining the criminal organizationHydraby his wife,Allison Dobalina, who accused him of not being able to hold a steady job. The thought of a stable career with a dental plan also appealed to Bob, though he was disappointed to find out Hydra does not offer full dental likeA.I.M.. DuringDeadpool's assault on aPakistanHydra Base, he ran into Bob and coerced him into helping him. Bob was hesitant, as Hydra would not allow him back into the organization after having betrayed them, but Deadpool, four inches tall at the time, tortured him with a security card until he relented. He then forced Bob to fly them to safety in one of Hydra jets, though Bob did not know how to pilot an aircraft.[3]\nBob, Agent of Hydra\nAfter Deadpool,Agent X, and Bob returned to the United States, they foundOutlawandSandimissing. Bob accompanied Deadpool on his mission to save the girls and subsequently became an honorary member ofAgency X. He continued to work with the group on their various missions, and was referred to as Deadpool's \"Pet\" (or \"Minion\", because that is \"more PC\"). Bob was then shot in the leg, during a raid on the very same HYDRA base Deadpool kidnapped him from, in an attempt to saveWeaselfromWolverine. When Wolverine cut off Deadpool's head, Bob was the one who put it back and let Deadpool's healing factor kick in. After Deadpool and Bob rescued Weasel, they were suddenly transported to the past, where they aidedCaptain AmericaandBuckyin stoppingArnim Zola. Following that adventure, Bob accompanied Deadpool on a mission through various dimensions to helpDoctor Strangesave reality after it was damaged byT-Ray's novice magic.[6]\nHe also travelled with Deadpool and Weasel to theSavage Land, where he ran away from an assortment of dinosaurs. Deadpool attempted to teleport the dinosaurs toGenoshaas a prank onMagneto, but instead they were sent to the Genoshan Embassy in downtownManhattan, and became infected with alienSymbiotes. During the resultant battle, Bob's attempted to flee and accidentally caused the death of one of the creatures while a news crew watched. Thinking his actions were intentional, they interviewed Bob and mistook the 'H' on his uniform as standing for \"Hero\". He then received a text message from Allison who had seen the events on the news and thought it was hot.[7]\nBob was later seen assisting Deadpool defeatTiger Shark. When Deadpool asked him what he was doing Bob replied \"U-uh saving you\". Then Deadpool told Bob to throw him the rifle, Bob threw it to him but it didn't reach him and instead fell into into the water where Tiger Shark was waiting because \"Bob throws like a girl\". He was then knocked into the water himself, however Deadpool saved him at the last second and they were able to outmaneuver Tiger Shark for a while. It was Bob, after a shot to the hand, that explained to Deadpool that he along with Tiger Shark were hired byNorman Osborn, who Deadpool soon realized stole from him during the height of the Secret Invasion against the Skrulls.[8]"

Fearing that their friends would opt to euthanize Wanda rather than risk her unmaking reality, Wanda's twinQuicksilverconvinced her to create analternate realitywhere they and their friends had the lives they had always wanted.[8]\nIn this reality, mutants were the dominant race and Magneto was the world's ruler. However, this reality soon came undone as the heroes regained their memories of the real world. Upon learning what Quicksilver had done, Magneto killed him in a fit of rage. Wanda resurrected her brother, and distraught and angry over the fact that their father had always cared more about mutantkind than his own children, theScarlet Witchthen changed reality again, this time attempting to rid the world of themutant geneby casting another spell; \"No More Mutants\".[8]\nThis event occurred at 11:15, a Tuesday morning inNew York City,[1]or off-coast ofCallao,Peruat 3:00 PM in the afternoon of November 2nd.[9]\nTheDecimationreduced the mutant population down to a few hundred, as most mutants weredepoweredand some others werekilledas a result of losing their powers.\nIn total,986,618 mutantswere either depowered or killed by the Decimation.[10]If not for the intervention ofEmma FrostandDr. Strange, every single mutant would have lost their powers..[11]\nAt the time of theDecimation, it was first estimated that 91.4% of the world's mutant population lost their powers overnight.[12]The US Government estimated a number of198mutants,[13]cataloged, but acknowledged that there were a few thousands,[13]around300individuals who were recognized as mutants,[14]andTony Starkadmitted that a low estimate had been produced.[13]Dani Moonstarstated that there were 198 known mutants, but others had remained off the grid until then, includingJonas GraymalkinorLeon Nunez,[15]but also known mutants, like the\"199th mutant\", off the record of the 198 as part of a deal with the government,[14]orWiz Kidwho hacked intoS.H.I.E.L.D.'s database.[16][citation needed]\nThe 198/\"less than 200\" estimation was although often used as the correct number,[17]as well as \"9/10\"[13]or \"two hundred remaining mutants\".[18]ACerebroestimateda decrease of 91.4%of the world's mutant population in the moments after the M-Day,[12]when Tony Stark stated (after theCivil War) that over 99.99% of the mutants were.[19]It was often stated that \"90%\"[20]or \"over\"[21]of the mutants lost their powers.\nIt was stated thata million mutants[9][22]or more[23]were depowered on M-Day. This tallies with a rounding up of the 986,618 figure.[10]\nIn the soleXavier Institute, the mutant students count wentfrom 182 to 27.[24]\nMany mutants thought to be depowered were later revealed to have maintained their powers, having hidden their mutant powers and/or their presence to the world, while many of the still-powered werekilledduring the violence that followed the Decimation.\nThese different counts, along with the low number of individuals using their powers in public made some calculations very risky and absurd:\nInJapan, except for a few exceptions who entered service for the Japanese government, all mutants were officially depowered.[28]\n\nTheSapien Leaguetook advantage of the situation by attacking the mansion and any mutants attempting to reach it.[24]\nTheX-Corpoffice of Paris was bombed, and Cyclops consequently dissolved the organization.[24]\nTheXavier Institutebecame a haven for those who still had their mutant powers, many of them attempting to escape persecution. Against the wishes of Institute professorsEmma FrostandScott Summers, the government assignedSentinel Squad O*N*Eto protect the mansion and its inhabitants.[32]\nMutants at the Institute rallied around the number \"198\", an early government estimate of how many powered mutants were left in the entire world.[33]\nReporterSally Floydinterviewed a number of depowered mutants for herMutant Diariesreport. However, a serial killer calling himself theGhoulmurdered several of those whom she interviewed, leaving \"Not enough died\" as a marker. The Ghoul was eventually killed in an explosion during an attempt to capture him by the X-Men. Given the nature of his teleportation powers, it's possible that the Ghoul survived.[34]\nThe Collective with the mutant energies from M-Day\nWhen the Scarlet Witch depowered mutants, she did not destroy the energy those mutants possessed. Instead, the energies got expelled from their bodies.[35]While passing some orbiting rocks, the energy awakened a dormantVulcan(who was fused withDarwin). This massively boosted Vulcan's powers (and also Darwin's).[36]Eventually leaving orbit and entering the atmosphere, the energy was absorbed by theCollective, turning him into an immensely powerful and dangerous being; the energies later got dispersed into the Sun.[37]\nX-Cell, a group of former mutants who blamed the United States government for losing their powers, began a terrorist campaign.[38]With the overwhelming majority of Mutant Town's residents now depowered, the label quickly began to lose all meaning.[39]\nSomehow,Onslaughtwas brought back to life, and chasedFranklin RichardstoCounter-Earth.[40]\nAll dead, banished, or inanimate, theSalem's Sevenwere all returned, includingBrutacuswho is part mutant.[41]\nFrightened by the end of mutantkind, Beast went on the search for a cure.[42]He made a broad appeal to the scientific community, both heroes such asMr. FantasticandIron Man, but also villains likeDr. DoomandMr. Sinister. All either rejected him or failed to provide aid. Desperate for help, Beast was joined by his unscrupulous alternate reality counterpartDark Beast.[42]\nThe two made no progress, and after the Dark Beast endagered an innocent attempting to test a cure, Beast parted ways with him. He decided to track down the Scarlet Witch herself, and found her inTransia, seemingly with no memory of her past. Wanda provided no answers and encouraged Beast to move on, as didDr. Strange..[43]\nThe X-Gene was erased from theDepowered Mutants, without any trace.[44]Depowered mutants were detected asHumansby devices such asCerebra.[45][46]\nThe Decimation effected the DNA of every mutant, even when separated from its source:Mutant Growth Hormone(MGH) provided by depowered mutants was rendered useless.[47]\nHowever,Astramanaged to create a seemingly poweredcloneof theBlobdespite the fact that the original had been de-powered.[48]\nWhile the M-Day effect was initially thought to be irreversible, some methods proved more or less effective in restoring mutant powers. Please consult theRepowered Mutantsand the ways they got their powers back.\nIn concordance with theHigh Evolutionary,Magnetowas able to construct a machine to restore his powers, using theDreaming Celestialand the product of what they called \"a Celestial lobotomy\". The machine however, was not only nearly impossible to construct but extremely dangerous. The process worked, and Magneto regained his mutant powers at the cost of the machine itself.[49][50]\nApocalypsemanaged to restore the powers ofPolaris(depowered by M-Day) after turning her into one of hisHorsemen. It was believed that Apocalypse simply gave her powers similar to her old ones through other means, but he seemingly managed to re-activate Polaris' X-Gene.[51]\nAfter one ofLegion's rogue personas, dubbing itselfMoira, altered reality to create aworld of constant war and strugglewhere he was ahero, some aspects of this reality bled through into the real world after Legion restored it. One of these aspects were the powers ofChamber. In this reality created by Legion, Chamber once again had his mutant powers in their old state, and upon returning reality to it's original form, Chamber kept his restored powers.[52]\nAfter falling into theM'kraan Crystaland drifting into theWhite Hot Room,Professor Xavierregained his telepathic powers upon emerging.[53]\nWanda Maximoffwas able to reverse the M-Day effect on one mutant,Rictor. After losing the source of her enhanced powers, the Life Force, however, Wanda was unable to reverse it for anyone else.[54]\nThe return of mutant messiahHope Summersto the present triggered the first activated mutations since her own and M-Day. It is believed that this, along with Hope's unique ability to stabilize these mutants, were an extension of her relationship with thePhoenix Force.[55]\nThe Phoenix Force travelled to Earth to claimHope Summersas its host in order to reverse the Scarlet Witch's curse. It did so successfully, after Hope used its powers to re-ignite mutations across the world. This only caused new mutant births however, and did not restore the powers of previously depowered mutants.[56]\nAfter the founding of the mutant nation ofKrakoa, a group of mutants known as theFivewere created, composed ofHope Summers,Proteus,Tempus,Egg, andElixir. The Five were tasked with resurrecting mutants who had died prematurely. The Five able to revive depowered mutants with their powers intact, presumably in part due to Proteus' reality warping powers.[57]\nKnown as the198(which also was the name of agroupof mutants gathered into theXavier Institute).\nAmong the unnamed powered mutants to be counted areGargouille's boyfriend[58]and a fire-breather,[59]both killed byPredator X.Utopia[60]andRavencroft Asylum for the Criminally Insane[61]also appeared to had various unidentified mutants.\nThe Decimation extended even to mutants who were already dead on M-Day. When Selene reawakened the dead of Genosha and elsewhere, she discovered that many of her undead subjects no longer possessed their mutant abilities as a result of M-Day.[62]Please consult theKnown Pre-M-Day Deceased Powered Mutants.\nPlease consult theM-Day Depowered mutants."

They were able to do this via a protocol unknowingly into Spider-Man's cameras called the \"Goblin Protocol\", which \"hid\" anyone bearing a Goblin mask or a marking of a Goblin mask from the cameras.\nThe Nation finally struck during Spidey's lowest point - alienating himself from other heroes by his own ego, Otto could only watch as the Goblins made their first attack on his home basethe Raft, renamed \"Spider-Island II\", destroying it and killing hisSpiderlingsbefore proceeding to run rampant across New York City. Having learned the truth behind Spider-Man's change in persona, the Nation set things up so that everything connected to Octavius was destroyed, leading the villain to finally break down and admit that Peter was the real hero, not him.\nThe Nation was quickly dismantled when Peter Parker reclaimed his body and rallied Miguel O'Hara and the Avengers into taking back the streets, leading to a final fight with the Green Goblin, in which the madman was finally defeated.[2]\nFollowing that events, Urich, now the new self appointed Goblin King, take the lead of the Goblin Nation remnants, which became one of the main organized crime powers in New York. He called upon two other crime powers,Mister Negative'scriminal empire and theMaggiafraction lead by theEel, to divide the criminal underground. While Urich and Negative were waiting for the Eel, they were surprised to see him crashing into the place from a window. They were confronted by theBlack Cat, who wanted the Eel's part. Negative refused, as he claimed Hardy only had reputation, which was destroyed by the Spider. She claimed that all of them had been outed by him, but that she will be successful in what they failed, to defeat him.[3]"

Osborn and Karkov escaped while leaving the Kingslayer to deal with Spider-Man and Silver Sable.[1]When Silver Sable and Spider-Man invaded Symkaria with the intention to overthrow its current leaders, Sablinova confronted Countess Karkov and defeated her in a fencing duel.[4]\nDespite being sentenced to house arrest, Karkov's influence continued growing. Since Symkaria's economy still depended on arms manufacturing contracts, the country maintained its newfound military strength, which was not taken kindly by Symkaria's neighboring countryLatveriafollowingDoctor Doom's return to power. With border skirmishes increasingly rapidly, Karkov intended to use the war to return to power. To this end, Countess Karkov employed the mercenaryHitmanto target Doctor Doom when he visitedNew York Cityfor aUNhearing.[5]Expecting Doom to send a decoyDoombotto the hearing, Hitman was provided with a smart bullet which allowed Karkov to infiltrate the Doombots' network in contact.[6]\nIn retaliation for the apparent attempt on his life, Doom summonsed an army of Doombots to besiege Manhattan.[7]Spider-Man convinced Doom to retreat, but Karkov had the Doombots hacked and used them to damage cultural institutions and infrastructure. Unwilling to admit that he had lost control of his own network, Doom accepted the blame for the attack. As a result, the international community rallied behind Symkaria, pouring money and soldiers into the country's military efforts to Karkov's benefit.[8]"

The Geminis tell Scorpio that if he goes on with the plan when planned, he will most likely succeed. But if he forcesS.H.I.E.L.D.'s hand tonight, their allySpider-Manwill abandon them. Scorpio decides to strike now and tells them to inform all their houses that it's time. In theHelicarrier, from low orbit,Furyis coordinating a global attack on all theZodiacbases. Various S.H.I.E.L.D. teams, along with theHuman Torchand theProwler, are preparing to attack the bases. Fury asks Spider-Man andMockingbirdwhere they are, but Spidey gets a call and hangs up on Fury. AboveMadagascar, Spidey and Mocking bird are travelling viaWeb-Jet. She asks him what call outranks S.H.I.E.L.D. and he replies that hisAunt May'sdoes. He darkens his suit and the jet's cockpit to take his Aunt's video call. May andJayare in a village inNadua, where theUncle Ben Foundationis setting up solar panels. She tells Peter that they are going to change many people's lives and thatBenwould be proud of him. He tells her that he would be proud of her and Jay too, and of all the work everyone is putting in this. But they are interrupted when suddenly laughter is heard andpumpkin bombsfall from the sky.\nPeter suddenly loses the signal, causing him to decide to go to Nadua and abandon S.H.I.E.L.D. on their mission. Mockingbird protests as the mission depends on them and says she'll have to take control of the jet. Peter simply ejects her from the Web-Jet and tells her to click a button on her belt, activating a wing update on her suit, and flies to Nadua. In the village the Naduan military, armed withGoblinparaphernaliaand calling themselves theWar Goblins, ask all loyal Naduyans to leave while they deal with the foreigners on the General's orders. May and Jay try to get the kids to safety, Parker Industries security team is outmatched, andOkiro, the village's leader explains thatGeneral Mwenyecontrols which charities are allowed in Nadua. A War Goblin chases after May, but is knocked out by Spider-Man, who attacks the Goblins with the Web-Jet's web-cannons. They quickly regroup and hit the Webjet, cauisng it to crash. But Peter survives thanks to its web-foam airbags and leaves the jet, thinking to himself that the airbags need more testing.\nMeanwhile, Fury expresses his anger over Spider-Man going AWOL during a global strike, and uses S.H.I.E.L.D.'s satellites to coordinate an attack on the Zodiac's bases. He asks for an update and if anyone has seen Scorpio. Around the world, S.H.I.E.L.D. teams are attacking Zodiac bases, but there is no sign of Scorpio. Prowler arrives at the Zodiac'sChileanbase, only to find that the base is false and finding only props and sets. The same happens inMalta,AlgeriaandIceland, causing Fury to ask what's going on. In Nadua, Spider-Man makes it to the villages, where Jay and May were about to head off to the crash site to see if he was okay. He explains that Peter sent him and they told him that they are all okay as the War Goblins stopped attacking them to go for the solar farm. May is horrified that all their work is being destroyed, but Spidey tells her that it can be replaced, yet they can't. But one of the villagers,Issa, realizes that her children are gone. Using infrared lenses, Peter finds them hiding under a solar panel and runs to save them. With no buildings to swing from, he becomes an easy target for the Goblins. So he asks them if they are real soldiers or mercenaries, in which case he offers to pay \"top-dollar\" for them to switch sides, but they keep firing on him.\nHowever, he is saved by Mockingbird, who came flying from Madagascar, and says he will need every penny to give her the world's biggest raise. Peter goes to save the children while Bobbi fights the Goblins. Spidey asks the children,KwasiandAdoma, what are they doing there. She explains that they were there because it was cooler, but not because of the shade but because of the cooling system of the panel's magnets. Spidey is surprised by her intelligence, and Kwasi explains that she is always asking theParker Industriespersonnel questions and searching things on the internet. He asks Spidey why are they being attacked, and he explains that some people don't like it when others have power. Adoma says that he should take away their power. He tries to explain that it's not that simple, but she tells him that it it and that there are magnets down there. Realizing what he is suggesting, he tells her that she just won a Parker Industries college scholarship. He sends them running back to their mother, and uses his Z-Metal Bug-Zappers to over charge the magnets in the panels causing a magnetic pulse, causing Mockigbird's wings and the Goblin Gliders to malfunction. He catches Bobbi, while the War Goblins fall to the ground and are captured by Parker Industries' security team.\nMay tells Spidey to thank Peter for sending him to help them, but he insists the she isn't Peter's aunt, she raised him as his mother and he would stop the world for her. Bobbi reminds him that they will have problems for leaving S.H.I.E.L.D., but he says he doesn't care and tells Okiro that they will rebuild the panels and restart their humanitarian projects, but he rejects them. Okiro says that they made them a target and if the panels return, the General will send more Goblins. So unless he can stay to protect them forever, they have to go. Later, Okiro calls someone via his Webware. He explains that Parker's security and Spider-Man are gone, but he fears further attacks from the War Goblins. He tells them that they don't have much to trade which, but they have the equipment they left behind and hopes that will be enough to buy them weapons to defend themselves against the Goblins. The man he is calling, Osborn, tells him that he is very familiar with the Goblin tech. Knowing it is his business, and business is booming.\nIn theAndru Correctional Facility,New York, theLizardis escorted to the visitor's room. After the guards are clear, they remove his restrains. Beyond reinforced glass, the visitor,the man in the red suit, claims that he has met Connors before. Connors detects familiar scents accompanying the man, scents that can't be there, and warns him not to toy with the Lizard. The man replies that he is not the Lizard, inside he is Curt Connors, a model prisoner who savedthe Mayorand various civilians before, and is trapped in a monster's body. Connors lashes out at him, demanding to know how can the people he is smelling be there. The man says that Connors has abilities he can use and if he escapes and joins him, he can give him anything. He snaps his fingers andMarthaandBilly, the Lizard's dead wife and son respectively, step forward. The man asks if they have a deal and the Lizard tearfully says they do.\n• Not only has Spider-Man gone global – so have his enemies!\n• Someone in Africa is masquerading as a member of the GOBLIN family!"

Turning into Captain America, she defeated the assassin, but wasn't able to stop him from committing suicide. The next day, Alchemax CEOMiguel Stonesent the team to investigateMartin Hargood, whom he believed to have hired Specialist. Locating him at a restaurant calledLatverian Cuisine, they found him arguing withJohn Eisenhart. When the team ignored Eisenhart's orders to leave, he revealed that he was the vigilante known as the Hulk and attacked them. Upon taking the fight outside, they were confronted by Hulk's teammates, theDefenders.[1]\nAfter settling their differences, the two teams brought Hargood back toAlchemax Towerto be interrogated. Later, Miguel offered the Defenders a place at Alchemax, but they declined; however, since it was illegal to be a superhero team operating outside of Alchemax, Miguel then declared them criminals.[8]\nCaptain America rebelled against Miguel's orders, claiming that treating heroes like villains this way was unfair, and they should support their principles, freedom, and ideologies. With the help ofHercules, she managed to rescue the Defenders who had been taken prisoner, while fighting against her fellow teammates. After the Defenders had escaped, Captain America's husband, Harry, triggered a fail-safe to turn her back to her alter ego of Roberta Mendez.

Hercules tried to calm her by revealing her origin to her, but that only frightened her more. Miguel than called her and used the codeword for her transformation back to Captain America through her ear device. He told her to bring the Defenders back to help battle theDweller-in-Darkness, whom Hargood had summoned after revealing himself to be Baron Mordo. Captain America lead the attack on Mordo and was the one to defeat him. The Captain then watched as Strange sent the Dweller back where it came from. Later, she was present when Miguel undeclared the Defenders outlaws and personally thanked them for their help before they left.[6]\nWhen theMultiversewas restored byReed Richards,[10]Roberta found herself in thePrime Marvel Universe, and although she had no memory of her past life, she believed her hallucinations of her family were real. Unknown to Roberta, her Captain America personality had also survived.[11]She not only remembered their past,[3]but had figured out that her boss atParker Industries,Miguel O'Hara, was an alternate version of her former boss, Miguel Stone, and was secretly the vigilante Spider-Man.[12]\nCurious, Cap influenced Roberta to go into thebuilding's basement and activate Miguel'sTime Vault. Stepping intoEarth-15329, Roberta was pushed back into Earth-616 byQweeg, as the portal closed behind them. Their encounter triggered Roberta's transformation into Captain America. The pair exchanged blows, but even with Miguel coming to her aid as Spider-Man, Qweeg evaded capture and Captain was determined that the two heroes capture him to send him back to Earth-15329.[13]While they were able to catch up to him, Qweeg was rescued by the terrorist groupFist.[3]"

He grew even more worried after theU.S. Congressdecided to cut funds for theSanto Angelo Contras, a group of freedom fighters led byGeneral Accardo. He decided to let the contras deliver unrefined drugs to him through a courier, then arranged corrupt bankerForrest Huntto have them sold (in exchange for a share) to the New York CityCosta mob. He used the drug money (which the mob first laundered through Hunt) to buy advanced weaponry for Accardo's men. As part of the deal, he also allowed himself to use his weapon dealers contacts (which he gained through his diplomatic position) in order to buy even more weapons to supply the Costa clan. Later, just after earning U.S. citizenship by marrying and fathering a daughter with an american woman,Angela, Montoya learned the Congress had reinstated funds to the Santo Angelo contras. Knowing he would not have permitted the drug dealing to go along after that, Hunt decided to cut Montoya out of the deal, as he didn't want to renounce to the profits. After discovering Hunt's plot, he resolved to have him killed by placing fake drug in Hunt's suitcase and causing the Costas to execute him for supposedly trying to trick them. Unfortunately,Frank Castleand his family stumbled upon the scene. They were all killed with the exception of Frank. Hunt also briefly survived and tried to clean his reputation by telling his son,Jason, he was trying to support the Santo Angelo contras and was betrayed by Montoya, then succumbed to his wounds. Eventually, Montoya also attempted to kill his courier, but failed to do this and was identified and arrested.[1]"

Initially aUS Marineand later a contractor forEaglestar International, his life took a drastic turn when he was captured and subjected to experiments byDr. Aliana AlbaofWeapon X's Batch-H division. This division aimed to create powerful mutant-killing cyborgs, resulting in Clayton becoming Weapon H, a hybrid ofHulkandWolverine.[7]\nWeapon H's emergence coincided with clashes involving the Hulk, mutants, and the sinister schemes of organizations like Weapon X andRoxxon. His unique blend of abilities and consciousness led him to rebel against his creators, embarking on a mission to protect his family and confront the forces that sought to control him.[8]Throughout his adventures, Weapon H faced off against various threats, including the creation of Roxxon'sUr-Wendigo, encounters with theBrood-infested creatures engineered by Roxxon, and battles againstSkrullduggersunleashed upon Earth. Despite facing manipulation and coercion from entities like Roxxon and the Leader, Weapon H ultimately sought freedom for himself and his loved ones.[9]\nHis journey intersected with other iconic heroes, such as the Hulk, Wolverine,Captain America, andBlack Widow, as he navigated through conflicts like theWar of the Realms[10]and the schemes of Carnage during theAbsolute Carnageevent.[11]\nClayton Cortez had a rough childhood as he had been beaten by his father and bullies while growing up.[12]He became aMarineandEaglestarcontractor whose team was hired to take out the villagers ofUjankafor sabotaging aRoxxonpipeline. Growing a conscience amidst the massacre, Clay killed his own men, resulting in his capture and subsequent sale toDr. Alba, the head ofWeapon X's Batch-H division, which focused on the creation of Hulk/Wolverine hybridmutant-killing cyborgs.[7]H-Alpha was different from Weapon X's other subjects in many ways; firstly, he wasn't personally recruited byDirector Stryker, so he wasn't a \"true believer\" of his cause;[13]secondly, Alba left more of his brain than in other subjects, with the intention to better train and discipline him.[13]\nClayton being subjected to the Hulk/Wolverine-hybridizing experiments\nWhen theHulkanda group of mutantsinvestigated Weapon X and raided theircentral command, H-Alpha had fifteen minutes left of incubation before he could be released.[14]The release ofH-Betabought Dr. Alba enough time to finish H-Alpha's process, and she eventually released him. H-Alpha joined the brawl between H-Beta and the Hulk. Due to his programming to act as an apex predator, H-Alpha beheaded H-Beta. He then turned on his creators, which Alba theorized was because H-Alpha had enough of his original brain to resent the atrocities they did to him. Hulk held him back, and they continued fighting. Once the Weapon X staff had fled the scene, H-Alpha abruptly stopped fighting, and escaped by jumping away.[3]\nIn order to protect the family he barely remembered he had, Weapon H went from Eaglestar facility to Eaglestar facility wiping out every data about him they had so people like Stryker wouldn't target them.[15]In one of such facilities, Clay ended up being injected with a nanite strain capable of resetting his command settings by Dr. Alba,[7][15]who then commanded him to attack Stryker and his cyborgs.[7]When Weapon H was commanded by Dr. Alba to kill the entire population ofPhoenixto prove his perfection,[16]the same group of mutants who raided the Weapon X central command with the Hulk, whom Weapon H had previously encountered and easily defeated,[17]andWolverinebroke him free from Dr. Alba's control; prompting him to resume his mission of erasing any trace of his family to keep them safe.[15]\nTrying to stay off the radar, Clayton tried to pass as a Spanish worker, but he eventually lost control and transformed. Clayton attempted to stay away from civilians by hiding in the forest, but he found himself compelled to aid an archaeological expedition while keeping his distance after they were dropped without their rations case. When the expedition turned out to be a cover for theRoxxon Corporationto obtain aWendigo, Clayton intervened and stopped the newly-createdUr-Wendigofrom killingDr. Ella Sterling, exposing himself to Roxxon by doing so.[5]He tried to get Dr. Sterling to safety afterwards, but the Ur-Wendigo caught him mid-air and took a bite of him, growing larger than before. As he was about to be eaten whole by the Ur-Wendigo,Doctor Strange, who had been observing everything from theSanctum Sanctorum, burst onto the scene and shoot some magic arrows at the monster, making it release Weapon H. Weapon H allowed himself to be eaten by the monster so he could useDoctor Strange's axto kill it from within.[8]\nIn theOlympic National ParkinWashington, a bunch ofBrood-infested wolves ran past some hikers as they hunted down Clay. After flashing back to a moment seven years ago to his honeymoon withSonia, Clay arrived inBellevueas he tried not to turn into Weapon H. It was then revealed that the Brood-Wolves were engineered by Roxxon underDario Agger's orders as he instructed them to have the Brood-Wolves attack people. Clay used his claws to save prisoners on work release inRoseburg,Oregonfrom the Brood-Wolves. After slaying them, Clay turned into Weapon H to fight anAcantiand the Brood Drones that arrived. When Dario saw his fighting moves on the screen, a scientist stated that Weapon H somehow knew Krav Maga, jujitsu, and the Breakworld Death Punch, which Weapon H used to knock out the Acanti. Then Brood-Sky Sharkswere unleashed as Weapon H started slaying them. Dario Agger had the scientist look up the database of the military organization that taught the moves that Weapon H had used on the Brood-infested creatures. Afterwards, Weapon H ripped a Brood-Human out of the Acanti as the Brood-Human stated that Roxxon only wanted to hire him. While stating that people who hired him to protect people actually want to kill people, Weapon H had the Brood-Human carry a message to Roxxon: to leave him alone. Clay was later seen flashing back to a moment with Sonia when Dario had the scientist initiate the spawn ofa Man-Thinginthe same forest.[9]\nThe Man-Thing attacked Weapon H, while Agger began talking to him through his Fly-Spies, threatening Clay. Weapon H managed to use the Man-Thing's immolation touch to set the forest on fire. His wife arrived at the scene, and after subduing the monster Weapon H threw Dr. Stirling and Sonia into a nearby lake before extinguishing the fire with his clap. Unfortunately, he was suddenly captured by a Roxxon aircraft, with Agger praising Clay's sacrifice.[18]Agger bound Weapon H using an Elvish Binding Scroll, forcing Clay to collaborate with the company. Seeing that Weapon H wouldn't comply Agger had Dr. Baines to lobotomize him. However, Dr. Stirling intervened by shutting down the laboratory's power, allowing Weapon H to break free. As he escaped Cortez came across the Brood hybrid Blake and the Man-Thing in cages, begging him to set them free. He did so as they had been forced to follow Roxxon's orders. While fighting the security robots, Weapon H was reunited with Stirling and Sonia, only for Agger to appear to them again. He explained that he needed them as they had opened a portal to a dimension filled with monsters which also contained magic that could be used as unlimited power source.[19]\nClay and his allies decided to collaborate with the corporation this time to fight the monsters. He was informed by Dr. Baines that the dimension was known asWeirdworldand because of the damage caused to the laboratory the portal was fractured, allowing monsters like theSkrullduggersto arrive to their world and attack humans. Everyone got out of the facility before it exploded. The Skrullduggers soon emerged and Weapon H and his allies prepared to fight them, but found that they could shapeshift. When some Skrullduggers shapeshifted into children, Weapon H was prevented from attacking them byCaptain Americawho mistook the monsters for actual kids. However, the Skrullduggers dropped the facade and began attacking nearby citizens. Clay and Captain America decided to fight the monsters together.[20]As they fought, the group was informed that the Skrullduggers originated from a planet governed by theSkrull Empire, leading to Agger ordering them to kill them as they were an invasive species with no protection, but Captain America was against this, instead opting to contactAlpha Flightto deal with the aliens. After defeating the Skrullduggers, the heroes prepared one live specimen for a Alpha Flight xenobiologist to study only for it to be killed by Agger. Cortez became furious at Agger, but was convinced by Captain America to join Roxxon as an inside man.[12]\nWeapon H was met withKorgwho informed him that the Roxxon soldiers left in Weirdworld were safe in a bunker. Clay agreed to go to Weirdworld in exchange for Roxxon leaving him and his family alone, restore Blake to his human form and compensate him by giving him ten million dollars. He was joined by Man-Thing, Korg, Blake,TitaniaandAngel, the latter two brought in by Agger to help with the mission, and after contacting his family, went to Weirdworld. Upon arriving, they were attacked by theInakuas they blamed them for the Skrullduggers abducting theirqueen.[21]The group were confronted by the Inaku'sProtector Harawho believed that Roxxon was responsible for the deaths of their fellow Inaku. Weapon H fought back, destroying Hara's orb, allowing Titania to knock Hara out. However, this caused the dome protecting the Inaku from the Skrullduggers to be destroyed. As Korg and Titania remained with the Inaku to protect them from the Skrullduggers, Weapon H with Blake and Angel went to search for the Roxxon outpost, and while on their way Clay was contacted by Agger who ordered him to kill the Skrullduggers and was informed by Sonia about the Roxxon employees being trapped in the bunker by the aliens. The trio fought their way through the Skrullduggers and into the outpost where they found out that Roxxon had kidnapped Morgan Le Fay to use her as a power source.[22]\nWeapon H protested the imprisonment of Le Fay, despiteDr. Carrie Espinozaand Angel's warnings. Le Fay told them that she had managed to take control of the Skrullduggers but after being captured it caused the Skrullduggers to go loose. As she slowly took control of both Weapon H and Blake, revealing his full name as Clayton Cortez and promising Blake to turn him back into a human, Dr. Espinoza opened the door to let the Skrullduggers in, forcing Cortez to block them. Le Fay then revealed that Angel was in fact Black Widow and accused her of being sent by Captain America to spy on Cortez. She managed to retake control of the Skrullduggers and along with Weapon H escaped, planning to use them to take over the world.[1]Back to the Inaku's village, where the Inaku join their queen in attacking Korg and Titania. Black Widow attempted to break the mind control by having Sonia talk through Cortez, but the transmission was hijacked by Agger telling them he had a map to get them out it led to a box canyon. Sonia knocked Agger out and took a speeder to go to Cortez. After breaking free of Le Fay's control Cortez went to Agger in order to prevent him from using a bomb to solve the problem.[23]\nAgger then decided to fight Le Fay on his own and transformed into the Minotaur. As the two fought, Weapon H made sure for everyone to leave Weirdworld. After making sure everyone safely evacuated, Cortez attempted to leave himself, but was attacked by a furious Agger due to his plans being ruined. Cortez told him that he accomplished his mission and it was up to Agger if he wanted to remain. In the end, the two left Weirdworld just as the portal closed. Agger was forced to keep his promises, gave Cortez and his wife the money and new identities in order to live in peace, but before going Cortez warned Agger to never hurt his family again.[24]\nAfter watching the news about theHulkfighting theAvengersin a restaurant, Cortez and his family made their way back to their home. Upon arriving, Cortez began sneezing and and having a bad feeling told Sonia to take the kids on a ride. Following their departure, Cortez went out to be confronted by Bruce Banner. Banner told him that his work had been stolen and use to create him, but Cortez stated that he had been an unwilling participant. However, as Cortez sneezed again he began beating Bruce until nighttime arrived at which point both of them transformed into Hulks. The Hulk attempted to drain Weapon H's powers but instead also began sneezing. Weapon H managed to defeat the Hulk, leaving theLeader--who had secretly infected Cortez with a gamma-altering virus--to reveal himself and demanded him to kill the Hulk. He threatened Cortez to hurt his family, but then set off some bombs to get away. Weapon H attempted to track him down only to be confronted byWolverine.[25]\nJust like the Hulk, Wolverine accused Weapon H of taking his DNA, but Cortez left the fight and went after the Leader only to see him teleporting away before fighting agents from theU.S. Hulk Operations. Hulk then arrived to beat Weapon H, but was ended up fighting the agents instead, allowing Wolverine to take Cortez to a nearby gas station. After some talking, the two caught up with the Hulk nearLake Erie's shores where the green behemoth again attacked Cortez. The fight came to an end when the sun rose up, forcing the Hulk to regress to his human form. The three then swam to an underwater hideout where Cortez's family was residing. As the two heroes met the family the hideout was attacked by the Leader'sHumanoids.[26]\nWeapon H fought the giant robots in order to protect his family, but both Banner and Logan were abducted. Cortez then joined Captain America and Black Widow inShadow Base Auto-Op WMD Facility BX97which was being attacked by the Hulk and Wolverine who had been mutated to resemble each other and Weapon H and were under the control of the Leader through theSternbots. Fighting the two, Weapon H lured both the Hulk and Wolverine to the Leader and Dr. Alba's location where he proceeded to destroy the teleporter. Alba retracted the Sternbots from both the Hulk and Wolverine in order to use them to take control of Weapon H, but fortunately for him this didn't work. However, the Leader managed to repair his teleporter and got himself and Alba away from there. With the threat neutralized, Cortez, Hulk and Wolverine returned to their lives.[27]\nWeapon H, under the request of Captain America, was recruited byCaptain Marvelinto herWar Avengersstrikeforce alongsideDeadpool,Venom,Sif,Winter Soldier, andCaptain Britain. He helped in taking down theFrost Giantsin theSonoran Desert, before attempting to fightMalekithhimself in Europe, but to no avail, resulting in him stealing the symbiote.[10]After the War Avengers regrouped, they assisted Captain Britain in the final fight against the Frost Giants.[28]\nMutant / Gamma Mutate Cyborg:H-Alpha was subjected to experiments that grafted him the DNA of bothLogan, theHulk, and a host of other powered individuals. His skeleton was additionally bonded toAdamantium.[13]H-Alpha also possesses the ability to change to and from his human form in spite of having his skeleton laced with Adamantium. It has been theorized nanotechnology reverse-engineered fromLady Deathstrikecould make this possible. According to Dr. Alba, Weapon H could kill every living being on Earth.[2]\nMemory Loss:Clayton suffered some sort of amnesia and couldn't remember much about his past, except vague flashbacks of his time in theEaglestar Corporation, as well as his first name. This is possibly a side effect of the experiments that were conducted on him by the Weapon X program.[2]Currently all his lost memories have gradually recovered.[24]\nUncontrollable Rage:Just like Banner and Amadeus, possessing the power of the Hulk has given Clayton his own inner beast whom he has to constantly restrain, meaning he must always control his emotions if he doesn't want to lose control while in his Hulk form.[5]"

First, a protest by supposed environmental activists but secretly funded by Stark's rivals in the oil industry deploys mercenaries outfitted with Melter weaponry to destroy the reactor, but Stark's \"bodyguard\", Iron Man, stops the attackers while Stark's investigators reveal the plot. Before Tony can relax, he becomes aware of developments in the conflict in Transia between Muslim Romani separatists and Slavic paramilitaries that have somehow become outfitted with variants of the original Iron Man armor and repulsor tech weapons. Stark's investigators can't identify the leak, and his advisors tell him that he can't intervene in Transia without violating international law and alienating Russia and China due to their interests in the region. Tony can't rest, and later that night, after his janitor finds him watching the news and tells him he could do whatever he wants, he decides to get directly involved.\nThree days later, Iron Man invades Transia. His progress is observed by the forces of Doctor Doom, who is positioned to take advantage of the conflict.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nEvents:\nAcross the globe, the evil Red tyrantWong-Chutakes over another small village inVietnam, defeating its strongest men in contests of judo. Meanwhile, Tony Stark has arrived in Vietnam to observe the testing micro-transistor-powered weaponry, which allow heavy items like mortars to be reduced in size no larger or heavier than a flashlight. Accompanying a squad of soldiers equipped with his weaponry on a patrol through the jungle, he accidentally triggers a tripwire that detonates a landmine. The wounded Stark is captured by Wong-Chu's forces and taken to their nearby headquarters. Wong-Chu realizes his prisoner is a \"famous Yankee inventor\" and decides that he will put him to work in service of the Communist insurgency even though doctors determine the young inventor only has days to live before \"shrapnel reaches his heart.\"\nWong-Chu falsely promises that he will have a surgeon save Stark's life if he will agree to develop new high-tech weapons for him. Even though he saw through Wong-Chu's words to his true intentions, to make him work until his death, Stark agrees, in order to try and save his own life with his technical abilities and Wong-Chu's resources. Given access to scrap metal and tools, Stark promises he will deliver a \"fantastic weapon,\" but sets out in building a mechanism that will help stop the shrapnel from penetrating his heart. He is given an assistant namedProfessor Yinsen, a famous physicist whom Stark had read about while in college. Working together, the two finalize work on Stark's project: an iron body suit with a chest plate that will keep the shrapnel at bay through use of transistor-powered magnets.\nJust as Stark has donned the life-saving suit and begun to power it with electrical current from a generator, Wong-Chu attempts to come check on his prisoners. Professor Yinsen rushes out into the hallway shouting at Wong-Chu and is shot dead by armed guards, buying the precious seconds Stark needed to fully charge the armor. Tony Stark, as Iron Man, hears the murder of his friend and swears he will avenge his death. He tries to rise and steady himself in the Iron Man armor, but discovers it is like learning to walk again. He quickly gets the hang of operating the armor and evades detection from Wong-Chu by leaping to the ceiling and holding himself there using suction cups. After Wong-Chu leaves the room, the tyrant heads outside to \"amuse himself\" with his favorite sport, challenging the villagers to a duel of judo.\nIron Man descends from the ceiling and finds a coat and hat, with which to cover his armor, and wanders outside to find Wong-Chu tossing people around in the judo arena. Iron Man challenges Wong-Chu, then takes off his coat and hat to reveal the shocking visage of Iron Man! The metal monster walks up to Wong-Chu, picks him up, and twirls him around before tossing him into the brush. Wong-Chu demands that his guards open fire on Iron Man, but the bullets just bounce off the armored figure's metal chest plate. Iron Man then uses \"reverse magnetism\" to repel the enemy weapons. Wong-Chu tries to get to the speakers of the nearest building, in order to put a bounty on Iron Man, but Stark manages to create electrical interference and switch the radio's channel, telling Wong-Chu's troops through the speaker to flee their leader before the Iron Man \"slays [them] all.\" Iron Man cuts down the building's door using a transistor-powered buzz-saw, but as soon as he enters the Communist menace fells him with a file cabinet loaded with rocks."

Their organization is trafficking an experimental performance enhancing drug called EMC, and they want Olaf to oversee the security of their next shipment. Face gives Olaf a file containing supply and route information. Olaf is to burn the file after reading it, as their operation has attracted the attention of the DEA. He leaves behind two twin thugs, Lloyd and Luther Luckett, to provide Olaf with some backup. At a neighboring warehouse, DEA Agents Henderson and Ortiz take photosurveillance of Face leaving Olaf’s safehouse and driving off. Henderson tells his partner they should be busting the perps instead of taking photosurveillance, but Ortiz compares their sting operation to fishing, they have to have the right lures, and the right amount of patience.\nInside the Brooklyn DEA Field Office, Ortiz and Henderson brief their task force. Their target is Condor, a private military contractor that has recently ventured into drug trafficking. Face is believed to be Condor’s second in command, Olaf has been with Condor since he left the Marines. Nothing less than a preemptive strike will work, they do not want the conflict spilling into the streets.\nThe DEA is not the only one interested in Condor. The Punisher has eavesdropped on their surveillance, and he works through the night, assembling the weapons he will need to raid the warehouse himself.\nAs Olaf cleans his M9 service pistol, the Lucketts inquire as to why he still carries such an antiquated firearm, as they are constantly swapping out their weapons for the latest high tech upgrades. Olaf tells them that his gun has proven reliable countless times, and failing to show respect to any weapon will get them on the wrong end of it.  Their argument is interrupted by an explosion. Olaf immediately realizes the explosion to be the work of the Punisher, who he served with in the Marines. While Lloyd leaves to find Face, Olaf executes Luther and walks away without securing Face’s file.\nThe Punisher, armed with a Desert Eagle and an M16, begins shooting up their production center. One of the workers bites open an EMC packet and swallows its contents, giving him glowing red eyes and superhuman strength. He charges at Castle, shrugging off a normally fatal gunshot wound, and overpowers him, eager to be the man who takes out the Punisher. Castle gouges out his assailants eyes with his thumbs, then impales him with rebar. He then hits the thug with a cinderblock, knocking him into a fuse box, fatally electrocuting him. Castle proceeds to use the cinderblock on the only surviving worker, but Olaf dispatches the thug before Castle can deal the killing blow. Olaf reveals that he has little love for Condor’s drug trafficking operation, everything he needs to take it down is in his office. He warns Castle not to follow him, as he always has an extraction plan. Castle grudgingly allows Olaf to leave, and takes the file.\nThe next morning, the DEA task force raid the warehouse to find nothing but dead bodies. The Punisher has singlehandedly destroyed their case against Condor.\nFace kills Lloyd as a punishment for his failure, then phones Condor, informing him that the Punisher killed all of their assets in the warehouse. Condor insists that the Punisher must be eliminated before he can do any further damage to their operation, as some very powerful clients will be angry at them if EMC fails to meet its distribution date. Face assures him that he will handle it personally, as he adds Lloyd to his collection of trophies.\nFRANK CASTLE LOSES CONTROL!"

They are not actuallymutantsbut humans with enhancements given to them.[1]\nEach amongst the crew are equipped with unique ammunition stock tailored specifically to hamper the hyper regenerative abilities of more robust individuals. The slugs cost a few hundred grand per-bullet to manufacture, so discharging them recklessly is rather costly.[2]\nThe mercenary unit Strikeforce X had been manufactured by aRoxxoncorp. subsidiary known asBlackguardusing stolen Weapon X files.[3]Their services sold to politically sensitive hot zones all across the globe for a hefty sum, all of which being a long play in order to drawLoganto them so the commissioner of their creation; a Chief Executive of said PMC facilitator, can present evidence of termination to ready & waiting military figures on top of the shareholders at his next board meeting.[2]\nThe true purpose of this new private militia was to show off a living weapons test, using dishonorably discharged army renegades as viable test subjects whom the executive would deploy to volatile case areas touched by Roxxon or any other developmental contractors with deep pockets and black souls to serve whatever grizzly ends they need to meet.\nAll for the general purpose of overtaking the armed forces market in the long run, generally replacing nationally coopted servicepeople with Strikeforce X platoons in a bid to push a massive multi-governmental spanning contract. Making them the de-factor military of the USA by a half decades end.[4]\nSuch plans were eventually stymied indefinitely by the intervention of Nord, Wolverine and the published article of oneMelita Garnerwhich exposed Blackguards amoral dealings under the table to the wider public. All while Wolverine dispatched what remained of the Chief's remaining forces by blasting the oilrig they'd all been waiting on in the middle of the ocean, taking advantage of the buoyancy deficiency the mercs new modifications come with to finish most of them in one fell swoop. Meanwhile, Maverick would find the whistleblower whom he'd sold the files to that were used in creating Strikeforce X and cutting him down as punishment for his misdeeds. On top of covering his own tracks in the long run.[5]"

After its reactivation, Flipside created a new form based on Miguel. It became obsessed with Spider-Man, but after he rejected the android, Flipside sought to kill him instead. He also inherited one of his predecessor's rogues, theVenom Symbiote. Venom's new host wasKron Stone, Miguel's half-brother, who had already hated him in their civilian lives. Due to multiple time-traveling adventures, Miguel has often crossed paths with thePeter ParkerofEarth-TRN461.[1]\nMiguel was recruited by theS.H.I.E.L.D.of Earth-TRN461 into theSpider-Men, a group of Spider-Man analogs assembled to combat theMultiversal Sinister Six.

He was freed by the Peter Parkervariant.[1]\nPeter Parkerto the rescue\nShortly afterward, O'Hara would return home once more at the request of his psychotic half-brother. He revealed that Goblin had also been hunting him and proposed the two team-up. The team-up didn't last long; however, with Venom attacking Spider-Man. The two were separately confronted by Goblin informant, Flipside, who tried to partner with both of them and failed, leading to a three-way fight.[1]\nEscaping from 2099, O'Hara was found by Spider-Man 2014, who gave him on a newSpider-Armorand guided him back to his reality.

While theNew Avengerswere fighting asymbioteoutbreak inManhattan, Hood used aDeathlokto rob a bank inNew Jersey, then used the proceeds as seed money to recruit a large number of supervillains. As luck would have it, a recent breakout had left most of the villains free, but struggling to get by, so his offer was well-received.[5]\nWith a close council of advisors and enforcers, Hood led his people in a fight againstLuke Cage'sNew Avengers, which he lost through the actions ofDoctor Strange. However, the Hood was able to use his magic gear to get them out of jail quickly.[6]\nThe group was active during theSkrullsSecret Invasion, where they sided with the other human heroes against the aliens.[7]As Hood's syndicate was attacking the Skulls, it was revealed that they had known there were Skrulls in hiding as Skrull agents had tried to replaceMadame Masquebut failed. When advised to use his magic to scan the villains present, Hood discovered thatSlughad been replaced by a Skrull and killed him.[8]\nIn the wake of this, the group began to benefit from their leader's alliance withNorman Osborn,[4]the new American homeland security czar and head of theS.H.I.E.L.D.replacement known asH.A.M.M.E.R.. In this new environment, the organization consolidated its control of the New York criminal underworld, and began to spread in new directions: sending members to join theInitiative[3]and also tried to control the zombie virus.[9]At the same time they continued to face opposition from rebel heroes such as the New Avengers[10][11]and thePunisher,[12]and even from independent villains, likeEnforcer[13]andMister Negative.[14]\nDuring this time,Jonas Harrow, a high-ranking member of the group, found the remains of a device intended to nullify superpowers, and rebuilt it, able to include or exclude people from its effect. When the Hood lost his powers and had to go on a journey to recover them, Harrow struck, taking control of the gang and fighting the New Avengers and Osborn's \"official\"Avengersteam. When Hood got back, he killed Harrow and retook the group.[15]\nIn the wake of this, the group became part of Norman Osborn's plan to invade Asgard, with the promise of government-mandated immunity from prosecution for all members if they were successful.[16]Unfortunately, due to a combination of plans coming to fruition, the invasion was thwarted, and in the confusion, the group's members were all either arrested or had to flee, and the group's power was spent.[17]\nYears later, The Hood took a second shot at becoming the new kingpin of New York following Wilson Fisk's exit from the underworld.[18]After the fall of Kingpin runner-upDiamondbackat the hands of theDefenders, The Hood grabbed hold of his territory and operations. He reunited many former members of his old army, and intended to form a new alliance, dividing New York in territories and assigning one supervillain to act as said territory's indisputable kingpin. Even though the meeting was interrupted by the Defenders and numerous of their allies,[19]the reformation of The Hood's army moved forward. One of their first actions consisted on targetingVictor von Doom, who had turned a new leaf and had become the newIron Man.[20]"

The \"priest\" revealed himself to be the Hood before the Punisher was enraged and attempted to kill him before breaking down a door and finding himself in his family home. He was surprised to see that Maria and his children were all alive and grown up.\nAfter kissing Maria and hugging his children, Lisa wanted to introduce him to \"someone special\" and it was the Hood. The Punisher pinned the Hood to a wall and told him not to touch his daughter, although the Hood claimed that he couldn't \"until he allowed him to bring them back.\" When the Punisher turned around, they were \"all dead as doornails\" and he threw the Hood through a door before the two were surrounded by dead bodies. The Hood told him that without the love of his family to his desire to kill, his future was only the dead bodies around them.\nHenry woke Frank up inside of a trailer of a truck full of computers and told him about a shipment of drugs coming in. Frank told him to find a target with a bloody history although Henry insisted that he didn't kill anybody. Then, Frank responded by pinning him against a wall before Henry shoved him away before he was told to \"pack up and go\" if he didn't like how \"his business\" was done. After the Punisher left, Henry angrily smashed one of his screens with his chair and thought that if he ever laid a hand on him again, it would be the last time.\nMeanwhile, Megatak was helping Microchip locate the Punisher and find out who his hacker was and Mirage argued with Letha and Titania, both who were given new powers by the Hood, before the latter of the two women used her new power to induce desire in him. Mind-Wave threatened Letha before she caused Cyclone to attack him with her new power of aggression inducement. Then, Letha told the rest that it was time to \"step it up\", that the Punisher and every other vigilante in New York would be dead, and that the city would be theirs. At the Bar With No Name, Basilisk and Death Adder chained G.W. Bridge and successfully convinced him to agree to capture the Punisher alive for them after threatening Tyler.\nThe Punisher shot and killed the Wraith with a bow and arrow when he was alone at night before Henry gave him Bird-Man's location. Nearby, the Human Fly was eating a woman named Tina before a Black Stream squad confronted him, only to be killed. Then, the Punisher appeared in front of him and challenged him.\nhttp://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12335"

His family life was unstable growing up ashis motherbecame addicted to Total Reality simulations whilehis fatherabandoned her to marry a muchyounger woman. Paul-Philip sued his parents for independence as a teenager and won, creating a lifelong rift between him and his family.\nAs a young man, Ravage fought in the Pollution Wars along withAlec Dupledge. The international MegaCorps manipulated public opinion to make the American people believe the federal government was in the pocket of national corporations, spreading pollution throughout the world. A new American revolution began when the \"eco-friendly\" MegaCorps gathered an army to overthrow the \"polluters\" running the country. Ravage believed strongly in the environmental message of the MegaCorps, and emerged as a hero of the Pollution Wars during the final siege of the President's forces.\nA new Corps-run Congress emerged in the aftermath of the Pollution Wars, and Paul-Philip was given a cushy position as head ofEco Central,Alchemax's anti-pollution division. The \"pollution police\" made polluting a terrorist-level crime, punishable by death or worse, exile to the radioactive island wasteland known asHellrock. In reality, Eco Central was just another excuse for Alchemax and the MegaCorps to create a police state with the public's approval, painting any dissidents or undesirables as \"polluters\" before eliminating them.\nRavage possessed various superhuman abilities as a result of genetic surgery and exposure to radioactive materials.\nOriginal Powers\nEnergy Blasts:Ravage's first superhuman ability, the one he gained through surgical means, is the ability to project concussive blasts of bio-kinetic energy from his hands. The maximum amount of force these blasts generated is unknown, though they could easily deform solid steel.\nHowever, Ravage could only fire these blasts for a few minutes as he was essentially using his own energy for the blasts. As a result, the blasts were physically very taxing on his own system and overuse of them could have been fatal. After being exposed to radioactive materials, Ravage lost this ability but gained others in its place.\nPowers via Radioactive Mutation\nSuperhumanly Acute Senses:Ravage's natural human senses were augmented to levels well beyond the natural capabilities of an ordinary human. He could see at a greater distance, and with perfect clarity, than a normal human. He was also able to see perfectly in near-total darkness, possibly even into the infra-red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Ravage's hearing was also enhanced, allowing him to detect sounds a much greater distances than normal humans. He was also able to hear sounds, such as extremely high pitch vibrations, that ordinary humans can't detect. His sense of smell was extremely developed and enabled him to detect an object by scent. He was able to discern organic scents from chemical compounds left by mechanical devices and track them over great distances.\nSuperhuman Strength:Ravage's musculature, connective tissues and skeletal structure were augmented to levels beyond that of normal human limits. As a result, Ravage was superhumanly strong and, at his peak, could lift approximately 70 tons.\nSuperhuman Agility:Ravage's agility, balance and bodily coordination were enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits and capabilities of the finest human specimen.\nSuperhuman Reflexes:Ravage's reflexes were similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human specimen."

Miguel O'Hara then assumed the role of C.E.O. full time.[26]\nAfter unrevealed circumstances, Tyler Stone regained control of Alchemax, ready to face a temporal alteration which caused Stone's very existence and the whole 2099 A.D. timeline to cease. Scientists at Alchemax created time travel technology, to find the source of disruptions in the timestream. Discovering the problem to be originating from theHeroic Age, they convinced Spider-Man to travel to 2013 A.D.. Once the timeline was secure, Tyler had his scientist destroy their time machine, abandoning Spider-Man in the past.[27]\nSeveral Alchemax facilities were raided by theSuperior Spider-Manfor technology relating toVirtual Unreality.

Calling himself Flipside, the deranged android begins hugging Spider-Man in a death grip. This is witnessed by the deranged scavengers known as the Looters. They are delighted because they believe that Flipside is bonding with the masked hero. When Spider-Man pushes Flipside off of him and calls him a psycho, Flipside begins to cry. When one of the Looters tries to comfort the android, flipside responds by cutting his throat. He then turns his attention to Spider-Man.\nBack in New York, Dana D'Angelo is out to dinner with Alchemax CEO Tyler Stone. Tyler is manipulating Dana into trusting him, by admitting that Miguel probably told her a lot of bad things about him. Dana recalls how Miguel claimed that Tyler intentionally addicted him to the drug known as Rapture. He tells her that Miguel was interested in designer drugs and he gave him a non-addictive variant to give O'Hara a bad trip and steer him off drugs.[Continuity 1]Dana wonders if it really worked, pointing out that Miguel has been acting strangely for some time. Tyler explains that people often drift apart. He mentions the death of his wife Nancy, and the murder of his son Kron at the hands of the vigilante known as the Punisher.[Continuity 2]Tyler admits that he is lonely and that he is attracted to her, even though he is her senior. Dana isn't put off by this, but is confused and needs time to sort out how she feels about it. Tyler then suggests that they sort it out together. As the talk, they are unaware that they are being spied upon by Conchata O'Hara, Miguel's mother.\nBack at the Looter's hideout, their leader Packrat is upset that Flipside killed one of his men. Meanwhile, Spider-Man goes over the computer records on the android to learn what he can in the hopes of finding out a way to shut it down, because the machine's artificial intelligence has degraded. Flipside realizes what the hero is doing and smashes the computer before he can learn a way to shut the Adaptoid down. Flipside decides he will kill Spider-Man, however when he lunges at the hero, Spider-Man leaps out of the way. The force of his lung sends Flipside into the next room where Packrat and the Looters have gathered and they begin opening fire on the android. The bullets do little to stop Flipside who angrily lashes out at the Looters. As his captors are being slaughtered, Spider-Man leaves them to deal with the problem on their own. Meanwhile, Gabriel O'Hara and Kasey Nash arrive in their hotel room in Mexico City. There, Gabriel tries to explain to her that he is not really Spider-Man. However, Kasey strips off her clothing, telling him that whatever he wants to talk about can wait until later.\nAt that moment, Flipside is about to kill Packrat when Spider-Man stops him, even though he doesn't really like the man. In response, Flipside forces Spider-Man's head into his chest to trap him while it begins thrashing the hero. Flipside tells Spider-Man to let go and accept his looming demise. At first, Spider-Man considers giving in but refuses to die like this. Ripping himself free, Spider-Man also rips out Flipside's main power cable. Although the android is able to reroute his power, he needs it back in order to remain operational. When Flipside rushes at him, Spider-Man wraps the power chord around the android's neck and uses it to throw him into a bunch of computer banks. This shorts out the android, deactivating it. Packrat is delighted but threatens to kill Spider-Man anyway. Unphased by this threat, Spider-Man orders Packrat to move. Surprisingly, this demand works and he allows the hero to leave unopposed. As Spider-Man leaves the lair of the Looters, Packrat watches through he monitors. While the hero has his back turned, Packrat orders his men to mobilize to hunt down and kill. However, when he turns he discovers that Flipside is still operational and has killed the rest of his men. Flipside tells Packrat to start running but within moments his screams can be heard echoing throughout the facility.\nReturning to the ruins of Nightshade, Spider-Man changes back to Miguel O'Hara. He is happily reunited with Xina. After making some excuses for his absence during the attack on the city, he learns that Angela died. Xina blames Spider-Man for not doing enough to save her life, thinking that the hero is overrated. After burying Angela, Xina wants to go home, but Miguel isn't ready to go home yet. He is still insistent on continuing onward, even when Xina points out that he is running from his problems again. Seeing that she is not getting through to him. Xina walks away, telling Miguel that she see him later.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nVehicles:\nAfter a violent incident with Krong Stone, Miguel O'Hara is asked to speak at the council meeting to have the unruly bully expelled. However, Miguel is too afraid to speak up. Angela leaves Xina to try and talk sense into Miguel. However, O'Hara refuses to participate thinking that Kron Stone's father, Tyler, won't allow his son to be kicked out of school. He thinks that he doesn't have any power over the situation and that he is only going to be made a fool of. Xina insists that Miguel needs to do what is right.\nThinking this over, Miguel thinks about what may happen, fearing that Tyler Stone could fire his father and have them evicted from their home in retaliation. Later, Xina appears before the council to tell her side of the story. Hearing this, Tyler Stone insists that her accounting of the situation are allegations and nothing more. Angela Daskalakis insists that they wait for Miguel O'Hara, who witnessed the situation, unaware that Miguel has run away from the school and is hitchhiking along the road.\nBugaboo"

Five teens cruise the skies above the city in their Whisper 3000 hovercar. They don't expect any trouble from the local \"fly-boys\" inPublic Eye-- the cross winds at their altitude are vicious. They're surprised when the fly-boys do show up, in pursuit of a black- and red-clad figure: Spider-Man! He evades them, eventually going into freefall, crashing into officer Estavez as he makes his escape into the crowd below.\nBack at his apartment,Miguel O'Harastumbles into his apartment. He is greeted byLyla, his holographic digital assistant, who notifies him of six holo messages. The first is from his boss,Tyler StoneatAlchemax, who strongly suggests he give in to the drug he's fighting and come in to the office. The next is from his brother,Gabe, who despite his contempt for the \"Corporate Raider\" program Alchemax has him working for, makes an effort to reach out to his brother for support. Miguel cuts the message short, moving on to one from his fiance,Dana D'Angelo. Her right eye is swollen shut. She says the night she saw him strung out on drugs was one of the scariest of her life, but no she's even more frightened for him. He seems to have just dropped off the face of the Earth.... Miguel cuts off the recording, and doesn't bother to watch the other three she left. Even Lyla notes his unusual behavior as \"not within normal programming parameters\": he comes and goes at different hours, his heart rate is up, he hasn't made an entry in his journal in five days....\nMiguel decides to rectify that last point by recording all that has lead up to his present condition, beginning in the laboratories of Alchemax.  Miguel O'Hara, one of the corporation's \"great hopes\", a genius given the \"full university treatment\" by the corporation itself, had been installed as the project head of a new genetics program. This led to friction with the higher-rankingAaron Delgato, who saw Miguel as arrogant, spoiled, and lacking any respect for the existing command structure. Miguel certainly had no respect for Delgato, who he treats like an idiot, but felt entirely justified by the remarkable progress of the project. They'd had remarkable success in altering the genetic structure of test animals, and he'd even found \"some quality research material for inspiration\". Miguel introduces Aaron to a file onSpider-Man, one of the greats of the turn-of-the-century Age of Heroes -- and, with the proportionate strength, speed, and agility of a spider, a perfect example of what the Corporate Raider program hopes to achieve through genetic engineering. Unfortunately for Miguel, Alchemax is interested in results -- quickly. Tyler Stone makes a trip to the lab in person to introduce the researchers toMr. Sims, a convict who volunteered for the program in exchange for a commuted 40-year sentence. Miguel protests that they are nowhere near ready for human test subjects, but Stone and Sims both insist that he give his best effort.\nMiguel starts with the simplest genetic modification he can devise, which would ideally give Mr. Sims augmented Strength. He is partially successful: when Miguel opens the transformation chamber only a horribly disfigured creature remains, but it breaks it's bonds effortlessly and nearly chokes Miguel to death before falling dead from shock.  Stone is prepared to called the results \"very positive.\" Miguel is prepared to resign.\nAt first, Stone appears to accept Miguel's decision. He even offers Miguel a goodbye toast of vintage 1994 wine in his office and tells him that any company that calls asking about him will only get the most glowing reviews. He does, however, see a problem with how Miguel will acquire \"Rapture\". You see, Rapture is a legal, mind-expanding, hallucinogenic drug sold only through Alchemax. Outrageously expensive, it also bonds to the user's genetic code, making the withdraws symptoms lethal. Stone had just doped Miguel's wine with Rapture as \"a parting gift\".[Continuity 1]In a stupor, Miguel stumbles out of Stone's office. By the time he arrives home his trip has turned nasty. As he enters his apartment, he lashes out at his fiance, who appears at first to be some sort of monster. Miguel is sorry and explains the situation to her: even if he chooses not to be a slave for Alchemax, he will still be a life-long addict.\nMiguel O'Hara, transformed\nMiguel sees only one chance to escape his fate: he had saved his genetic structure to use as a sample in the Corporate Raider program. He had been imprinting his structure on to apes, but if he can survive the process he might be able to revert back to his pre-drugged genetic structure. As he seals himself into the transformation chamber lab that night, Miguel believes he is alone. In fact, Aaron Delgato had been watching unseen, and decided to take this chance to rid himself of the arrogant upstart. Wildly changing control settings, Delgato never notices that he sets the machine to merge Miguel's un-altered DNA with that of a spider. Overriding all safety warnings, Delgato pushes the machines beyond their normal limits, and they explode violently. Afterward, Delgato is surprised to find Miguel has survived, and is stumbling dazed around the lab. Delgato decides to play off his involvement in the accident, telling Miguel that he's going to pay for damaging so much Alchemax equipment... and notices too late what kind of fanged, clawed creature Miguel O'Hara has become.\nA flashback in this story affects the chronology of the following characters:"

Jake Gallows specialized in weapons. He had a wife,Anji, and a son,Dean, but they eventually broke up. Anji left with her son when she discovered, using her divination, that Jake would one day become a vigilante, saying instead that he spent more time with the Public Eye than with his family. He eventually missed his own son's funeral after he died during a military operation.\nOne day, the son ofAlchemax'sVice President,Kron Stoneand his gang murdered hismother, brother andsister-in-law. He was himself seriously injured.\nAfter recovering, Jake, disgusted by the sentence for Stone, had come across and stolen, from the Public Eye, archives of the originalPunisher'sWar Journal.[6]The last page bore the challenge: \"You who find this, I charge you to carry on my work.\" Soon after, he became the new Punisher.\nUnder his new vigilante identity, Jake seemingly killed Stone, but decided to continue his rampage and collaborate with his sidekickMatt Axelon an arsenal, a prison (the Punishment Hotel), and a Molecular Disintegration device to terminate unrepentant criminals.[1]\nHe confronted, on a few occasions, theCyber Nostra. Once while defending a hero-costumed crowd during the Heroes Day. There, he learned fromBarrio Manthe meaning of the faith people kept in Heroes Age values.[7]On the second time, he killed the Cyber-Nostra enforcer,Multi-Fractor, as well as some corrupt Public Eye cops. Seeing he had became a cop-killer, he swore to kill theFearmaster.[8]\nAt a point, he crossed the way of theYoung Blades gang, young killers using Sword Blades as vehicles. Led by the decredMaxine Sands, who called herself \"Blue Max\", carrier of the Blue Dagger, an exceptional Jet Blade. First trying to kill them under his Public Eye's agent identity, Jake was stopped by hisChief. He then wore the Punisher's mantle to terminate them.\nKilling all his friends, Jake confronted Maxine. Blue Max tried to explain her reasons, but the Punisher was thinking only about punishment. Claiming nobody has ever given her anything, she preferred suicide instead of allowing the Punisher to give her death. Jake feels uncomfortable about her suicide. Knowing that Maxine was not solely responsible for her behavior, because she was a product of her society.[9]\nShe was saved by her fellow Blade,Sky Boy,[10]who was later captured and killed by the Punisher.[11]\nA special agent,Kerry Dowenn, was sent to investigate possible subjects who might be the Punisher.[12]Her evidence pointed to Jake, but she refused to turn him in to her superiors. The two became lovers, after Jake revealed to her he was indeed the Punisher, and Jake was about to give up his vigilante identity to live a happy life with her.\nWhile Matt Axel and Jake Gallows were on a mission to saveDegensfrom Alchemax and the Church of the Flying Identified Object, the Fearmaster attacked Kerry trying to obtain the data that pointed to Jake Gallows as the Punisher. She deleted the disk before giving it to the Fearmaster, and in retaliation the Fearmaster transmuted her into glass.[13]Her fragile form shattered in Jake's arms, causing him to become even more unstable. He seemed to separate his being the Punisher and Jake Gallows into two different personalities.\nHe start using the Molecular Disintegrator on a larger scale. Graham Jones, aka Sky Boy, from the Young Blades gang, was one of the many criminals to be terminated in this way.[11]\nMulti-Fractor was later revived by a mortician surgeon as Jigsaw. He tried to attract the Punisher's attention, who managed to capture him, but was needed by the Chief before having the time to terminate him on the Molecular Disintegrator.\nThe Chief's mission consisted of checking the security details on the floating city ofValhalla, created by Alchemax. Looking for security failures, he foundRavage, the Beast-Man, whom he targeted for being a cop-killer.\nThe two of them briefly fought, before retreating.[14][15]\nThe two of them were forced to work together among the other heroes (Doom,Spider-Man, and theX-Men) during theFall of the Hammer.\nThe Punisher would help to bring down thefalse Norse Gods, killing bothHeimdallandBaldur(after an hesitation, thinking of his Thorite family, and especially to his brother, named after the god he was about to kill) and striking the final blows againstThor. Then helping to prevent Valhalla from falling onNew York City.\nAvatarrwarned him before disappearing that he will eventually be in the chair with the Molecular Disintegrator.[16]\nAt some time, he also checked the security of the Sky-Liner, a gigantic floating city created byStark-Fujikawa, this time as the Punisher. The ship was attacked by the skyjackers, mercenaries hired by Alchemax, whereupon they were all killed by him.\nFearmaster was able to track Jigsaw to the Punishment Hotel and attack the Punisher. He then tried to kill him using the Molecular Disintegrator, but the fail-safe targeted Jigsaw, who disappeared and was left for dead. The Fearmaster then retreated to the Temple of the Flying Identified Object, where the Punisher targeted him. Using Fearmaster's hand, he changed him into mud and let him there in the Endymion Room, renamed the Punishment Room by Jake, with his precedent victims.\nAt the same time,Saber Hagen, a Degen super-soldier (Red Dog) issued from an Alchemax project, starts to kill massive crowds. Becoming sick of the passivity of the people for the laws and injustice. Thinking the Punisher would appreciated his actions and team-up, he presented himself, under the name of Public Enemy, and massacred a crowd of people in front of him. Matt Axel managed to convince Punisher not kill Public Enemy. Public Enemy later confronted him after having seen him leave the Degen Hostel (a foundation run by Matt). Even after allowing a crowd to start fighting Public Enemy considered then his mission accomplished.\nThe Punisher went to kill Matt, considering he had betrayed him by hiding Saber and also for providing him an unload gun with which to confront Public Enemy. While in a psychotic state Jake stated that the Punisher personality had taken control of him and stopped his attack on Matt.\nAt Public Eye he is teamed-up withGold Heart(a highly evolved robot cop who appears to be the gold-stealing murderer vigilante known as Gold Ghoul). Visiting his flat with some doubt about the relation between the murderer and the cop he confronts him about it. Even though he suspicions were correct he ends up helping him escape Public Eye Internal Inquiries agents instead. It seems that the agents had discovered his secret identity and come to take him in.. Gold Heart's body was destroyed, but his program was inserted into Jake's bike.\nVisiting the New-U Clinic, a clinic specializing in the mind-transfer of rich people into decreeds' bodies, to destroy it, he encounters a female Punisher previously signalled by Gold Heart,Vendetta. They teamed-up to destroy the Clinic. When they finally found Vendetta's ex-owner, who named her \"Polly\", she shot him with Incendigel, letting him burn, while Punisher terminated him, to avoid more suffering.\nThey argued on the way to punish. She was shot by a laser beam from Public Eye's flyboys, but Jake Gallows managed to take her to his place. After letting her heal, he propose to gave up his secret identity and let her take the role, offering the responsibility of his Hotel Punishment and arsenal to her, on the condition that she pass Jake's test: use the molecular disintegrator on a prisoner. She did, and realizing the psychotic nature of the Punisher, she then decided to quitNew Yorkand goes to space to save Gene Dolls. She kept in contact with Punisher.[17]\nThe Punisher later confronted the masked thief, Hotwire, who was his presumed-dead sonDean Gallows, mutated after an accident during his time in the Alchemax'sTen Minute Club. Blaming him for having be more concerned by his job than his family, he tried to steal all his money in the bank, but was stopped by the Punisher. They fought, but neither of them unmasked.\nEnquiring on multiples suicides and accidents cases, Jake Gallows was the target of multiple bad-luck events. He was revealed bySynchron the Synner, fromEarth-93124, that he was the target of his counterpart,Synchron the Strange Attractorand the antidote created by the nature to destroy him, as his own alternate counterpart,Jake Gallows, head of thePunishment Police. Jake briefly saw him when Synchron the Synner was called back to his reality, before go in Synchron the Strange Attractor and defeated him. The two of them fell from an anti-grav ship and Synchron impaled on a graveyard fence.\nAll the town began act in a crazy and violent way, including the Punisher. This was caused byManitou's hypnotic waves, a scientist would-be God, using the energy of death and violence to increase him. Gold Heart manage to dissipate the effects of the hypnosis with the help of Matt Axel. Jake intended to kill Manitou but he informed him that was his intention to die, his plan to ascend as a God was to die and resurrect with the energies collected. He uses his waves of hypnosis to gather all the city to kill him. Breaking into an Alchemax facility, The Punisher put Manitou into a particles accelerator to annihilate both his body and soul, in the same way that nuclear weapons erase the souls.\nTracking a Cyber-Nostra's gang, the Punisher found on the Air Gladiator/Blue Dagger championship, confronting a returned Blue Max. He tried to kill her and win the game to discredit this dangerous and murderous sport but fails both, while Max was trying to avenge her fall comrade and adversary, the Samuraï, and her friend of the Young Blades. He swore there will no other chance for her to live on their next encounter.\nUltimately, Jake would become the first law enforcer underDoom's administration, as the Minister of Punishment, head of thePunishment Police, Federal Law Enforcement for theUnited States.[18]As Doom's minister, he will apply his brutal justice against the Black-carders and the Cyber-Nostra (even their lawyers), but attire to him the hate of his fellow ally, the now paranoid Matt Axel.[18]\nThis one rebuilt Gold Heart as a Punisher robot to kill his former friend. Jake started to act as a furious to kill Matt and his robot, and was quickly seen as a menace by Doom, thanks toOfficer Saffron, Doom's liaison into the SHIELD. On Doom's orders and using an hologram of the Punisher, she managed to made him look gone off track.[19]\nHelped by the SHIELD agentJillian Wong, he managed to escape from Earth using Matt Axel's escape way. He was sent to a space station run by criminals, and went on a rampage. He then go out, just before her fellow partner, Vendetta, shot the station using a forgotten Alchemax's designed gunship she found in space.[20]\nThe two Punishers fight an instant, under oxygen-lack. Recovering, they made an arrangement: they finally teamed-up. Jake Gallows will return on Earth, directing for Vendetta the strikes of her giant gunship, to erase evil from the world.[21]\nJake Gallows died during Doom's fall against the forces ofJohn Herod. Tracked by SHIELD's agents, like all the heroes, underPresident Steve Rogers' orders. He furiously defended his life, killing many agents, before being terminated by a wave-spider. His death was recorded byNyFax's reporter,Mirielle Radley.[22]He was briefly interviewed before this by NyFax too, telling he was intending to \"cut Rogers' skin off\".[23]\nAfter some glitches in thetimestream, the events of the year 2099 changed under unspecified circumstances and everything that happened after theAtlanteansinvasion was cancelled from the timeline. In this new timeline, the Punisher was alive and was contacted bySpider-Manwhen he andLady Spidertraveled back to 2099 A.D. in order to dissect the cloned body of theInheritorDaemosfor clues on how to defeat his brethren. At the same time, they had captured the new Daemos and locked him up in a stasis, but this wasn't able to hold him like Miguel originally thought. Daemos used the field to his advantage, killing himself so another clone could be transported back there with his essence uploaded into it to finish off the two spiders.\nPunisher vs. Daemos\nAs Daemos made his way toAlchemax, he was blasted off his flying vehicle by the Punisher. Gallows confronted Daemos with his advanced weapons dealing a good amount of damage to the Inheritor, going as far as beating him repeatedly in the face with aTitanium Batand using a plasma gas cannon to burn the ground causing Daemos to fall through. Gallows' distraction gave Spider-Man and Lady Spider ample time to transport back to thespider safe zone.[24]\nWarden\nWhen theElders of the Universevisited the remains of the reality known asBattlerealm, they decided to partake in aContest of Championsto determine who was to keep the powerfulISO-Spherefound in this universe. Punisher was the champion chosen by theThe Grandmasterfrom across theMultiverse.\nUpgraded by Maestro\nMany waged battles later, Gallows andMaestrowere the finalists. With ulterior motives in mind, they offered the Elders each represented (Grandmaster andThe Collector) to become their right hands and put in motion a new Contest of Champions. Thus, Punisher and Maestro became their summoners, choosing new warriors from across the Multiverse.\nWhen the Contest reached its conclusion, and the Collector saw himself with the majority of the ISO-Sphere in his possession, Maestro and Punisher betrayed their masters. Maestro got hold of the ISO-Sphere and became the god-king of Battlerealm, with Gallows becoming his right hand, and executioner and warden of the contestants.[25]Punisher began to show disgust for Maestro, realizing that he killed for joy rather than punishment.\nFace Scrambler:and a 'face scrambler' that helps him avoid detection.

The base contains a prison, which he uses to temporarily detain and interrogate prisoners.[27]\nExo-muscular Undersuit:Jake's suit gives him enhanced strength and agility, body armor.

He marriedNancy Herod, daughter of an powerfulAlchemaxExecutive,Anthony Herod, for additional wealth or power, and theirs was a mostly loveless marriage.[6][7]Nancy's father, Anthony Herod, held an high-ranking position at Alchemax, and someone evoking his name was one of the few things that could give Tyler pause.[2]Around the time Nancy gave birth to their son,Kron, Tyler was having an affair withConchata O'Hara, wife of one ofhis employees. Conchata became pregnant and gave birth to Tyler's illegitimate son,Miguel O'Hara, who was raised without knowing who his biological father was. Only Tyler and Conchata knew the secret at first, but Nancy admitted she knew the truth to Conchata when Miguel was a teenager, and the two women inexplicably bonded over their poor taste in men.[7]Later, Conchata once hinted that Tyler was responsible for his wife's demise, and she had evidence she could turn over to Anthony Herod if anything ever happened to her.[4]\nAt some point, Tyler become employed byAlchemax Corporation, serving as a Director at the company'sExecutive Board, chaired by the reclusiveChief Executive Officer,Avatarr.[8]As the corporation's Vice President in charge of the Research & Development Department,[9]Stone headed several projects, including theCorporate Raider Program,[10]theNova Atlanteaundersea colony and theAres Colony Project, originally codenamedMars One.[11]\nEventually, Miguel O'Hara grew up to become a geneticist working for Tyler at Alchemax on theCorporate Raider Program. When Miguel developed a troubling conscience over human testing, Tyler seemingly had Miguel addicted to the highly potent drug 'Rapture'. Since Alchemax controlled the distribution of Rapture, Tyler was confident Miguel would stay on the program to ensure his supply. Miguel's efforts to rid himself of the addiction using Corporate Raider technologies ended up giving himSpider-Powers, and making him a thorn in Alchemax's side asSpider-Man.[5]Tyler initially told Miguel he had identified Spider-Man as another employee,Aaron Delgato, although there were hints that Tyler knew Miguel's identity even from the beginning. Miguel agreed to return to Alchemax in order to keep access to the tech that made him Spider-Man, in the hopes of reversing it.[12]\nThen, Tyler decided to hireStark-Fujikawa Corporation's assassin known as theSpecialistto kidnapKasey Nashin order to lure Spider-Man into battle. However, during the battle against Spider-Man, his throat was accidentally slit as Miguel discovered his new powers included talons.[13]\nTyler's sonKron Stone, chronically neglected and physically abused by the family's robot nanny, grew up to be an amoral murderer. His serial killings took the lives ofJake Gallows' extended family, resulting in his transformation into his era'sPunisher. Kron, like many other rich people, has the ability to simply purchase his way out of any legal punishment using his Black Card credit. This did not save him from death at Jake's hands.[14]Tyler did not mourn his son's death: he simply flushed what he believes were his son's ashes down the toilet. Kron's real body had encountered and merged with a symbiotic entity believed to be the originalVenom.[15]\nMiguel later infiltrated Tyler's mansion, unexpectedly overhearing his own mother conversing with him, and learned that he was actually Tyler's biological son due to an illicit affair his mother once had with him years ago. He also discovered that theRapturedrug he was given was actually a simulated dose, simply meant to scare Miguel into staying employed by Alchemax. Miguel was never given actual Rapture, and his attempt to cure himself of the drug was unnecessary.[4]\nWhenVictor von Doomtook control of theWhite House, becoming the newPresident of the United States, he decided to organize a meeting with all of the Executives of the American MegaCorps, including Alchemax's Chief Executive Avatarr and Vice President Tyler Stone. At the meeting, Doom declared that every American corporation was going to become controlled by the President himself, then deciding to slay one of the executives gathered at the White House as a demonstration of his power. Under Tyler's advice, President Doom killed Avatarr, who revealed himself to be analien.[16]Doom then appointed Tyler as the new C.E.O. of Alchemax[17]and Corporate Minister of Megacorporations' activities at hisBlack Cabinet.[2]At the same time, Tyler was secretly working with his father-in-law, Anthony Herod, and hisChicago Reserve, in order to overthrow Doom by financing the creation of a fakeCaptain America, which would have been used by Herod as his personal puppet President.[18]\nNeeding to find a replacement Vice President of Alchemax's Research & Development Department, Tyler appointed his biological son Miguel to that position, with President Doom's approval. Returning home to his new fiancée,Dana D'Angelo, Tyler was shot by his former lover,Conchata O'Hara.[2]With Tyler hospitalized at Nueva York'sSt. Teresa Hospital, Miguel became Alchemax's acting C.E.O. at the request of President Doom.[19]When Tyler's believed-to-be-deceased son, Kron, emerged asVenom, he tried to murder his father while he was in a comatose state, being defeated by Spider-Man.[20]\nAwakening from his comatose state, Tyler tried to regain control of Alchemax from his son Miguel, who, in the meantime, has decided to remain as C.E.O. in order to use Alchemax's resources in a better way than his biological father did. Having doctors declaring Tyler as mentally unfit, Miguel then ordered security to bring Tyler out of theAlchemax Building.[21][22]\nLater, Tyler had a meeting with Conchata, now Miguel's secretary at Alchemax. Here, he was going to be killed by her, but his life was saved by Miguel himself. At that point, after admitting that he knew from the beginning that Miguel was Spider-Man, he disappeared, revealing to be only an advanced hologram.[23]\nSometime before this, a temporal anomaly altered the 2099 A.D. Timeline due to the events of the so-called \"Age of Ultron\".[24]Due to some events that happened in theHeroic Age, Tyler Stone, as well as the entire 2099 A.D. timeline was near to be destroyed. As theC.E.O.ofAlchemax,[25]he ordered his men to find a solution to correctly restore the timeline. After having seenSpider-Man's presence in the past, they decided to send him to the Heroic Age to avoid a Temporal Paradox. Since he wanted his timeline to be fixed, Tyler accepted to send his arch-enemy to the past.[26]After Spider-Man had found the source of the anomalies to be Tyler's fatherTiberius Stone,[27]Tyler blocked him in the past, destroying the time device Alchemax had used to send him back in time.[28]\nWhen the temporal anomaly occurred in the year 2099, theSpider-Manof the Heroic Age was temporarily sent to the future to replace Miguel O'Hara, who had been blocked to the past. There, the so-calledSuperiorSpider-Man started to steal MegaCorporations' technology to build a time portal; after he had successfully entered theAlchemax Building, Tyler employedVentureto kill him.[29]\nWhenMiguel O'Hara(theSpider-Manof 2099 A.D.),the Six-Armed Spider-ManandLady Spiderended up in 2099 searching for theInheritorDaemos, Tyler and his assistantWinstonhelped the threeSpider-Mengiving them an Alchemax laboratory to study the Inheritors'cloning process. However, Tyler also acquired the schematics for an interdimensional portal device created by Lady Spider.[30]"

Not knowing where he is or how he got there, the wall-crawler calls out for help. Thinking that they are dealing with the Spider-Man of their own era, the Public Eye officers order the web-slinger to surrender, but the masked hero refuses to do so and easily disarms the shooters. He then leaps onto the back of one of the Public Eye crafts and grabs the officer in a headlock. He asks the officer what year it is and is told that it is the year 2099. Spotting a tunnel going into the ground, Spider-Man decides to leap down the tunnel. Seeing that this leads to Downtown, the Public Eye decides to break off their hunt.\nWhile in the modern age, Miguel O'Hara wakes up exhausted after his battle with the Vulture the night before. Thinking he is in his own home he calls out for the lights to turn on. When there is no response, he then calls for Lyla, his holographic personal assistant. This wakes up Mary Jane, who is sleeping next to him, thinking that it is her husband talking.[Continuity 1]When she turns on the bedside light. When she sees Miguel O'Hara in the bed next to her, instead of Peter Parker, she screams. Miguel tries to tell her that this is some big mistake and can't answer her demands as to what happened to her husband. Grabbing his costume, Miguel goes up onto the roof hoping it is all just some dream. However, when he sees the New York City skyline he begs for himself to wake up.[Continuity 2]In some other time or place, a group of men observes the two Spider-Men as they try to make sense of their situations. Their leader tells them to keep observing, that things are going according to plan, and what happens next is up to them. In the future, Spider-Man crawls through the tunnel to Downtown, thinking that he is being punished for sneaking out to go on patrol as Spider-Man.\nIn the present, the Spider-Man of 2099 swings across the city and realizes that this is old New York, the place that is now part of Downtown in his own time. Coming across the Daily Bugle, he recalls that before the advent of the info nets of his time, news was printed on newspaper. Going into the Bugle, he explains to the reporters that he is from the future and wants to know what the news of the day is so he can figure out why he has been brought to this era. His information gathering is interrupted by publisher J. Jonah Jameson, who doesn't believe that this man is from the future, figuring that he is Spider-Man trying to play some kind of trick. With no patience for Jameson's rants, Spider-Man webs up Jonah's mouth and pushes him into a wheeled chair. Seeing how Jameson was treated by this Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle staff is even more interested in helping him. While in 2099, Hikaru-Sama of Stark-Fujikawa contacts Tyler Stone of Alchemax. He informs Stone that his company has picked up strange energy readings and reminds Tyler that if Alchemax is responsible for these readings, that such energies are illegal to experiment on. When he Hikaru asks to inspect the Alchemax facilities, Stone declines his offer. While Downtown, Spider-Man continues to try and figure out what he is doing in the future. Suddenly, his spider-sense goes off allowing him to avoid an attack from the Vulture of this era. Like many others, the Vulture mistakes Spider-Man for his counterpart in this era.[Continuity 3]Although Spider-Man easily deflects this ambush, the Vulture then starts threatening the people on the street who have gathered.[Continuity 4]Spider-Man quickly knocks out the Vulture. When the crowd approaches him, their religious fervor toward him creeps the wall-crawler out and he slips away. Climbing up the side of a building, the web-head bumps into Gabriel O'Hara, who mistakes Spider-Man for his brother, Miguel. Once he realizes that this isn't his brother, Gabriel begins to panic, but Spider-Man calms him down by asking for his help.\nIn the present, the Spider-Man of 2099 learns that a small firm called Fujikawa Industries is about to test a new energy conservation device.[Continuity 5]He realizes that what day today is, he asks for the story to be printed out so he can look into it. By this point, J. Jonah Jameson has gotten free and threatens to have Spider-Man arrested. Miguel removes his mask to try and make a point that he is from the future -- hence why he is willing to reveal his face in public. He also warns Jonah that something tragic is going to happen that will cost the lives of many unless he does something. He finishes his tirade against Jonah by telling him that in the future Spider-Man is revered as a hero, while J. Jonah Jameson is lost to obscurity. Jameson doesn't believe it. Spider-Man 2099 leaves the Daily Bugle, the group watching him from another time wait impatiently for him to notice Mary Jane coming to the Daily Bugle to look for her husband. Recognizing her, Miguel swings down and snatches Mary Jane off the ground and asks for her help. Taking her to a nearby rooftop, Spider-Man explains that he has figured out that she is the lover of this era's Spider-Man. He tries to tell her that today is the day where super-villains are going to try and take over it, causing a great cataclysm that will begin the end of the golden age of heroes. He says that of all the heroes who disappear during this time, Spider-Man is the first one. With that, Miguel pulls off his mask and he and Mary Jane officially introduce themselves to each other.\nIn the year 2099, Spider-Man is given a disguise so Gabriel can take him to Miguel's apartment. There he has Miguel's assistant Layra scan his Peter Parker to confirm who he is. Layra finds no record of Peter in her records. Although he doesn't know who he really is anymore, he still wants to get back to the present and decides Alchemax is the best place to start.[Continuity 6]While back in the present, Mary Jane is surprised to learn that Miguel was inspired by her husband to become the Spider-Man of his era. Miguel admits that he didn't want to become Spider-Man at first, but grew into the role.[Continuity 7]Suddenly, Miguel begins seeing things with his enhanced vision and realizes that the trouble at Fujikawa Industries is about to begin and puts on his costume. While in 2099, Spider-Man begins to sense a similar energy reading with his spider-sense. This energy signature is coming out of the Alchemax building. As the crisis reaches its climax, the men observing both Spider-Men are suddenly attacked by a hooded being on a glider who has been manipulating events to ensure the two Spider-Men fail their mission.\nIn the present, Spider-Man 2099 makes his way to Fujikawa where he is ambushed by Venom. Venom can sense that this is not the Spider-Man of this era, but is ill prepared for this hero's talons and lack of humor. In 2099 AD, Tyler Stone is operating a machine is tapping temporal energies from the fifth dimension. They have based this device on an invention from the modern age.[Continuity 8]However, with Hikaru coming to investigate Alchemax operations and orders the machine shut down. Unfortunately, the technicians have lost control of the device because some outside force has taken control of it. Outside, Spider-Man is scaling the side of the building when he is attacked by the Public Eye. Having no time for this, the wall-crawler goes smashing into the lab where the device is located. Looking into it, the wall-crawler thinks he can see his wife through the energy field. In the present, Mary Jane is thinking about the future, and now that she knows what is going to happen she feels that her hopes for tomorrow have been stolen from him. While at Fujikawa, Spider-Man 2099 continues to battle Venom. His villain suddenly stops fighting and flees the scene. Turning to see what scared Venom away, Spider-Man sees visions of Earth's heroes in the energy field, seeing the moments leading to the end of the heroic age.\nMiguel is pulled into the energy field by the modern Spider-Man and the pair find themselves pulled into the timestream. The two Spiders decide to forgo any fighting, realizing that they should work together. They are pulled forward in time to a future where all of humanity is in ruins. As they wonder where they are, they are ambushed by a new Hobgoblin who tells them that they are in his domain in the year 2211. He explains that he has come to create a temporal flux to destroy them with the Hobgoblin's powers, which are a combination of science and sorcery. Although the two Spider-Men try to take down the Hobgoblin, the villain is too powerful for them. Their foe then pulls out two weapons he calls Retcon Bombs, which will erase both men from history. However, before these bombs can hit their targets, the bombs are caught in the webbing of the Spider-Man of 2211 who has come to save his predecessors. The hero of 2211 then tosses the Retcon Bomb at the two flux generators. This causes both Spider-Men to be sent into the timestream again. However, this time, they are sent in different directions. Both men are curious why the other became a masked hero. They are both unsurprised when they both say they became Spider-Man because they had to. As they part ways, they compliment themselves on each others costumes.\nPeter finds himself back at his apartment, where he is happy to see his wife. While in the future, Miguel looks through the historical records and determines that history is still the same, the heroes of the modern age went missing at some point. The only difference is that the date the great cataclysm happens is no longer listed. Although Gabriel and Layla don't remember there ever being a date. Miguel remembers there was a date, but he is now starting to forget when it was. Miguel figures that the Richards Doctrine was wrong, and that the future is always in flux.[Continuity 9]While in the present, Peter Parker admits to his wife that seeing the future has convinced him that everything he does worthwhile and that his actions will impact people generations from now. Mary Jane tells Peter not to needlessly risk his life because people are counting on him.\n"

Otto's Spider-sense goes off knowing that someone is watching them from afar, which is revealed to beTiberius Stone, who masterminded this events as part of his revenge against Horizon Labs. With the news of Modell's arrest spreading fast, and even theBugleis being cautious of spreading the news.\nMeanwhile, theGoblin Kingtrains his new recruit, theGoblin Knight, who's being too anxious to jump into action against Spider-Man, only to be reprimanded by the King that it was his fault that he had to shut down his Goblin Protocols to avoid being discovered by Spider-Man, but then replies that he just gave him an idea.\nAt the Horizon Labs headquarters, the team puts \"Peter\" up to date with the charges, ranging from Harboring Criminals (Morbiusand theLizard), Hazardous Materials (Sajani'sReverseVibranium,Grady'sTime Door) andHumanExperimentation (theSpider-IslandVaccine and theAlphaIncident), but the team wonder how \"Peter\" doesn't remember, to which Otto replies that his memory has been fuzzy (implying that he didn't go through ALL ofPeter'smemories).

Wild Pack was mostly contracted toMr. Tolliver, an arms dealer and used Cable's orbiting space station,Graymalkin, as a means of teleporting, or \"body sliding\", in and out of situations. After a conflict withSilver Sable(who already had a group called the Wild Pack), the junior member of the team,Kanesuggested the name Six Pack, while drinking a beer. On a mission inAfghanistan, Six Pack learned thatStryfe, a former enemy of Cable's, was in charge of Mr. Tolliver's opium routes and they were contracted to take out theSovietarmored carriers that were in this route's way.  After a brief battle, Stryfe andA.D.A.M. Unit Zeroteleported away.  Cable scrapped the mission, much to the disliking of the team.  Angry, Mr. Tolliver sent agents to kill Six Pack, but they were defeated.  On another mission, Six Pack invaded aHydraresearch facility in search of a stolen component.  Once inside,Hammeraccidentally triggered a fail-safe andBaron von Strucker'simage appeared everywhere threatening to kill Six Pack, but they quickly retrieved the device and body slid out.  Six Pack later found-out that they were working forA.I.M..  Feeling used, Six Pack decided to go after Stryfe in Uruguay.  After entering an underground bunker, Six Pack battled their way into a control room, where Hammer began to download secret information from Stryfe onto a CD.  While waiting for the disk to finish downloading, Stryfe teleported behind Kane and grabbed his neck, demanding Hammer to give him the CD.  Before Hammer could give Stryfe the CD, Cable shot him from behind.  Stryfe grabbed the disk telekinetically and set-off a self-destruct on the bunker.  Cable teleported away, leaving Six Pack to fend for themselves. Under the rubble, Hammer became paralyzed from the neck down and Kane's arms and legs were severed.\nWhile searching forX-Force,DominofoundGrizzlyand Hammer and, at the same time, Kane, Cable, andG.W.

Cable also restored a variation of his time displacement core, TDC, the teleport matrix, which enabled him to teleport around the world. Cable accepted anyone and everyone to live in his separate floating island, after a week of tours, psychological tests and skills screenings. Several thousand of the world's greatest minds, from scientists to philosophers, philanthropists to writers, accepted Cable's invitation. Cable attempted to bring peacefulClan Askanisolutions to his people. Although his intentions were just, the governments of the world and S.H.I.E.L.D. grew weary. S.H.I.E.L.D. first sent a new team ofSix Pack, to aggressively reconnoiter Providence, but Cable showed them the city and offered them to stay. After Cable teleported to theS.H.I.E.L.D.

Next, the X-Men were sent, but after Cable spoke with his father,Cyclops, the battle stopped. At that moment, Fury contactedMr. Fantasticand asked theSilver Surferto stop Cable. The battle between Cable and the Silver Surfer vaporized sections of Providence, but they put it back together at the same time. After the Surfer blasted much of Cable's left side off, Providence began to fall.Marvel Girl, Cable's alternate reality half-sister, began to lower the island, but Cable regained control and lowered the island into the ocean.[4]\nOnce Cable was healed, he returned to Providence and received over two thousand applications for immigration a day. AfterDeadpoolkilled Haji Bin Barat, Providence had its first murder and Cable exiled him. Cable worked withPrester Johnas a chief in religious studies,Johann Kriek(formerly of Interpol) as head of security, and eventuallyBlack Boxto watch over the Infonet.[5]\nStill wary, Director Fury sentCaptain America, in the disguise of \"Roger Stevens\", to access a ground level threat of Providence. After immigrating to the island, Cap, too, loved the atmosphere and citizens. After obliging Cable in a quick battle, Cap learned that Cable had converted the Cone of Silence, a weapon that was intended to stop Providence, and Infonet into forms of telekinesis andtelepathyand returned to Fury. Once a week, the citizens would supervise all new civilian arrivals and supply transactions, with nothing coming through that had not been carefully screened by Cable's advancedfuturetechnology.

When S.H.I.E.L.D. needed a costumed \"supervillain\" to go undercover in the criminal organization called theCorporation, Frank was given a snake-themed costume and a pair of wrist-mounted electrified metal coils. Using the false identity of Frank Schlichting and the codename of \"Constrictor,\" he infiltrated the group, only to suffer a nervous breakdown and become a career criminal in earnest.[2]\nAs a result of his defection, S.H.I.E.L.D. allowed his daughter to believe that he had died. As the Constrictor, \"Schlichting\" debuted in combat against theHulk,[5]and would remain an independent mercenary and criminal after the dissolution of the Corporation. He battled numerous heroes over the years, including repeated encounters withCaptain America,Iron Fist,Luke Cage,Spider-Man, theThingand even theNFL Superpro. Although Luke Cage andNick Furyeventually uncovered Payne's former identity, he chose to retain the Schlichting alias and to allow his daughter to believe that her father was dead.[2]\nConstrictor was also invited to join theSerpent Society, who he turned down and subsequently tried to turn over to theAvengers.Anacondalater exacted revenge on him. While in the hospital recuperating from the beating, he was nearly killed by theScourge of the Underworlddisguised as a nurse, but was saved by Captain America.[6]\nHe later had a showdown with his step-father Scott McAvey, who had murdered his mother.[7]\nConstrictor later metDeadpoolas he and \"Titania\" moved in with him as his roommates. During their uncomfortable living situation, Constrictor was convinced that Titania was actually a man. It would turn out that he was right that she wasn't what she seemed; but not about her gender as Titania was revealed to actually be the mutant shapeshifter and Deadpool's former lover,Copycat.[8]\nHe joined the seventh incarnation of theMasters of Evil.[9]It was also later revealed that Constrictor had been part of a very short-lived rendition of theWizard'sFrightful Four.[10]\nAt one point he was one of the many mercs hired to killAlex Hayden, who was at this time thought to be Wade Wilson (Deadpool) although he stated that Wilson was a hard-ass so Hayden couldn't be Deadpool. Hayden then broke Constrictor's nose. He was later seen in the same issue being used, or rather his vibranium coils were used, to drag theRhinointo a river. Somehow both escaped.[11]\nFrank was next recruited byLucia von Bardasto attackNick Furyand a group of heroes who were involved in hisSecret WarinLatveriaa year earlier. The hired mercenaries were each a component of a bomb designed to destroy the city. Fury and his team were able to stop them and arrested them all including the Constrictor.[12]\nAfter a severe beating fromHercules, the Constrictor was awarded several million dollars in a lawsuit. Shortly thereafter, Constrictor was abducted from a high-society event (along withNighthawkandThe Thingand several others) byArcade. Constrictor helped the heroes and his fellow captives escape. Nighthawk, rich himself, convinced the Constrictor that with all his money there was no need to be a criminal anymore. Constrictor took this message to heart and decided to be a hero.[13]He was employed by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a member of the newSix-Pack.[14]\nConstrictor was present at an all-superhuman charity poker tournament hosted by the Thing (who also had a hand in the Constrictor's apparent reformation), where Hercules regained a large portion of the money he lost to the Constrictor in a non-tournament side game.[15]\nConstrictor was eventually recruited into theShadow InitiativebyHenry Peter Gyrich.[16]While fightingKIA, Constrictor lost both of his arms and was given mechanical arms instead.[17]\nAfterNorman Osborntook over the Initiative, Constrictor became a prominent member of the organization and a close friend of theTaskmaster. Over the course of his career there, he eventually graduated to a more managerial position and began datingDiamondback, a fellow Initiative member. They grew very close, but during the escape of a prisoner, Frank discovered that Diamondback was actually a spy forCaptain Americaand the Avengers. She did her best to assure him that her love was real, and Frank decided to keep her secret because he was afraid she might be hurt.[18]\nDuring the events of Siege, Frank fought for Osborn with the villains, and was in the immediate proximity ofAsgardwhen it fell. His last sight was Diamondback running towards Captain America, who had arrived with the Avengers. He assumed that, because Diamondback and the Captain had dated previously, she was going back to him and did not really love a \"loser like him.\" He then left with the Taskmaster to renew a life of crime.[19]\nConstrictor attendedArcade's birthday party, but found him insufferable. His complaints were overheard by Arcade, so he had him ejected from his party. Not long afterwards, Arcade opened a bar calledthe HoleinBagalia, which Constrictor tried to rob. However, he was tricked into pressing a button that launched a giant hammer at him, knocking him out.[20][21]\nHe was later hired by thePhiladelphiancrime-lordLord Ogreto fightVenom. Constrictor worked withLord DeathstrikeandJack O'Lantern, all as employees to Lord Ogre. Venom was able to escape in the midst of the fight.[22]\nConstrictor was with the Masters of Evil when BaronHelmut Zemobecame the new leader following the death ofMax Fury.

Cable'sCelestialA.I.,Professor, had assumed control of Graymalkin. The station had complete control over every part of its structure and could fashion rooms, weapons, and vehicles as needed from various storehouses and parts it had. It was able to design and run training programs for Cable, as well as make living quarters and workshop areas for him. Graymalkin not only served as a base for Cable, but also allowed Cable to teleport through time and space, with the time displacement core (TDC). Cable simply had to command Professor to \"Body-Slide\" him to a destination.[2]\nGraymalkin faked its destruction whenNick Fury, agents ofS.H.I.E.L.D., andWar Machinetried to investigate it for whereabouts on Cable, dumping parts in the ocean and inX-Force'sCamp Verdebase, but the remaining parts, including its core, used cloaking to hide itself.[3]\nMagneto also stationed Asteroid M in Earth's orbit, as a headquarters. Asteroid M had been destroyed and reconstructed many times, so it's uncertain which model, if not pieces of them all, Magneto used to build Avalon. All of them had several levels, including an observation deck, hangar bays, medical facilities, and technology that kept it concealed from standard detection technology.[4][5]\nMagneto discovered Graymalkin, deactivated the Professor, and used theShi'artechnology stolen from his time with theX-Mento expand it with pieces from his older space station, Asteroid M, naming it Avalon. From Avalon, Magneto sent out his new servant,Exodus, to bring mutants to it. Exodus first went to ex members of Magneto's original group, theBrotherhood of Evil Mutants, but did not find them worthy. Next, Magneto chose his former students, now members of X-Force, who had been students of Magneto when they were part of theNew Mutants. X-force leader, Cable, followed and managed to disable Avalon's teleportation system and copied the Professor from the core of the station into his own techno-organic body parts. Cable and his team escaped, but former New MutantsRusty CollinsandSkidsremained on Avalon with Magneto, due to the fact that he reversed the brainwashing thatStryfehad implanted.[1]\nShortly afterward, Magneto sent Exodus to bring his followers, theAcolytes, a cult devoted to and his views on human-mutant relations, to Avalon as well and after expellingFabian Cortez, collected the group. Magneto declared that Avalon would be a safe haven for all mutants, away from humanity and all mutants that declined his offer were considered enemies. He took Avalon into Earth's atmosphere and during its approach, its shadow sent several million into abnormal darkness.

She swiftly pierced him in the back with three knives. Cable warmly greeted \"Domino,\" recognizing his old ally. Updating her on theNew Mutants' team status, Cable disclosed that several pivotal members had departed, yet he remained undeterred, harboring plans for incoming recruits.

The warrior,Shatterstar, reveals a mission from the future before they're attacked by Imperial Protectorates, swiftly defeated. Meanwhile, Feral seeks refuge from pursuers in the team's midst, ultimately gaining their trust. Cable proposes relocation for safety, enlisting the help of Shatterstar, Warpath (formerly Proudstar), andFeral, forming a new team calledX-Force.[9]\n\"Domino\" and Cable's new X-Force team planned to confront theAlliance of Eviland uncover their motives. The IDIC Corporation, behind the Alliance's actions, pursues a mysterious energy absorption project with implications forA.I.M.andGenetech. X-Force clashed with the Alliance atNiagara Falls, defeating them, butPiecemealandHarnessescapes after absorbing more energy.

Despite setbacks, the heroes persevere, with Warpath's quick thinking allowing them to regroup and continue the fight.[15]\nDeadpool breaks into the X-Force HQ, and takes out Shatterstar and Siryn. Deadpool launched into a brutal assault on \"Domino\", repeatedly referring to her as Vanessa. He reveals that she has been working as a mole for Tolliver and has been giving him trade secrets on the team but has stopped recently. They continued to fight and Deadpool threatened that she must start giving Tolliver what he wants or Tolliver will come after her and escaped.[16]Cable was willing to forgive her for her betrayal still thinking she is Domino, but the rest of the team is still not trusting. Cable finally comes up with a plan and it is to use Domino in a plot to get to Tolliver. Domino sits in front of a screen and talks to Tolliver. She explained that she has rigged the base to explode during a training session by X-Force and that they should all be killed in the explosion. Cable watched and plans to detonate the bomb to make Tolliver believe they are killed so that they can take the battle to him.[17]Cable orchestrated the destruction of the base to deceive Tolliver, making him believe X-Force is obliterated. With Tolliver unsuspecting, Cable and Domino launch a surprise attack on him.[18]However, Cable is shocked to find the real Domino held captive, unaware that the one he had been working with was Copycat.[19]As she later explained to the real Domino, the other members were unable to detect a difference because she was able to exactly duplicate Domino's appearance, personality, fingerprints, even DNA. Tolliver ultimately ordered Copycat to bomb X-Force's headquarters, but she had come to care for her teammates, and she stalled until Tolliver dispatched the masked mercenary Deadpool to force her hand. Confronted by X-Force over her betrayal, but still posing as Domino, Copycat helped them fight Tolliver. While Cable discovered the true Domino still alive as Tolliver's prisoner, Copycat was felled by Deadpool, though she managed to escape.[20]\nCopycat, fearing repercussions from Tolliver and Deadpool, went into hiding at to place of her close friend,Tina Valentino.[21]After laying low for weeks, she decided to venture out one night masquerading as Tina's twin sister.[1]They head to a bar in Boston that resembled the famous Cheers.

Tragically, Tina was fatally shot by her ex-boyfriendSluggoduring the chaos. Copycat fled while Sluggo informed Deadpool about Tolliver's will.[23]Back at Tina's residence, Copycat hastily tried to pack and leave town before Deadpool caught up with her. However, she was intercepted just in time by Domino,Hammer, andGrizzly. They swiftly neutralized Deadpool and Sluggo.[24]They questioned Copycat about where X-Force was located. Domino continued to be upset that Copycat was helping them at all since she destroyed Domino's life for more than a year while Tolliver held her prisoner and Vanessa posed as her. She grabbed a gun and shot Sluggo and Deadpool in the back again and then they all head off to find X-Force.[25]\nCopycat, Grizzly, Hammer, and Domino, search for Cable and X-Force at their old Adirondack base, finding it buried under rocks. Despite no one inside, Copycat suggests using the base's equipment to track them. Hammer and his crew head to Camp Verde, Arizona, leaving Hammer in the Winnebago while the others search for X-Force. They encounter Cable,Kane, andBridgeinstead. Copycat, posing as Domino, embraced Cable, who pushed her away in confusion. As they regroup, Hammer's Winnebago trapped Cable, shocking him until Kane intervened, revealing Cable's efforts to help Hammer walk again. Hammer refused the aid, valuing his humanity over becoming like Cable. The team decided to split up, with Copycat running off and Kane pursuing her, while Cable waited for X-Force. The former Six Pack members depart in the Winnebago.[26]\nCopycat then became involved in the hunt for Tolliver's will, during which she was wounded bySlayback. Her injuries would have proved fatal, but she survived by copying Deadpool's healing factor.[27]Later, Copycat sought to live a peaceful life inSan Francisco,CaliforniawithGarrison Kane, but she soon encountered Deadpool again, an encounter which would have proven fatal hadWolverinenot interfered in a timely manner.[4]She was subsequently captured and taken to theMicroverseby the emotion-manipulatingPsycho-Man, who sought Kane's advanced technology. She was rescued by Kane, Cable, Domino, and the Microverse's resident heroes, theMicrons. Returning to Earth, Copycat finally made peace with Domino.[28]\nIntent on exacting revenge on Deadpool,Taskmasterand theWizarddevised a cunning plan. They enlisted the aid of Copycat to masquerade as the formidableTitania. Her mission: to infiltrate Deadpool's inner circle and earn his trust. However, Deadpool proved to be more astute than they anticipated, eventually seeing through Copycat's clever ruse. The failed deception only served to escalate the tension between Deadpool and his adversaries.[29][30]\nCopycat went on to join the subversiveWeapon X Projectalongside Kane. She was forced to attend daily briefings along with the rest of the X recruits.[31]She was sent to recruit Deadpool into the program. However, her power enhancement by Weapon X began to affect her memory, and she lost track of her mission. Instead, she began seducing Deadpool, but ultimately ended their relationship over his infatuation withSiryn. She would often take the form of other women to surprise him.[32]Deadpool was subsequently recruited by the Weapon X Project to eliminate Copycat, but he refused and tried to warn her. Weapon X then sent Kane to kill both Copycat and Deadpool. Deadpool fought Kane on his own, but Copycat was mortally wounded at the Bronx Zoo in New York City by another Weapon X agent,Sabretooth. She almost died in Deadpool's arms, but a drop of his blood, which had his regenerative healing factor, mixed with hers, seemingly saving her life.[33][34]"

When doing so, the muscle tissue of her limbs gorge with blood and swell to many times their normal size, thereby giving them the appearance of large snakes. Her limbs are capable of generating up to 125 pounds of pressure per square inch, which is enough force to deform a steel tube two feet in diameter and one inch thick.[49]\nAmphibian Physiology:Anaconda possesses gills gained through surgical placement that allow her to extract oxygen from the water to breathe. She is able to survive andbreathewhile underwater indefinitely, as well as on land.[49]\nSuperhuman Strength:The bioengineering process has augmented Anaconda's musculature to superhuman levels. At her peak, she possesses sufficient superhuman strength to lift approximately 2 tons. However, while using her strength to constrict rather than lift, she possesses a grip that can only be broken by someone whose strength exceeds her own by at least a factor of 30 (60 ton strength minimum).[49]\nSuperhuman Swimming Speed:Anaconda is capable of propelling herself through the water at speeds beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human swimmer. At her peak, she can propel herself at speeds of about 30 miles per hour.[50]\nSuperhuman Stamina:Anaconda's superior musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of any ordinary human. At her peak, she can exert herself for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in her blood begins to impair her.[50]\nSuperhuman Durability:Roxxon's bioengineering process has fortified the cellular structure of Anaconda's bodily tissue, making it more resistant to physical injury than the body of a normal human. She can withstand great impact forces, such as falls from great heights or being struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury herself.[50]\nSuperhuman Agility:Anaconda's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.[50]"

The capital city and seat of government wasBarjñov.

In Rumekistan, the Flag-Smasher was confronted by theV-BattalionandCitizen V, who convinced the Flag-Smasher that he should not force his ideas on others but should achieve them through generations of a concerted social agenda. He agreed to cease all hostilities, and the V-Battalion used their technology to cause Rumekistan's army to fall asleep, allowing the Flag-Smasher to quickly and bloodlessly take control of the country. The Flag-Smasher set himself as ruler, hoping this would be the first step towards his dream of global harmony.[2]\nCablecame to the country soon afterDominoassassinated Flag-Smasher. Cable, who had been the secret leader of the Rumekistan Resistance, was proclaimed President Pro Tem of the entire country.[3]This was, in part, an event manipulated by Citizen V, who was masquerading as the slightly more public face of the Resistance.[4]\nAlthough things started to turn for the better, the country was targeted by organized attacks, sponsored by the U.S. Government, to destroy Cable's credibility. TheSix Packattempted to disrupt Barjnov's power grid, and in the process Cable was shot byDeadpool,[5]who had joined the Six Pack in secret after losing faith in Cable's messianic vision.

W. Bridge was member of the mercenary group called the Wild Pack, later known as theSix Pack, which was led byCable. The Six Pack was decimated in an assault on one of Stryfe's hidden bases.[4]\nBridge became a major ofS.H.I.E.L.D.[5]In the early stages ofX-Force, Bridge tracked Cable and tried to capture him. S.H.I.E.L.D. formed an alliance withDepartment Kand convinced them to have their still in training task force calledWeapon P.R.I.M.E.help bring Cable down off the books.[6]Along with former Six Pack membersKaneandGrizzly, plus other recruits, Bridge attacked X-Force in an attempt to arrest Cable. Weapon P.R.I.M.E. failed, and X-Force made off in Bridge's own air transport.[7]\nAfter Cable was presumed dead, Bridge andNick Furyled a squad into space to lay claim toGraymalkin, but they were repelled by X-Force.[8]Quitting S.H.I.E.L.D. after this and the Weapon P.R.I.M.E. fiasco, Bridge went looking for Cable on his own. They met up as Cable returned from his future timeline to his Swiss chalet, and mostly buried the hatchet. G.W. joined up with the former Six Pack members as they parted ways with Cable.[9]\nDuring Cable's conflict with theDark Sisterhood, Bridge was on a mission to capture Cable, who was suspected of killing S.H.I.E.L.D's agents.[10]\nDuring theCivil War, or shortly after, Bridge briefly became the leader of the Six Pack again and was hired by the US government to attackRumekistan, a country which Cable had temporarily seized power in, with the approval of the people, and was trying to make a utopia before scheduled free elections began. Cable's attention was diverted by a nuclear explosion onProvidenceso that Bridge and the Six Pack could make their way covertly into the country as insurgents. They placed devices which would cause chaos with the power grid to destabilize the country and work towards tarnishing Cable's reputation while S.H.I.E.L.D. lied to the media about radioactive fallout caused by the 'accident' on Providence. Bridge and the Six Pack were unaware that Cable knew of their plans and allowed them to happen so he could defeat and expose them, so as to cement his stature with the people. Bridge and the team were then captured and publicly shamed for their actions.[11]\nAfter the Civil War, Bridge tried to capture and stop thePunisherand failed while working with S.H.I.E.L.D. team.[12]He began working alone and atTimes Square, he tried to trick the Punisher by releasing and payingBushwackerto act as bait. The operation was a failure as everyone forgot the situation, watching coverage of theCaptain Americaassassination on the giant Time Square screen after Bushwacker was taken down and Bridge was deputized while dealing with the situation.[13]A second operation was conducted by Bridge andSitwell, failing too.[14]\nAfter this,Tony Stark, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., dismissed him from his functions due to his failures and the actions he had taken, this didn't stop Bridge as he quickly returned to tracking the Punisher as a freelance operative covertly offering bounty hunters a million dollars for information leading him to the Punisher.[15]\nContacted byStuart Clarke, he helped them take down the racist white nationalistNational Forcegroup who were led by a newHate-Monger, and let Clarke and Castle free to leave when they surrendered. He was quickly contacted by Stark but took pleasure in refusing his proposition. When Stark came to see him to try and convince him to start working with S.H.I.E.L.D. again he admitted to letting the Punisher go, and to his internal struggles regarding his hate for the Punisher and ultimately agreed to come back into the fold, as long as he had his 'crew' working alongside him.[16]\nG.W. Bridge began putting together an all female team to take on Frank, consisting ofDomino,Silver Sable, andContessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. Frank was plagued by the return ofJigsawwho, alongsideLynn Michaels, had brainwashed a former auxiliary volunteer officer namedIanto act as the Punisher to aid him in gun running and other criminal enterprises while framing Frank and sendingHandassassins to kill him. Bridge didn't believe Frank to be guilty of these crimes, and brought his team to New York to discover the truth but also to still try and take him down.[17]\nBridge ended up saving Frank from Ian just in time, before he was going to be killed and arrested him. Bridge was finally able to truly sit down and talk with Frank while transferring him to theRaft, using the conversation largely to insult him and tell him that he believed Frank had kept Jigsaw alive to make himself feel better in comparison to him. Before they could reach the Raft though they were attacked by theWrecking Crewon theBrooklyn Bridge, who had been hired to finish the job that the Hand had failed at, with Bridge getting him badly in the knee by theWrecker's Crowbar. Frank had a chance to kill Jigsaw and escape with the mystically empowered Crowbar but chose to let Bridge arrest him and send him to the Raft instead.[18]\nWhen theSkrullSecret Invasionof Earth began, Bridge was working with S.H.I.E.L.D. to combat the invasion. Bridge was informed byJasper Sitwellthat the Punisher had broken out of the Grey Facility in which he had been imprisoned and headed into the heart of New York City, where his attack on a group of Skrulls had threatened the lives of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Bridge was sent after the Punisher and found him shortly before Frank was attacked by aSuper-Skrullmodeled after theKingpinandHammerhead. The two were initially saved from this Skrull byStuart Clarke, who had donned the Rampage exo-suit to kill Frank in vengeance for the murder ofTatiana Arocha.[19]\nThe fight with the Super-Skrull commenced again shortly after while Clarke was attempting to kill Frank, causing Bridge to have to fight and kill the Skrull alone. After killing this Skrull, Bridge was then targeted by another Skrull, who was using a far reaching sniper rifle to target him. Bridge was saved from the sniper by Frank who he then revealed the truth about Clarke to, that Clarke was a cop killer with an obsessive vendetta againstTony Stark, which led Frank to leave Bridge alone to target Clarke who had gone to take out the sniper. The building in which Frank and Clarke fought was destroyed by a group of Skrulls, who Bridge took out, before finding an injured Clarke in the rubble and informing him that Frank had taken the opportunity to disappear. Bridge then visited Clarke in the hospital where he had received grafts to fix his face, which was now scarred in a similar way toJigsaw.[20]\nWith the fall of the S.H.I.E.L.D, Bridge no longer had money to feed his new wife and her child. Abducted by some of the criminals resurrected in order to kill Castle, he was finally killed by the resurrectedMicrochipas a sacrifice for the resurrection of Frank Castle and Microchip's families.[1]"

However, he found himself at a loss regarding what to do with his life after graduation.[5]He eventually decided to enlist in theArmy.\nWhile enlisted, it soon became apparent that Bourne possessed a natural aptitude for hand to hand combat. He met an officer namedMelindawhile stationed inWest Germanyand the two quickly fell in love. However, their happiness ended when Melinda was murdered in a terrorist attack. Her death proved an immense blow to Bourne, and a few months after the funeral he was drafted to a top-secret special forces unit calledOmega Strike.[5]\nOmega Strike was an elite special forces unit that had been created to combat terrorism. Out of the two hundred candidates that joined the program, only twelve soldiers were able to make it through the grueling ten month training program. James not only endured, but excelled in the program, earning a spot on the Omega Strike team next to leaderEmil Tessler. After making it on the team, tiny cybernetic chips were implanted in all of the team member's brains and linked to their adrenal glands, giving them the ability to teleport at will. However, many individuals didn't survive the operation, due to their brains rejecting the implant.[5]By this time, Bourne had grown very close to one of his squad members namedRowena Maclean.\nThe Omega Strike team was soon sent to their first mission toItalywhere some terrorists had hijacked a plane. James was given the lead of hostage recovery unit and Rowena andGabriel Gantleaded the terrorist termination unit. Upon the jump from the plane, each of James’ team were killed in a matter of seconds. He was also wounded himself, but managed to teleport to the passenger section of the plane. When he arrived he saw that Grant had killed all of the terrorists, hostages, and even his teammates except Rowena. James wanted an explanation and Grant told him that he and Tessler had been paid to make the mission a failure. James was also told that they are going to start their own terrorist organization when they collected enough money, and then shot James hitting him in the stomach. Rowena tried to stop Grant, but as too late. Rowena said to James that she didn’t have a choice and that she will always love him. She also hanged a golden necklace on his neck before she and Grant teleported away. Soon after they left, James himself teleported away and got his injuries treated. Shortly after healing his injuries, he tried to find Rowena. He discovered that she and Grant had died in a plane crash and that Grant left false evidence incriminating Bourne. At that moment, James Bourne died and Solo was born.[5]\nBourne traveled the globe hunting down and destroying as many terrorist group he could find. This lead to him meetingSpider-Manwhose moral code was against killing, the exact opposite of Solo's outlook on defeating his enemies.[6]\nSolo killed a squad ofU.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. agentsin the sewers underParis, while looking forMajor Weil.Captain Americaasked Spider-Man to join him andSilver Sablein a raid of ULTIMATUM's hideout, but they were interrupted by Solo who arrived to kill Weil. Cap stopped Solo, explaining they needed Weil alive, but Weil escaped in the confusion. Sable interrogated a captured ULTIMATUM agent and learned thatSabretoothkilledLimka. She was informed that tensions betweenSymkariaand theUSAwere rising and the American ambassador has been recalled. The next step could be war.[7]\nSolo fought a group of Spanish terrorists.[8]\nHe then later took on theTarantulain theRepublic of Delvadia.[9]\nSoon after theSinister Sixreform and defeat both Spider-Man and theHulk, Solo aided the web-slinger in his second fight against the super villain team.[10]Things took a turn for the worse whenMysterioused an illusion to make Solo believe he was attacking the Six, when in reality he was attacking Spider-Man, allowing the Six to escape. Solo escaped and Spider-Man was rescued byCyborg XandDeathlok.[11]Soon after, Solo rejoined Spider-Man to aid him in a final assault on the Six aided by the Hulk,Ghost Rider,Sleepwalker,Nova, Deathlok and theFantastic Four. With the villains defeated, Solo disappeared.[12]\nHe temporarily resurfaced and killedGiancarlo GelbertoinRome.[13]\nSolo helped Spider-Man once again when they fought againstTaskmaster,Blood Spider,Death-ShieldandJagged Bow.[14]They managed to defeat all the others, but Taskmaster managed to escape. Before Solo teleported away he told Spider-Man that theRed Skullplanned to disturb America Day celebration inNew York.[15]\nShortly after his last encounter with Spider-Man, Solo had a run in withNick Furywhile he was stoppingViperfrom stealing nuclear missiles. Fury didn't really appreciate Solo's help and blamed him of Viper's escape. Solo didn't like Fury's attitude and teleported away leaving him alone in the factory.[16]\nWhile tracking terrorists, Solo encountered a ghost from his past in the form of Gabriel Grant, who now called himself Deathstorm and Grant had staged his own death.Black Cathas been hired to infiltrate a stronghold and steal back a stolen painting. During the robbery he teleported in and killed every guard. Solo told Black Cat that she should go but she continued after the painting. Solo and Deathstorm fight it out in another part of the compound. Solo gained the upper hand and begins to fire at Deathstorm's head, but Deathstorm teleported away. Black Cat came back and finds solo alone. She asked what happened and Solo yells at her to just leave.[17]\nGrant now ran his own terrorist organization calledA.R.E.S.The two fought, but Deathstorm eventually escaped. Solo tracked him toManhattan, where he found Rowena stealing Omega Strike files.[5]Rowena teleported away before he had time to react. Solo turned around and saw a bomb on the table and quickly teleported away. Back at his hideout, Solo went over copies of the old Omega Strike files on his computer. The memories overwhelmed him as he burst into tears. Holding the necklace Rowena gave him tightly in his fist, he vowed to save Rowena by any means necessary.[18]\nSolo saw the news coverage of Spider-Man fighting A.R.E.S. agents and he quickly teleported himself directly in the middle of the fight. The two quickly won the fight, but Deathstorm still managed to escape. Later, Solo and Spider-Man teamed up multiple times to take on A.R.E.S. After one of these encounters, Spider-Man decided that he wouldn’t let Solo escape. He eventually defeated Solo and turned him in. However, when he was being transported, Solo managed to escape by subduing the two guards. He tracked A.R.E.S. down and managed to stop Tessler from killing several people. When he was about to shoot Tessler, Rowena jumped in the line of fire. Solo asked why she stopped him and Rowena explained that Tessler was her father. Tessler used the confusion to teleport away. When Solo noticed, he followed with Rowena right behind him.[19]\nWhen they re-materialized again they saw that Deathstroke had broken Tessler's neck. Solo attacked, but the ship eventually crashed into the ocean doing major battle damage. Deathstorm pulled himself out of the water just in time to see Solo aiming a gun at him, holding an unconscious Rowena in his other arm. He fired his gun, hitting and killing Deathstorm right before he had a chance to teleport away. Unfortunately, the bullet went all the way through and hit a civilian woman and accidentally killed her. Spider-Man saw this happen and accused Solo, once again, of being just as bad as the terrorists he hunted. Solo then quietly waited for the police to arrive, then allowed them to arrest him, feeling tremendous guilt for the death of an innocent person.[20]\nSolo went after a rampaging \"Wolverine\" when his mind was seemingly being influenced by an alien. Solo worked withCardiacbut they were both no match against him.Nightcrawlerarrived to stop the fight and explained what happened. Solo believed him and left severely injured from the fight.[21]\nSix Pack\nSolo was hired byG. W.

Russo killed all of his targets but Castle, who narrowly avoided death in an explosion. Hours later, Castle, now turned into the Punisher, tracked down Russo to one of the Costas' nightclubs:Salvagno's. Several criminals were killed, and Russo was thrown through a glass pane head-first.[5]Somehow, he survived with his face torn to shreds; surgeons stitched it back together like a jigsaw puzzle.[9]\nBilly as Jigsaw\nTaking advantage of his now hideous visage, the formerly handsome gangster took on the identity of Jigsaw and initially attempted to frame the Punisher for murder. However, the plan failed due to the intervention ofSpider-ManandNightcrawler; Spider-Man witnessed one of Jigsaw's murders and one of his victims was an old friend of Nightcrawler.[10]\nBilly had been lying low due to Spider-Man, which began to annoy his men. Under their pressure, he agreed to plan a heist. They attacked a boat and demanded that everyone turn over their possessions. Unlucky for them Peter Parker was on the boat and had time to slip away to become Spider-Man and defeated the crooks, but Jigsaw managed to takeLiz AllenandHarry Osbornhostage. Not wishing his friends to be killed by Jigsaw, Spider-Man let them leave, but not before he could tag Harry with aSpider-Tracer. Spider-Man went on the hunt for Jigsaw, putting the crook into a state of fear during his pursuit. When Jigsaw finally got a bead on Spider-Man with his gun, Spider-Man called his bluff and the criminal found that he could not bring himself to shoot Spider-Man, and he was easily tied up for the police.[11]\nBilly was behind a plan to drug the Punisher, causing his enemy to behave erratically and attack any criminals, even for things as minor as littering.[12]The Punisher confronted and beat him, and later stopped Jigsaw from escaping in a prison riot. Later on, Jigsaw was brainwashed by theTrustinto serving as a new member of a Punisher-style assassination squad. He managed to remember who he was after encountering Castle once again, and he attacked the Punisher, but was once again beaten.[13]\nBilly became involved with a demon worshiper he referred to as 'theRev'. Based on small healing demonstrations, the Rev convinced Jigsaw to work for him in exchange for healing his face. Jigsaw followed the man on a home invasion/murder spree and then killed several cops on the way out. This incident warmed him to the concept of worshipingLucifer.[14]\nBilly was a persistent foe of the Punisher's for years. While he still worked as an assassin for criminal organizations, his pursuit of the Punisher was relentless, as Jigsaw saw Castle's assassination as an unfinished job. The deranged gangster's vendetta once took a bizarre turn when the Punisher faked his death by appearing to be executed in prison. Furious with rage, Jigsaw briefly became a new Punisher, getting revenge on Castle's apparent killers for denying him the kill he believed to be rightfully his.[15]\nDaredevil and the Black Widow took down Jigsaw. Mistaking him for the wrong kind of Kingpin, Jigsaw makes bail and comes to ask Matt if he can have permission to run crime inHell's Kitchen.[16]Jigsaw and his men came to Matt again and he cannot become Daredevil in time.[17]Rather than prove completely that he is DD, Matt has to let the police and the Widow break up a home invasion of the Murdock residence by Jigsaw.[18]\nHe was imprisoned on the maximum security prison known as theRaft, a floating prison for supervillains and other high-risk criminals. He was one of the many inmates trying to break out, Jigsaw was among those who were stopped by theNew Avengers.[19][20]\nBilly was hired by theHoodto take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by theSuperhuman Registration Act.[21]Now part of theHood's Gang,[7]he battled theSkrullsduring theirSecret Invasionof Earth.[22]He was with the team when they took on theNew AvengersandDark Avengers.[23]He was with the gang when they were attacked by the Punisher.[24]\nDuring this time he also renewed his own criminal career with the Hood's blessing. He was still unbalanced and obsessed with Frank and hadLynn Michaelsbrainwash a man namedIanto act as thePunisherso as to frame Frank, and hired theHandto try and kill him before hiring theWrecking Crewin order to kill him when the Hand and Ian failed and Frank was transferred to theRaftbyG.W. Bridge. They were promised $50 million if successful. However they were all defeated by the Punisher as he received help from theRhinowho was sent byStuart Clarke. The Punisher usedWrecker's Crowbarin order to finish offThunderballand then also used it on Russo, who repeatedly told Frank that he loved him but also wanted to kill him, as well as asking Frank to kill him before his arrest. Lynn, who had actually been an undercover agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. later allowed Ian to shoot Russo in his cell, feeling guilty for what she had done to him to maintain her cover.[25]\nWhen Stuart Clarke tried to kill Russo'sson, Punisher acted. After an explosion, Henry let Jigsaw fall to the flames of a burning building.[26]Jigsaw resurfaced months after his apparent death.[27]\nJigsaw attended a meeting of various villains organized by theWizardto discuss what to do aboutDoctor Doomwho had unexpectedly decided to become a superhero and become the newIron Man. As theHoodbrought up the idea of forming a gang of villains to take Doom out, Doom suddenly appeared and took down all of the villains present.[28]He later participated in an ambush against Doom along with many of the other villains that Doom had earlier defeated.[29]He also attended a meeting to discuss the Hood's rise as the Kingpin of crime.[30]\nAfter impersonating the Punisher and ruining his reputation,[31]Hydra's leaderBaron ZemoandMayor Fiskcame up with a plan to deal with Castle once and for all. Along with other villains, Jigsaw joined a new incarnation of theThunderboltsin the role of the mercenaryPaladin. He was introduced at a press conference with the other members as Citizen V pronounced that they will end the Punisher's reign of terror and restore order toNew York City.[3]\nMoon Knight was later sent byRampageto beat Billy, who had returned to the Jigsaw alias. Jigsaw was surprised to learn that Rampage was still alive, and even more so to learn that Moon Knight was working for him. The two fought, with Moon Knight seemingly winning.[2]"

He is severely injured in the crash and had no defense when Predator X comes along and gobbles him up.

They exit their vehicle, and just as they are about to help her, her readings switch back to mutant. She says, \"What can I say? It comes and it goes.\" Jamie and his dupes attack and subdue the guards. Jamie pumps one of the guards for information, though his temper gets the best of him.\nBack at the hospital in Cooperstown, Alaska, X-Force sneaks past the police officers to enter the building.

The team splits up to in an attempt to find a trackable scent, hopefully Cable's. Wolverine tells Warpath to work with Wolfsbane, and he says he'd rather work with Hepzibah. Wolverine reiterates his command, telling Warpath to follow orders. As Warpath is walking away, Wolverine tells Rahne to watch Warpath, fearing he my flake out or hesitate when it comes time to complete the mission. Talking with Rahne, warpath says he's not comfortable going against Cable, but sees how the child is more important.\nBack in Canada, Cable is holding his own against Lady Deathstrike and the assassins.\nIn the future, a calmer Jamie gets information from the guard. It is revealed that all communications, even conversations, are monitored by the Government for mention of mutants. The guard also says that mutants brought the camps on themselves.\nSiryn finds Peepers' remains and is horrified.\nAt the Hospital, Caliban has discovered Cable's trail, but also alerted the police to their presence. Subduing the officers at the scene, X-Force makes their escape through some old maintenance tunnels Warpath discovered. Rahne reassures Wolverine that Warpath will get the job done.\nAt the ruined mansion, Xavier sadly looks at a smashed picture of Cable and the old X-Force in happier times.\nIn Canada, Deathstrike and the assassins are getting the best of Cable and have him cornered.\nJamie is incredulous that mutants could be responsible for the concentration camps. Before he can learn more, however, Jamie and Layla are surrounded by cops. The guard says the Jamie alerted the cops the second he mention mutants. The cops take Jamie into custody, but Layla scans as normal. One of the guards tries to warn the cops that she's a mutant, but a dupe knocks him out. The cops activate a power dampener and Jamie's dupes disappear. The cops ask Layla if she was Jamie's hostage and she says no, that she is his accomplice and that it's part of her power to appear normal. Jamie and Layla are handcuffed and taken away."

Logan is surprised to find his friend back doing his old job before joining Alpha Flight, but learns that he is only covering for his friend Bambi Bolinsky, who has suffered a broken arm. Bambi explains she broke it kicking eight men out of the bar the night before and invites them to sit down and play a game called split the fly: it involves using spit to attract a fly and sugar and attempt to stab it with a knife. When Bambi succeeds at it, she hands her knife over to Logan to give him a try. Logan gives it a shot just as the man Puck just threw out of the bar returns with some of his friends. Watching as Wolverine stabs a knife through his hand without reacting, the tough guys realize they're dealing with more than they had bargained for, and they wisely flee the scene.\nMeanwhile in Osaka, Japan, some police arrive at the crime scene where Wolverine had battled the Yakuza, and spot Lady Deathstrike snooping around the premises. She has come seeking evidence of the rumors Wolverine is still alive[1]. When the officers approach her she uses her claws to murder them in cold blood. Hacking into the Japanese police department’s computer database through the squad car, Lady Deathstrike finds a clue to the location of Wolverine: Madripoor. Reporting to Donald Pierce, she has Gateway teleport her back to Australia to tell him where she's tracked Logan to. Pierce points out that Madripoor is a dangerous place, even for the Reavers. However Lady Deathstrike still wishes to seek her revenge against Wolverine and convinces him to let Gateway teleport her there.\nAppearing in an Uppertown casino, Lady Deathstrike takes a bartender hostage and threatens to kill her unless Tyger Tiger tells her where Wolverine is hiding. Tiger relents and tosses her a postcard that Logan had sent her from Vancouver, so Deathstrike has Gateway teleport her off to Canada.\nIn Vancouver, Logan and Judd have gone out to do some drinking and fishing. While discussing their favorite writers, Judd drops an old photograph of Eugene back during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930's with Ernest Hemingway and him, as well as a girl named Inez. Judd is surprised when Logan knows her name even though he was never there. While they are discussing this, in Australia, Lady Deathstrike is instructing Gateway to teleport her to the exact location that Logan is gazing at, hoping to avoid wasting time searching all over Vancouver for him. This has unpredictable results as while Gateway teleports her to Logan's location, she, Logan and Puck all find themselves caught in a time vortex and are teleported back in time to Spain circa 1937.\nWolverine and Puck find themselves in the middle of a bullfight with Hemingway and Inez watching, and much to Eugene's surprise his original height has been restored. When the bullfighter is killed by the bull, Eugene grabs the cap and begins taming the bull while Logan joins Hemingway and Inez in the stands. When she asks how the two men suddenly appeared in the ring, he tells them it was magic. When a plane suddenly dive bombs the arena, Logan, Puck, Inez and Hemingway see that a full-out air raid is happening. Wolverine and Puck soon realize that they are in Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. When a plane attempts to gun them down, Logan grabs the bullfighting rapier that Eugene was using to tame the bull and throws it, impaling the pilot and causing him to crash into a nearby building. When Hemingway pulls up in his car, Logan and Puck hop aboard and Hemingway asks them if they are joining Inez's resistance movement. As they drive off, Puck is ecstatic to be reliving one of his glory days, but Wolverine warns him not to get too excited because if Lady Deathstrike is here in the past with them as well, they could be in a heap of trouble.\nSure enough, Lady Deathstrike is in this time as well. Having killed a soldier and stole his binoculars, she watches as Logan and Puck speed away from the war zone and realizes that she is not in Canada anymore. She is then surrounded by an army of soldiers lead by the Nazi Captain Horst Schlachtner of the Legion Kondor. Seeing that she has killed one of his troops, he assumes that she is a Republican partisan and tells her that she is to be hanged with fencing wire.\nThis story is continued next issue..."

As he and Storm rush toward the burning building, Elsie-Dee makes the fire worse in order to keep Storm away and so that she can complete her prime directive. As Wolverine bursts through the fire, Elsie-Dee's partner, the Wolverine construct known as Albert makes good his escape as his repair systems initiate. With his intelligence boosted he hopes that Elsie-Dee doesn't get destroyed, however upon contacting her via their radio link he learns too late that Wolverine walked through the blazing inferno to save her. Seeing how selfless Wolverine is makes Elsie-Dee realize that Logan is a good man and she becomes sorry that she is programmed to destroy him.\nIn Australia, the Reavers are out relaxing waiting to learn the fate of Wolverine. Bonebreaker confides in Reese and tells him that he accidentally programmed Elsie-Dee with a genius level intellect instead of that of a five-year-old girl like Pierce had ordered. He is about to tell Pierce this out of guilt, but when he overhears Lady Deathstrike and Pierce gloating over their plan, has second thoughts and decides to keep it to himself.\nBack in California, the mobsters led by Sally find themselves in the water alongside Albert. When they call him \"friend\", Albert instantly asks them if they are truly his friends. Seeing this as an opportunity to exploit Albert's abilities, they agree to this notion and agree to find a way to repair him. Albert goes along easily enough, knowing that Elsie-Dee is going to explode soon. Over in the warehouse, Wolverine has pulled Elsie-Dee out of the blaze. His healing factor heals all his burns and his incinerated hair grows back. Upset that she has found someone who actually cares about her and that she is going to blow them up, she confesses the whole situation to an astonished Wolverine and Storm. Showing them the digital readout screen on her back confirms this and Storm and Elsie-Dee both tell Wolverine to leave to save himself. However, moved by the little android’s humanity, Wolverine doesn't want to abandon her and promises to do everything he can to try and stop the bomb inside her from exploding.\nMeanwhile, Albert has the mobsters drive him to the nearest Radio Hut where he speed reads all the books in the place and links up to the computers and uses their modems to access the NSA's computer databases to access information to try and find a way to save Elsie-Dee. When the owner of the store protests this activity, the mobsters convince him to let Albert do his thing by putting a gun up to his face.\nBack on Venice Beach, Elsie-Dee struggles to try and find the code to disarm the bomb inside her but finds that her memory doesn't have the capacity. With a crowd growing, Storm orders Wolverine to get rid of the android or she will be forced to toss it into the ocean with her mutant powers in order to protect the crowd. Not willing to abandon Elsie-Dee, Wolverine tells her he will shield the girl android with his body if need be. The crowd soon becomes a moot point, when news of Albert's illegal breech of NSA computers sends the FBI and police to the Radio Hut where he is located, making the mob rush to check out the situation there. Meanwhile Albert has used the NSA super-computers to crack the code to the bomb that is inside Elsie-Dee. As Albert transmits it to her, he is gunned down by the assembled police and FBI agents that have arrived on the scene. Elsie-Dee manages to disarm the bomb at the last possible second. Wolverine and Storm rejoice with Elsie-Dee, however she becomes sad because when she tries to contact Albert, she gets no response. At the Radio Hut, the police and FBI surround the seemingly deactivated and bullet riddled body of Albert.\nThis story is continued next issue..."

He saw it many times, that story of an artificial being who ultimately found acceptance by the humans by becoming one of them. Today, it has powered a political awakening, which will see Hammond lead the people of the Core as they bring about the Singularity. No-one can stop them.\nOn a nightmarish parallel Earth, Hawkeye, Beast and Captain Britain have gone looking for a vital artifact, but run into the local version of the Avengers. Fighting them off, our heroes escape, and Captain Britain explains: the artifact is Merlin's Orb of Necromancy, stolen from Otherworld by Cap's father or the final stages of the Descendants' creation. It is the ultimate source of the \"spark\" of life that powers all Descendants today. Captain Britain thinks they can use it to kill all their opponents, but Hawkeye plans to use it only as a threat. Beast is skeptical of this tactic, but Hawkeye points out that if it was one of the many sapient AIs they have met, they would say the same as him. Beast protests they cannot even get home, but Cap says he has a plan.\nIn the Core, Venom, Valkyrie and Black Widow are breaking into Father's base, hoping to find something they can use. However, the only member of Father's army they encounter is a hidden Black Ant, who radios the others.\nIn New York, Father learns the call and gets down to his real mission: explaining his plan to the collected UN. He explains that he represents the next step in intelligent life on this planet, true cybernetic post-humanism. Humans have given the Descendants and their allies grief and racism in the past, but they are a community, with families and lives. More, the human civilization is so dependant on technology that they have already won. Father explains that Descendants live everywhere in human civilization, breeding with humans. He then introduces Parvez, a naturally-occuring Descendant, born of an android mother and a human father. His birth heralds the natural rise of the robots; Father is simply accelerating the process, using his nanotechnology to give all humans bodies like his.\nAt this, a man in the first row accuses him of being a super-villain, but Father dismisses this as the eternal complaint of the losers in a revolution. He calls upon his children to rise and spread the Descendant gospel.\nAt this, a man in the second row splits open, flooding the chamber with Father's nanotechnology. Around the world, humans, from unassuming New Yorkers to the Winter Guard of Russia, reveal themselves as Descendant sleepers. Around New York, heroes hear the news - and around New York, they encounter rebel robots, fighting for their future. Surveying this, Father says that his future has arrived.\n• Contagious Robotic Evolution is go and the remaining Secret Avengers are the only ones left! But how do you stop a plague that has already begun to spread?\n• Torch, Venom and Valkyrie infiltrate the rebel robot base In The Core, but are Lord UltraVision and Monarch Machine Man friend or foe?"

Freedom Force did this with Spider-Woman's help. The truth was revealed and Spider-Woman felt guilty and freed the Avengers and then left the team forcing her to become a fugitive.[5]\nLater, three other mutants were added to the roster:Super Sabre,Crimson Commando, andStonewall. They had been hunting down criminals and executing them for their past deeds to reduce the city's criminal element and for personal pleasure.

They later splintered off into their own criminal organization based out ofCooterman's CreekinAustralia.[1]\nThe first members of the Reavers were originally members of theHellfire Knights, the Hellfire Club's private military force. They originally came into being when themutantMastermindattempted to mentally controlJean Greyin a bid to join theHellfire Club's Inner Circle. In the resulting confrontation with theX-Men,Wolverinefell victim toLeland's mass-increasing powers, ending up in the New York sewer system and seemingly dying. Wolverine, very much alive, reentered the club through a secret sub-basement entrance. There, he attacked a group of mercenaries sent to track him down -Wade Cole,Angelo Macon, andMurray Reese- and critically injured them with his claws.[2]These men were eventually recovered and taken to theBody Shop, a shop run bySpiral, a servant ofMojo, that sold alien cybernetic parts to amputees and others who see the power of cybernetic limbs. The men andYuriko Oyamawere converted into cyborgs, becoming the first of the Reavers.[3]\nFirst appearance of the Reavers\nThe original Reavers, which includedBonebreaker,Pretty BoyandSkullbusterset up operations inCooterman's CreekinAustralia, and worked with a local aboriginal man namedGateway. He was a Mutant who could teleport people anywhere across the planet. They used him and their new found upgrades to rob a banks across the world.

In the confusion, Bonebreaker, Skullbuster and Pretty Boy managed to get away and ordered Gateway to teleport them away, telling the Aboriginal that if he does so then his debt to them is paid.[4]\nThe Reavers, officially led byDonald Pierceand working withLady Deathstrike, plotted revenge on the X-Men. They were unaware that they were being watched byNannyand theOrphan-Maker, who wanted the X-Men for themselves.[5]The Reavers practiced their coming attack on the X-Men by beating robot versions of the team. Nanny and the Orphan Maker, knowing of the coming deadly conflict with the Reavers kidnapped the X-Men.[6]They tried to track the X-Men unaware they had been transported to theSavage Land.[7]They captured Wolverine and hung him on a wooden X and tortured him. But later the town came under the fury of a powerful storm that seems to be encircling the whole globe. While the Reavers wait out the tempest inside, Jubilee freed Wolverine and the two escaped.[8]\nThe Reavers found the crucifix empty and searched the base for the escaped Logan. Jubilee and Wolverine attempted to flee the complex before being hunted by the Reavers' cyborg hounds.[9]They escaped from the Reavers base, but the cyborgs pinpointedMuir IslandinScotlandas their most probable destination and planned to invade the island.[10]The two X-Men held off the Reavers the best they could.[11]Freedom Forcearrived as back up to help stop the Reavers attack, but with disastrous consequences to the team:Avalanchewas wounded by Lady Deathstrike and Pierce killedStonewall. Meanwhile Destiny Wass murdered in cold blood by Legion, who also snuffed out Pyro's flame attack at a critical moment in the fight.Forgeturned the battle against the Reavers with a new sniper rifle that was capable of destroying Pierce's cyborgs.Skullbusterwas killed, but the others Reavers escaped.[12]\nIn anAthens,Greece, hospital, Donald Pierce made the horribly injuredCylla Markhaman offer she could not refuse.[13]In California, the Reavers destroyed a facility owned by Emma Frost, the Hellfire Club's White Queen. They intended to destroy as much property of Emma's as they have to, until they finally caught up with her.[14]\nWhenMicrochiptapped into the Reavers computer system, He stole plans to build a combat robot dubbed the \"Dalek\". The group found the hack and decided to seek revenge by trashing thePunisher's safe house and then went after Microchip and Castle.[15]Microchip created thePunisher's Exo-Armorto level the playing the field for Castle against the Reavers.[16]\nRoguewas spat out from theSiege Perilousto land in the former X-Men base in Australia only to learn it had become the HQ of the Reavers. Surprisingly,Carol Danvershad body of her own again and, while she fought the Reavers, Rogue absorbed Gateway's powers long enough to teleport herself and Carol away.[17]\nLady DeathStriketook control of the Reavers and used them to hunt down Wolverine.[18]\nA few years later, a member of theUpstarts,Trevor Fitzroy, sentSentinelsto destroy the Reavers because they were a threat to mutants and Pierce (as the Hellfire Club's former White King) was worth a lot of points in the deadly game the Upstarts played. Of the Reavers, only Lady Deathstrike andCyllaescaped the Sentinels and it appeared that Pierce had been destroyed.[19]Wolverine went to investigate and found the rest of the Reavers were completely wiped out.[20]\nLady Deathstrike tried to hunt down Logan again in order to extract his Adamantium-laced bones, completely unaware that Logan no longer possessed them since Magneto ripped the unbreakable metal from his body a short time ago. When she learned the truth she reluctantly left in peace.[21]\nThe Reavers were sent to kill Wolverine and the Punisher. The two teamed up and struck back the cybernetic enforcers.[22]\nThey battled theX-Treme X-Menwith a new female;Skullbuster[23]\nAn angry young man namedJosh Foleyjoined the Reavers at the behest of his then best friend, Duncan. WhenCerebradetected a mutant in the area,Dani MoonstarandKarmawere sent to investigate. Meanwhile, the Reavers engaged a group of students from Xavier's in a fight, and Josh discovered he was a healer by healing one of his fellow Reavers. By knocking him out, he was able to hide this for a short time until he felt compelled to heal the mortally-injuredLaurie Collins. Laurie developed a crush on him as a result. When the Reavers discovered Josh was a mutant with healing powers, they rejected him and retreated. Angrily rejecting Moonstar's offer to go to the X-Mansion, he went home, to find his fellow Reavers waiting for him, where they delivered a severe beating, and when his parents discovered he was a mutant, they disowned him.[24]With nowhere else to go, Josh reluctantly went to theXavier Institute. He joined their trainee team theNew Mutants[25]The Reavers came for revenge on Josh but were unsuccessful and he remained at the institute.[26]\nLady DeathStrikemade an oath to the ReverendWilliam Stryker, creator of thePurifiers. She promised to him that in the mutant's darkest hours she would help his Purifiers. She recreated the Reavers.[27]They caught up withCable, just in time for theX-Forceto attack.[28]Lady Deathstrike took onX-23and was seemingly killed. The other Reavers died, but not without killingCalibanfirst.[29]\nAfter being recomposed by Donald Pierce and gathered by Deathstrike, the Reavers assaultedUtopia, before being defeated byX-Force.[30]\nThe Reavers were one one of the many enforcer groups working for theDescendants. Father used the Reavers as enforcers when the attacked theUnited Nations Headquarters.[31]\nCable,Hope, andX-Forcewent on a mission to the Reavers base to stop them from any future attacks on Mutants.[32]\nEvan Sabahnur, the young clone ofApocalypse, was trying to rob a bank when he was interrupted by the Reavers. He noticed a woman was having a heart attack, and used his powers to crush the Reavers with a giant statue of a cat, then rushed the woman to hospital.[33]\nAfter rumors of the return of the recently deceased Wolverine started spreading, the Reavers, lead by Deathstrike, began tracking him down. Unknown to them this was anolder versionof Logan, and the present one was still dead.[34]They eventually found him in the isolated town ofKillhorn Falls, Canada, where Logan was attempting to live a peaceful life.[35]Deathstrike and the Reavers attacked the town, massacring it's inhabitants as revenge against Wolverine. At the end, Logan managed to kill all the Reavers except Deathstrike, who escaped after being seriously injured.[36]\nA contingent of the Reavers led by a recently resurfaced Donald Pierce came to the burial sight where the X-Men left the molten remains of Logan's body. Bonebreaker mockingly chided the adamantium statue while pricking his finger on it's extended claws, they ended up tripping a silent alarm put in place by the crypt holder's friends in the event someone tried to desecrate it.\nA firefight would break out between the X-Men's heavy hitters and the decadent remnants of the bionic mutant killers. Pierce, having taken on the job due to the all time lows he and his crew had hit in the following years, was being paid by an unknown buyer to excavate the fallen Canadian's remains for a handsome sum of money. The decayed cyborgs needed this score desperately. While the rest of their team worked interference between them and their mark, Pierce and Cylla got to work on cracking that dense slag shell surrounding their prize. Cylla had been upgraded with a Molecular Rearranger in order to break the unbreakable alloy surrounding their prize. Despite this, the process that took a lot of time. When they finally succeeded however, the two were disappointed to find Logan's body was no longer there.\nSome time prior to their attempted grave robbery, Kitty had opted to remove Logan from the metallic outer layer he'd been trapped in, eventually giving him a proper burial within another undisclosed location, known only to a select few.[37]\nThe Reavers later reappeared in service of the secretly reinstatedO.N.Eorganization. Where Donald Pierce and his cyber-mercs were deposited into the care of General Robert Callahan after the X-Men left them withAlpha Flight; whom, not being able to do much with them in the first place, left them at the doorstep of the current director of which.[38]\nThey were tasked by their new handler to incarcerateMiss Sinisterin exchange for some bodily refits, upgrades and their freedom.[39]When they completed the task however, the crooked commanding officer revealed he'd rigged their refurbished bionics to short circuit in case they became unruly. Callahan opting to take Pierce and Cylla back to base with them in order to modify their mutant hunting equipment, while ordering the extermination of the rest afterward.[38]\nAfter some time on the run from O.N.E. a contingent of Reavers attackedHankand a visitingAlex Summersat the university the former taught at.[40]Beast would later examine the remains of one of their number to find a list mutant targets given to them by their former employers,[40]while Havok would come clean that the person they were hunting in the first place, was him.\nWith no other options available to them, Alexander accompanied byWarpathwent to the remaining debilitated cyborg mutant killers for aid in rescuing their own. In exchange for the program data hidden within Alex himself, The Reavers found themselves briefly forced to ally with the X-Men to rescue their comrades from a shared enemy.[41]Allegiances which quickly turned sideways as the Reavers predictably betrayed their X ally's the second they deciphered thesecreted codestored in Alex's brain.[42]The same nanobionic code they were fighting with Callahan to ascertain a piece of technoforming program that enabled any mechanical apparatus to override and assimilate any kind of mechanical or cybernetic operational system; be it biological, inorganic, purely motorized, or even Artificial Intelligence.\nWith this new upgrade in tow, the Reavers believed they had killed the X-Men. Eventually they moved on to attack the Xavier Mansion with their newly acquiredsentinel bodies. They were eventually stopped by the still-alive X-Men and were once again incarcerated by O.N.E. shortly afterwards.[43]\nIn the wake of the establishment of the new mutant nation-state of Krakoa, the anti-mutant cabalXENOdeployed a group of artificially-grown and biologically-augmented Reavers to infiltrate Krakoa and assassinateProfessor X. They were successful.[44]However, Xavier would later resurrected by theFive[45]\nLikewise, Donald Pierce threw his lot, and resources, in with an all new anti-mutant gentlemen's club heralded asHomines Verendi.[46]Max Frankensteintook a plethora of ex-military, special forces along with other ne'er-do-well mercenary figures, all of whom that met with catastrophic infraction while battling mutants, into service under Verendi's banner for a personal project.[47]\nHe took these underlings of one bigoted faction or another unto his testing labs, transforming these dregs into a biomechanical augment private army to act as the hate group's personal strikeforce against Krakoa's humanitarian aid set up in the impoverished sections of Madripoor.[48]"

At the end, Logan managed to kill all the Reavers except Deathstrike, who escaped after being seriously injured.[36]\nA contingent of the Reavers led by a recently resurfaced Donald Pierce came to the burial sight where the X-Men left the molten remains of Logan's body. Bonebreaker mockingly chided the adamantium statue while pricking his finger on it's extended claws, they ended up tripping a silent alarm put in place by the crypt holder's friends in the event someone tried to desecrate it.\nA firefight would break out between the X-Men's heavy hitters and the decadent remnants of the bionic mutant killers. Pierce, having taken on the job due to the all time lows he and his crew had hit in the following years, was being paid by an unknown buyer to excavate the fallen Canadian's remains for a handsome sum of money. The decayed cyborgs needed this score desperately. While the rest of their team worked interference between them and their mark, Pierce and Cylla got to work on cracking that dense slag shell surrounding their prize. Cylla had been upgraded with a Molecular Rearranger in order to break the unbreakable alloy surrounding their prize. Despite this, the process that took a lot of time. When they finally succeeded however, the two were disappointed to find Logan's body was no longer there.\nSome time prior to their attempted grave robbery, Kitty had opted to remove Logan from the metallic outer layer he'd been trapped in, eventually giving him a proper burial within another undisclosed location, known only to a select few.[37]\nThe Reavers later reappeared in service of the secretly reinstatedO.N.Eorganization.

The members have been cybernetically enhanced into cyborg enforcers. They later splintered off into their own criminal organization based out ofCooterman's CreekinAustralia.[1]\nThe first members of the Reavers were originally members of theHellfire Knights, the Hellfire Club's private military force. They originally came into being when themutantMastermindattempted to mentally controlJean Greyin a bid to join theHellfire Club's Inner Circle. In the resulting confrontation with theX-Men,Wolverinefell victim toLeland's mass-increasing powers, ending up in the New York sewer system and seemingly dying. Wolverine, very much alive, reentered the club through a secret sub-basement entrance. There, he attacked a group of mercenaries sent to track him down -Wade Cole,Angelo Macon, andMurray Reese- and critically injured them with his claws.[2]These men were eventually recovered and taken to theBody Shop, a shop run bySpiral, a servant ofMojo, that sold alien cybernetic parts to amputees and others who see the power of cybernetic limbs. The men andYuriko Oyamawere converted into cyborgs, becoming the first of the Reavers.[3]\nFirst appearance of the Reavers\nThe original Reavers, which includedBonebreaker,Pretty BoyandSkullbusterset up operations inCooterman's CreekinAustralia, and worked with a local aboriginal man namedGateway. He was a Mutant who could teleport people anywhere across the planet. They used him and their new found upgrades to rob a banks across the world. On one outing toSingaporethey kidnappedJessán Hoan, which lead to theX-Mencoming to her rescue. The X-Men took down the Reavers' operations. In the confusion, Bonebreaker, Skullbuster and Pretty Boy managed to get away and ordered Gateway to teleport them away, telling the Aboriginal that if he does so then his debt to them is paid.[4]\nThe Reavers, officially led byDonald Pierceand working withLady Deathstrike, plotted revenge on the X-Men. They were unaware that they were being watched byNannyand theOrphan-Maker, who wanted the X-Men for themselves.[5]The Reavers practiced their coming attack on the X-Men by beating robot versions of the team. Nanny and the Orphan Maker, knowing of the coming deadly conflict with the Reavers kidnapped the X-Men.[6]They tried to track the X-Men unaware they had been transported to theSavage Land.[7]They captured Wolverine and hung him on a wooden X and tortured him. But later the town came under the fury of a powerful storm that seems to be encircling the whole globe. While the Reavers wait out the tempest inside, Jubilee freed Wolverine and the two escaped.[8]\nThe Reavers found the crucifix empty and searched the base for the escaped Logan. Jubilee and Wolverine attempted to flee the complex before being hunted by the Reavers' cyborg hounds.[9]They escaped from the Reavers base, but the cyborgs pinpointedMuir IslandinScotlandas their most probable destination and planned to invade the island.[10]The two X-Men held off the Reavers the best they could.[11]Freedom Forcearrived as back up to help stop the Reavers attack, but with disastrous consequences to the team:Avalanchewas wounded by Lady Deathstrike and Pierce killedStonewall. Meanwhile Destiny Wass murdered in cold blood by Legion, who also snuffed out Pyro's flame attack at a critical moment in the fight.Forgeturned the battle against the Reavers with a new sniper rifle that was capable of destroying Pierce's cyborgs.Skullbusterwas killed, but the others Reavers escaped.[12]\nIn anAthens,Greece, hospital, Donald Pierce made the horribly injuredCylla Markhaman offer she could not refuse.[13]In California, the Reavers destroyed a facility owned by Emma Frost, the Hellfire Club's White Queen. They intended to destroy as much property of Emma's as they have to, until they finally caught up with her.[14]\nWhenMicrochiptapped into the Reavers computer system, He stole plans to build a combat robot dubbed the \"Dalek\". The group found the hack and decided to seek revenge by trashing thePunisher's safe house and then went after Microchip and Castle.[15]Microchip created thePunisher's Exo-Armorto level the playing the field for Castle against the Reavers.[16]\nRoguewas spat out from theSiege Perilousto land in the former X-Men base in Australia only to learn it had become the HQ of the Reavers. Surprisingly,Carol Danvershad body of her own again and, while she fought the Reavers, Rogue absorbed Gateway's powers long enough to teleport herself and Carol away.[17]\nLady DeathStriketook control of the Reavers and used them to hunt down Wolverine.[18]\nA few years later, a member of theUpstarts,Trevor Fitzroy, sentSentinelsto destroy the Reavers because they were a threat to mutants and Pierce (as the Hellfire Club's former White King) was worth a lot of points in the deadly game the Upstarts played. Of the Reavers, only Lady Deathstrike andCyllaescaped the Sentinels and it appeared that Pierce had been destroyed.[19]Wolverine went to investigate and found the rest of the Reavers were completely wiped out.[20]\nLady Deathstrike tried to hunt down Logan again in order to extract his Adamantium-laced bones, completely unaware that Logan no longer possessed them since Magneto ripped the unbreakable metal from his body a short time ago. When she learned the truth she reluctantly left in peace.[21]\nThe Reavers were sent to kill Wolverine and the Punisher. The two teamed up and struck back the cybernetic enforcers.[22]\nThey battled theX-Treme X-Menwith a new female;Skullbuster[23]\nAn angry young man namedJosh Foleyjoined the Reavers at the behest of his then best friend, Duncan. WhenCerebradetected a mutant in the area,Dani MoonstarandKarmawere sent to investigate. Meanwhile, the Reavers engaged a group of students from Xavier's in a fight, and Josh discovered he was a healer by healing one of his fellow Reavers. By knocking him out, he was able to hide this for a short time until he felt compelled to heal the mortally-injuredLaurie Collins. Laurie developed a crush on him as a result. When the Reavers discovered Josh was a mutant with healing powers, they rejected him and retreated. Angrily rejecting Moonstar's offer to go to the X-Mansion, he went home, to find his fellow Reavers waiting for him, where they delivered a severe beating, and when his parents discovered he was a mutant, they disowned him.[24]With nowhere else to go, Josh reluctantly went to theXavier Institute. He joined their trainee team theNew Mutants[25]The Reavers came for revenge on Josh but were unsuccessful and he remained at the institute.[26]\nLady DeathStrikemade an oath to the ReverendWilliam Stryker, creator of thePurifiers. She promised to him that in the mutant's darkest hours she would help his Purifiers. She recreated the Reavers.[27]They caught up withCable, just in time for theX-Forceto attack.[28]Lady Deathstrike took onX-23and was seemingly killed. The other Reavers died, but not without killingCalibanfirst.[29]\nAfter being recomposed by Donald Pierce and gathered by Deathstrike, the Reavers assaultedUtopia, before being defeated byX-Force.[30]\nThe Reavers were one one of the many enforcer groups working for theDescendants. Father used the Reavers as enforcers when the attacked theUnited Nations Headquarters.[31]\nCable,Hope, andX-Forcewent on a mission to the Reavers base to stop them from any future attacks on Mutants.[32]\nEvan Sabahnur, the young clone ofApocalypse, was trying to rob a bank when he was interrupted by the Reavers. He noticed a woman was having a heart attack, and used his powers to crush the Reavers with a giant statue of a cat, then rushed the woman to hospital.[33]\nAfter rumors of the return of the recently deceased Wolverine started spreading, the Reavers, lead by Deathstrike, began tracking him down.

After setting up home on a private island, getting married and fathering one daughter namedYurikoand two sons, he became the cruel Lord Dark Wind. In a perverse way, Lord Dark Wind scarred his children's faces in the very same way he had his face disfigured.[1]He also had his children privately tutored byMarcy Stryker, wife of an American soldier namedWilliam Stryker. For that reason, the Strykers were acquainted with Yuriko since she was born.[21]In his extremist and insane activities, Lord Dark Wind built a criminal cult empire on his island, employing assassins as followers who he forced to adopt feudal traditions. He had his sons killed in an attempt to assassinate the Japanese prime minister. Concurrently, Yuriko fell in love with one of her father's assassins, a warrior namedKira. As Kira blindly followed Dark Wind's violent ideology, Yuriko grew to despise her father.[1]\nMoreover, Lord Dark Wind also developed a means for bonding the virtually indestructible metalAdamantiumto human bone, a procedure he hoped to use in creating an army of super-soldiers for Japan. However, his notes were mysteriously stolen, demanding him years to recreate the process. Eventually, he contacted theKingpin, wishing to recruit the Kingpin's then-crippled assassinBullseyeto his private army by healing him with Adamantium.[22]In Japan, Dark Wind replaced some of Bullseye's broken bones with Adamantium implants, hoping that in return Bullseye would assassinate Japan's minister of trade for him. Arriving in Japan to capture Bullseye, the blind costumed crime-fighterDaredevilencountered Yuriko in one of her father's ships.[20]Seeking vengeance on her father, for scarring her face, for the deaths of her brothers and for putting Kira in danger, Yuriko guided Daredevil to her father's private island. During the ordeal, Yuriko found in Daredevil a man who was not disgusted by her appearance.[1]After the fight, Bullseye escaped, while Yuriko herself slew Lord Dark Wind as he was about to murder Daredevil. Freed for her diabolical father, Yuriko found herself unable to mourn his death by wishing to enjoy happiness with her lover Kira.[9]\nTragically, following Daredevil's departure, Kira committed suicide in despair over Lord Dark Wind's death. The shock of Kira's death radically altered Yuriko's outlook on life as she resolved to carry on her father's legacy. Yuriko attempted to track down Bullseye, who had fled her father's service without repayment. By tracking his Adamantium skeleton, she inadvertently located the mutant adventurerWolverine, who had gained his Adamantium-laced skeleton by means of the process stolen from Lord Dark Wind years earlier. Garbed as a samurai and calling herselfLady Deathstrike, Oyama led a number of her father's warriors toCanada, where they confronted Wolverine, seeking to retrieve his Adamantium skeleton which was an unrightful product of her father's experiments. She was defeated by Wolverine's long-time friendHeather Hudson, who had adopted the costumed identity of Vindicator in her role as leader of the Canadian super-teamAlpha Flight.[23]\nHaving failed to defeat Wolverine, Lady Deathstrike resolved to better him as his equal. She struck a deal with the eccentricSpiral, who transformed Deathstrike into a cyborg in herBody Shop, healing her facial scars in the process. Lady Deathstrike sacrificed her humanity to recover her honor by becoming a living weapon, being granted with a strong machine body and Adamantium claws to rival Wolverine's own. She teamed up with three other cyborgs who had been wounded by Wolverine in the past -- formerHellfire ClubsoldiersCole,Macon, andReese. Wolverine was brutally assaulted by Deathstrike and her associates, but was assisted by the child super-heroKatie Power. In a one-on-one combat, Wolverine bested Deathstrike, leaving her body in scraps. Again meeting defeat, she begged for Wolverine to mercy kill her, but he refused. She considered her failure in defeating Wolverine another sign of being forever bound to her macabre father.[8]\nDeathstrike and the Reavers\nInterested in vengeance, Deathstrike joinedDonald Pierceand theReaversas part of a plan to recover theReavers basefrom Wolverine's associates, theX-Men.[11]For days, the Reavers prepared themselves to destroy Wolverine and the X-Men by secretly hiding in the Australian outback. Even though Lady Deathstrike's code of honor distinguished her from the other Reavers, she got involved in their affairs to the point of developing a bizarrely abusive relationship with Pierce.[24]\nThe Reavers ambushed Wolverine when the other X-Men were in theSavage Landby getting their base back. By crucifying him on an X-shaped cross, they left him to die in the scorching hot desert. Wolverine was rescued by the young mutantJubilee, who hid him to nurse him back to health.[13]While the Reavers searched for Wolverine, Lady Deathstrike went to his quarters and found one of the Reavers,Pretty Boy, using Wolverine's Honor Sword of theYashida Clanto destroy some dear belongings. Despite her hatred for Wolverine, as a daimyo noble warrior, Deathstrike confronted Pretty Boy and decided to protect the blade by hiding it where Jubilee had nursed Wolverine, until her foe would claim it back upon her death or vice-versa.[25]Wolverine and Jubilee managed to escape from the Reavers after a brief clash. The pair was later spotted from afar by Lady Deathstrike. However, she chose not to attack them as there would be no honor in striking down a foe from ambush when he was too weak to defend himself. She ultimately let Wolverine escape by expecting to meet him again as an equal on a field of honor.[26]\nPierce believed that Wolverine had fled to themutant research facilityrun byMoira MacTaggertonMuir Island.[26]The Reavers made their move and clashed with botha ragtag groupof X-Men and the U.S. government-sponsoredFreedom Force. Deathstrike severely wounded the mutantAvalancheduring the fight. After both sides suffered casualties, the tide of battle turned against the Reavers, who retreated by teleporting away.[27]The Reavers kept searching for Wolverine by concurrently causing distress for their adversaries.[28]After recruitingCylla Markhamto become a cyborg, Deathstrike alerted her of the consequences of losing her humanity.[29]\nHoping to succeed alone after her failures with a team, Deathstrike tracked Wolverine by herself. InOsaka, she acquired information about his whereabouts. She had the Reavers' enslaved ally, the mutant aborigineGateway, teleport her toMadripoor, where she blackmailedTygerinto revealing Wolverine's location. Forcing Gateway to bring her toVancouver, Deathstrike finally found Wolverine, but was tricked by Gateway, who teleported her, Wolverine and his allyPuckback in time to 1937 in Spain. Caught in a skirmish during the Spanish Civil War, Deathstrike was met by the naziCaptain Schlachter.[30]Schlachter and his men tried to eliminate Deathstrike with no success. She saw her stay in the past as an opportunity to prevent her father from becoming the disfigured Lord Dark Wind which would save her from her disgraced fate. In order to achieve it, she joined forces with Schlachter to capture Wolverine, offering him to weaponize Adamantium on her foe's bones.[31]\nDuring a one-on-one fight against Wolverine, Schlachter accidentally jeopardized Oyama's tactics by tearing her arm off. Enraged, she violently stroke back at her ally mortally wounding him. Gateway's powers eventually returned all of the time-travelers to the present in a vortex. As Deathstrike battled Wolverine, they kept traveling across time. Fearing about the damage her activies caused to the timestream, Pierce had Deathstrike teleported back to their base, interrupting her vendetta.[32]Back home, Lady Deathstrike had her arm rebuilt by the Reavers.[33]\nStill acting solo, Lady Deathstrike went toNew York City, where she planned to lure Wolverine into a trap by associating herself withRonald Parvenue, who carried out a display of abestial creaturein public. This attracted not only the attention of Wolverine but also ofSabretooth.[34][35]Both Deathstrike and Sabretooth attacked Wolverine after he revealed himself. During the fight, Lady Deathstrike was furtively shot and incapacitated byEmmy Doolin, but was rescued by Parvenue.[36]\nWith Parvenue's help, Deathstrike located Wolverine once again. In Canada, she found him alongside Heather Hudson and Puck.[37]During the violent fight, Wolverine exhibited his bone claws no longer coated in Adamantium, as the metal had been forcibly removed from his body byMagneto. As a consequence, Lady Deathstrike lost interest in her quest for vengeance and recovering her birthright. As she left in search of purpose, she crossed paths with Cylla andBloodscream, who were also pursuing Wolverine, and refused to join them.[38]\nPierce eventually rebuilt the Reavers, giving Deathstrike self-repairing assets. Under his orders, she capturedDr. Milo Thurman, a former government employee who possessed incredible natural prophetic abilities, from a secret facility.[39]As Thurman's former wife,Dominointervened, she directly confronted Deathstrike. With her mutant based luck powers, Domino detonated a bomb that destroyed most of Deathstrike's body.[40]She was rebuilt by Pierce, who intended to transform Thurman into a cyborg Reaver under his control. The plan was foiled by Domino, who escaped the Reavers and managed to throw Deathstrike into an acid pool, although at the cost of Thurman's life.[41]\nGoing after Wolverine's loved ones\nStriking out on her own, Lady Deathstrike once again clashed with Wolverine over an ancient casket that belonged to her family. Wolverine was unwillingly in possession of the artefact, and Deathstrike settled for a truce to investigate the mystery behind it. However, during the mission, Deathstrike's body was possessed by the spirit of Wolverine's former sensei and current enemy,Lord Ogun.[42]Eventually abandoned by the spirit once it had learned from her how to infiltrate cybernetic systems, Deathstrike subsequently allied with the Japanese terrorist groupStrikeforce Ukiyoeand they clashed with the super-soldier Captain America following his return from an extradimensional exile.[43]\nShe next found herself targeted byPrime Sentinels, mutant-hunting cyborgs under the command of the time-traveling villainStryfe. Although not a mutant herself, Deathstrike's bionic design carried the same schematics of the cyborg's original designer's implement. Meaning she unknowingly carried within her cybernetic programming the control codes for the activation and commandeering of the Zero Tolerance project's far more powerful Omega Prime-class Sentinels. With the help of Wolverine and his teammates in the X-Men, Deathstrike defeated Stryfe and his forces.[44]\nDespite their shared victory, Deathstrike's dislike for Wolverine endured, and Wolverine's arch-nemesis subsequently recruited her, the feral mutantSabretooth, to assist him in striking at Wolverine's loved ones in exchange for valuable information. Deathstrike, alongside the Russian super-soldierOmega Red, crippled Wolverine's friendYukioand abducted his ward,Amiko. Having obtained what he wanted, Sabretooth subsequently double-crossed Deathstrike and Omega Red, cheating them out of the information he had promised them.[45]\nLady Deathstrike and Wolverine blood feud\nDeathstrike later worked for a mafia mobster named Nicopetti, the most powerful Oyuban in all of Kobe and who considered her like a daughter and his most deadly weapon. After succeeding in completing all of her assignments she asked for his help into killing Wolverine but he refused, saying that Deathstrike had made the mistake to go after Logan's family and now she was doomed and he didn't want any part of this. Instead Nicopetti gave Deathstrike money and a new identification so she could flee away before Wolverine killed her. Angry by what Nicopetti said, she scarred him face and threw him through a window just as Wolverine confronted her. She decided to run away but Wolverine went after her, angry after what Deathstrike did to Yukio and Amiko when she was working for Sabretooth.\nAfter catching up to her, Logan drew his samurai sword and gave another samurai sword to Deathstrike, he then told her that if they were going to end this feud, they needed to do it with honor and not as wild animals, but as samurai. Deathstrike grabbed the sword and started to fight him. Wolverine gained the upper hand, and as Deathstrike fell to the ground he lowered his guard and told her to give up but Deathstrike wasn't done, she impaled Wolverine on her sword and grabbed his heart with her claws but she couldn't tear it apart thanks to Wolverine's adamantium bones. Wolverine then told her to kill him but Deathstrike couldn't do it, Wolverine then pushed her away, and started to slash her several times with his sword, cutting her claws but he refused to kill her, saying she was sick and needed help and that their blood feud was over. Wolverine then left her with a samurai sword, just as Nicopetti and his men arrived to get their revenge on Deathstrike after what she did to Nicopetti but Wolverine told them it was their funeral. As Nicopetti's men approached, Deathstrike rose to her feet, grabbed her sword and was now ready to face them.[46]\nHelping William Stryker\nLady Deathstrike later went to the aid of her former associateWilliam Stryker, who had since become a minister and led an anti-mutant crusade that resulted in his imprisonment due to the murderous actions of his Purifiers soldiers. Breaking him out of government custody, Deathstrike gave him access to the resources of Oyama Heavy Industries. In the course of aiding Stryker in his efforts, she fell under the control of Paul, a sentient computer entity who sought to protect the community of mutants living in Mount Haven. Under Paul's control, Deathstrike fought both Stryker and the X-Men, once more dueling with Wolverine and, ironically, meeting more success under Paul's control than she ever had on her own. In the course of one clash, Deathstrike was buried beneath collapsing rubble, but when the X-ManBishopinvestigated he found only her severed cybernetic arm.[47]\nLater on, Lady Deathstrike discovered that she was suffering from missing memories but thanks to her improved technologies, her C.P.U reconstructed them and she discovered thatMystique,Rogue, Sunfire, andBlindspotstole Lord Dark Wind's adamantium process a long time ago. Angry after that discovery, Deathstrike captured Blindspot who was responsible for her missing memories and used her to publicly leaked that Sunfire was affiliated with Rogue, Blindspot and Mystique back when they were part of the Marauders, in order to lure Rogue to Japan.\nGoing after Rogue\nAfter Rogue arrived in Japan, Deathstrike attacked her but she was able to escape, Rogue then teamed up with Sunfire in order to confront Deathstrike. In the ensuing battle, Sunfire's powers triggered the sprinkler system, filling the room with steam. Lady Deathstrike moved behind him and severed his legs from his body and then captured both Sunfire and Rogue. She then learned that Rogue, Mystique, Sunfire and Blindspot never managed to recover the schematics of her father's adamantium bonding process, seeing no use for them anymore she decided to kill them but Rogue was able to absorb the powers of Sunfire and was now too powerful for Deathstrike who decided to run away.[48]\nDuring the Superheroes Civil War, after a battle between the Pro and the Anti Registration forces,Goliathwas killed by acloneofThorAs a result, the Pro-Registration side lost more members than anticipated, necessitating a fast-tracking of the50-State Initiative. TheCSA, with help fromSongbird, gathered several ex-villains as part of a newThunderbolts team, Lady Deathstrike was among those villains and was now working alongside the betrayer of her father, Bullseye.[49]\nTracking the unregistered heroes\nTheir goal was to capture the underground \"Secret Avengers\" but to make sure nothing went wrong,Mister Fantastictagged each member with nanites to monitor their actions. Before fighting as a unit,Jack O'Lanternand theJesterwere deployed to captureSpider-Manwho just switched sides, but they were killed by thePunisher.[50]Not long after, the Pro and the Anti Registration forces in a super-prison located in theNegative Zonewhere several unregistered superhuman were held prisoners. Lady Deathstrike assisted Iron Man and the other heroes from the Registration forces against Captain America and the anti-Registration forces.[51]\nDuring the battle, she fought against Spider-Man alongsideVenomuntilCloakteleported everyone back to New York City, she then teamed up with Venom,Taskmasterand Bullseye and beat Captain America down. As Yuriko and Bullseye were mocking Captain America, they were suddenly attacked by the army forces ofAtlantisandNamorwho took them down. She was later sent back to her cell in the the super prison of the Negative Zone.[52]\nTracking the Messiah baby\nShe resurfaced with a second incarnation of the Reavers, who had allied with thePurifiers. When theNew X-Menattacked, she mortally woundedHellion.[53]The New X-Men barely escaped alive. The Reavers then went forCable, who had the messiah baby.[54]While they attacked,X-Force, attacked as well.X-23went against Deathstrike, ending with X-23 defeating her and apparently killing her.[55]\nDeathstrike was apparently repaired bySpiralin herBody Shop. While Spiral repaired Deathstrike's body, she also gave her a more submissive personality, as she continually did whatever she is told, while referring to Spiral as \"Mistress\".[56]\nSpiral and Deathstrike joinedMadelyne Pryor a.k.a the Red Queen'sSisterhood of Mutants. After the Sisterhood resurrectedKwannonusing the life-force ofPsylocke, they finally made their move on theX-Men.[14]Deathstrike was tasked to take downWolverine, by piercing his lungs. Deathstrike kept Wolverine busy while the Sisterhood raided his room for one of his most treasured possessions: a lock ofJean Grey's hair. After the team was defeated by the X-Men and the Red Queen died, Deathstrike escaped through one Spiral's portals.[57]\nShe led a Reaver attack on Utopia that was thwarted by X-Force,[58]and later fought and killedKangaroowhile working forDoctor Octopusand his plan of world domination.[59]\nLady Deathstrike was then seen in Madripoor, Lowtown with her brother,Lord Deathstrike, they both had been invited alongside several villains to a party organized by Sabretooth. But Wolverine heard about it and decided to crash this party, he then defeated Lady Deathstrike, her brother and the other villains present before wishing an \"Happy Birthday\" to Sabretooth as a revenge for what he did to him in the past.[4]\nLady Deathstrike joined the being known asFatherand his crossing along theDescendantsto claim the domain of the world for the robots, as she was a cyborg.[60]She took part in the final raid onNew York City.[61]\nDealing with Wolverine's death\nNot long after, Lady Deathstrike and other people possessing adamantium became targets ofAbraham Corneliuswho had just restarted a new Weapon X program and was trying to secure every piece of adamantium in the world, as a result Lady Deathstrike was now tracked by one of his agent: Ogun. Yuriko managed to go to Madripoor where she saved Wolverine from Sabretooth and asked for his help against Ogun, but she then discovered that Wolverine didn't have any healing factor anymore, he was defective. She decided to use this opportunity to capture the weakened Wolverine in order to trade him for her freedom. As she was about to attack Wolverine, Yuriko was attacked by Ogun who was now possessing the body of Kitty Pryde, Ogun easily defeated her and destroyed her hand with the phasing powers of Kitty Pryde.\nOgun then told her to go, as Cornelius tasked him to bring him Wolverine's alive and because Ogun wanted to possess Wolverine's body.[62][63]\nNot long after Wolverine died fighting Cornelius and she was now free, but after her foe's death she discovered that the Honor Blade of Clan Yashida which belonged to Wolverine had been stolen by the Yakuza. Just like she did years ago,[25]she decided to get the sword back and made sure that it was now safe not for pity or kindness for her old foe but in order to maintain ritual and tradition. Once done, she was now free to be the blade of her own mark and making.[64]\nBut not long after, Lady Deathstrike was kidnapped with several other people includingMystique, Sabretooth,X-23,Daken, andElixirbyShogun.[65]\nThe Wolverines team\nLady Deathstrike found that their kidnapper was a mysterious man named Shogun who threatened them with the “control words” that could manipulate, sedate or even kill each of them in order to force them into helping him and his group of allies find the adamantium-petrified body of Wolverine in the burnt-down Paradise facility. Before they could leave on this mission however, they were attacked bySiphon, who killed Elixir and drained Daken's healing factor to nonfunctional. They proceeded with the mission, and Daken and X-23 initially kept Daken's inability to heal a secret from their impromptu teammates. They encountered and fought theWrecking Crew, hired byMister Sinister, who were also looking for Wolverine's body. When Daken and X-23 found the body, Mister Sinister appeared, took Wolverine's body, and also ripped an eye and arm from Daken,[66]and left bleeding out and not healing.[66]\nAfter they failed in their mission to retrieve Wolverine's body, Mystique then declared herself as the leader of the team, and made Sharp help her retrieve thezhulong, or sun dragon, onTaipei, Mystique then revealed to Sharp than Lady Deathstrike was attracted to him and then tricked Sharp into revealing her control words to her. Ogun then ordered Sharp to go back to Sinister and to work for him so he could help him stop the genetic time bomb put inside of him but suddenly Deathstrike appeared and attacked Sharp. During the fight, Ogun took control of Sharp body, and was able to counter Lady Deathstrike which shocked her asking how did Sharp do this move, Ogun answered: \"You know how\". Lady Deathstrike recognized Ogun and started to kiss him but they were interrupted by the arrival ofFangwho was seeking revenge for Logan's death.[67][67]\nDespite putting up a brave fight the team was defeated by Fang, who then decided to take each one of them one by one on a trip to honor Logan's memory but also to punish them for what they did to him when he was alive starting with Daken. But the team decided to find a way to beat Fang before he came back.[68]Back on the Changeling, Sharp' and Lady Deathstrike' relationship started to blossom, Yuriko then mentioned that Sharp reminded her of an old lover: Ogun, Sharp revealed to her that Ogun's spirit was in his head. Sharp then fell to sleep, while asleep Ogun then took over his body once again and talked to Yuriko and the two started to plan how to have Ogun fully control Sharp's body.[69]\nYuriko and Ogun then started to work together in order for her to free him, to that end she decided to train ferociously with Sharp, the training over, Sharp being tired fell asleep and once again Ogun took control of Sharp's body and spoke with her. He then told Lady Deathstrike to fight Sharp in order to exhaust him physically and mentally which would result in Sharp's spirit becoming weak. But under no circumstances she should kill him or she would kill Ogun, but with Sharp on the brink of death Ogun could finally took over his body completely and the two of them would be finally reunited. Lady Deathstrike then started to ferociously attacked Sharp.[70][71]\nLady Deathstrike ready to free Ogun\nLady Deathstrike fought against Sharp and seriously wounded him, making him lose a lot blood, during the fight Ogun finally revealed the truth to Sharp and how they set him up. As Sharp was about to give up and with Ogun about to finally take over his body, Fang returned and was attacked by the rest of the team who this time overpowered him. But before being defeated Fang teleported away with Sharp just as Lady Deathstrike was about to strike him with one last blow that would have allowed Ogun to take over Sharp body completely.\nAfter being teleported to an unnamed planet by Fang, Ogun tried one last push to take over Sharp's body but Fang stopped him and put Ogun away allowing Sharp to take control of his own body again before being sent back to the Changeling where Yuriko discovered that Ogun was now gone.[72]\nLater on after the team attacked Sinister's fortress, Sharp was fatally injured when he saved Yuriko from a dangerous attack revealing to her that his feelings for her were real, which changed the way Yuriko was looking at him. On the brink of death, Sharp lost consciousness allowing Ogun to take control of his body once again.[73][74]With Sharp's body under his control, Ogun faced against Sinister but during their fight Sinister revealed that he discovered how to cure the genetic time bomb implanted in Sharp body and understood that Sharp's proximity to death was what allowed Ogun to take control of his body. Using a syringe with the cure inside of it, Sinister then used it on Shogun, curing Sharp of his condition and as a result allowing Sharp to take control of his body and locking Ogun's spirit away once more.[74]\nThe team was then betrayed by Mystique who, thanks to Siphon, drained Sabretooth, X-23 and Lady Deathstrike's healing factors. Mystique was the only one left with an healing factor, so the team used Siphon to track her in order to get their revenge. After finding her, Lady Deathstrike killed Siphon and the team confronted Mystique, but she proved to be too powerful for them and she single-handily defeated all of them by making them fight each other. In the midst of the battle, a powerful bond formed between Sharp and Yuriko who decided to not attack each other, but Mystique still defeated them.[75]\nSome time later, Lady Deathstrike heard the news that Logan was back, she decided to investigate and discovered anold Wolverine also known as Old Man Loganbeing alive so she decided to reform the Reavers and went after him.[76]She tracked Old Man Logan toKillhorn Fallswhere her Reavers started to massacre people. But the old man killed all of her Reavers after a brutal battle before confronting her.[77][76]Still thinking that this old man was the Logan she once knew, Deathstrike became angry that Logan cheated death, she decided to take hostage a young girl,Maureen, andher mother, and told Logan to choose which one she was going to kill. Thanks to the intervention of a sheriff, the two were saved and Logan confronted her.\nFacing Old Man Logan\nBut the old man was too slow against Lady Deathstrike who stabbed him several times and almost killed him, thinking her opponent was beaten she turned her attention to the sheriff who previously shot her but the old man wasn't beaten, he rose to his feet and cut both of her arms and started to dismember her. Because of his wounds, the old man couldn't finish Deathstrike and despite missing several limbs she was able to escape.[76]\nNow on the run from Old Man Logan who was tracking her as a revenge for what she did, Deathstrike got captured by a strange group called theSilent Orderand their leader,General Soheibefore being transported to a remote village nearTokyo. She was then put into a cell and chained to a wall in order to lure Old Man Logan, that the Silent Order wanted to capture, as a result Old Man Logan fell into the Silent Order's trap and was captured as well.[78]\nOld Man Logan was then thrown in a pit while Lady Deathstrike was put in a cage, but after the old man escaped,[78]he decided to free her and despite her hatred for the Old Man Deathstrike decided to team up with him in order to face the Silent Order's army together.[79]After defeating their army, the duo was confronted by Sohei, angry after being caged and used as bait by Sohei, Lady Deathstrike decided to fight him alone but she was defeated. Sohei was then confronted by Old Man Logan who defeated him but in the end the old man was subdued by the Master of the Silent Order, a mutant child known asSilent Monk.[79]\nAfter seeing a vision of the future where Old Man Logan killed him and his army, he decided to thrown both Lady Deathstrike and Old Man Logan in a pit. The Silent Monk decided to kill the old man in front of Lady Deathstrike's eyes by throwing him into the pit over and over again with his telekinetic powers. But having had enough of this torture, Lady Deathstrike grabbed an arrow that was laying at the bottom of the pit and threw it into the Silent Monk's thigh, causing him to fall into the pit with them. Old Man Logan then threatened to kill the boy if Sohei didn't let them come out.[80]\nThinking they won, Lady Deathstrike told Logan she owed him one and he responded that if they got out of this, he would made her an X-Man, but she responded that she wouldn't join his club even if she was paid and besides, she knew that Logan was bluffing, he would never hurt a kid. But suddenly, the Silent Monk unleashed his full power and transformed into a giant creature, blowing up the pit and Lady Deathstrike and Old Man Logan with it. Having had enough of this, Deathstrike tried to confront the Silent Monk, but he unleashed a giant explosion that blew her away.\nOld Man Logan then convinced the young boy to read his mind, assuring the future he came from and where the Silent Monk died would never come true, the young boy then understood that Sohei had been manipulating him. After subduing Sohei and the remaining Silent Order ninja, Logan put a call toS.H.I.E.L.D.and offered to take the Silent Monk to X-Haven, an offer that he accepted while Lady Deathstrike escaped.[81]\nLady Deathstrike joining the Weapon X team\nAfter the fight with the Silent Order, Yuriko decided to stay hidden for a while, but she was tracked down and captured by the resurfacedWeapon Xas part of the organization's process to refine their mutant-hunting cyborgs.[82]She was eventually rescued from containment by a team of mutants led by Old Man Logan who all had been targeted by Weapon X.[17]William Stryker was behind this new Weapon X project and with the help ofDoctor Albathey created a new weapon by combining the DNA of the members of the team andAmadeus Cho a.k.a The Totally Awesome Hulk, something calledWeapon H. Following the destruction of the Weapon X facility where Weapon H had been created, the team of mutants turned their alliance into a mutant-rescue squad, and started by taking back the nameWeapon X.[18][83]\nAfter finding Weapon H, the team was beaten by this new weapon,[84][85]and soon after they discovered that Stryker had also been beat down by this new weapon after being betrayed by Doctor Alba. Stryker survived his encounter with Weapon H because he had been transformed into a cyborg previously, he decided to help the team locate Weapon H as revenge against Doctor Alba.[86]With the help of their new prisoner, the team was able to locate Weapon H[87]and broke Alba's control over him. Now free, Weapon H escaped while Doctor Alba was handed to the X-Men and kept as a prisoner but during the battle with Weapon H, Stryker escaped and started a small church afterwards.[88]\nDeathstrike having her own agenda\nNot long after the team went toSanto Marcoin order to deal with its dictatorEmilio Duarteand hisNuke Platoonwho were exterminating mutants and mutant sympathizers.[89]Along the way, the team came acrossNukeand discovered the supply factory of the Nuke Platoon.[89]After being betrayed by Nuke,[90]the team was forced to take theNuke pillsin order to face Nuke and his platoon before blowing up the factory while Nuke escaped and assassinated Duarte putting an end to this threat. Afterwards, Lady Deathstrike revealed to Sabretooth that she decided to keep some of the pills used by the Nuke Platoon for herself in case she didn't want to play a hero anymore, Sabretooth smiled at this reveal and agreed with her.[91]\nShortly after, Lady Deathstrike and others people whose powers were similar to Wolverine such as Laura Kinney, Old Man Logan, Sabretooth and Daken came under threat of the clandestine organization calledThe Orphans of X.[92]Lady Deathstrike, Sabretooth, Daken and Old Man Logan were captured and executed by the Orphans of X with bullets created with the metal of theMuramasa Bladethat could nullify their healing factor.[5]The bullets were later removed by Laura Kinney, resulting in their resurrection and after discovering the reasons behind the Orphans of X's hatred of them, Laura managed to reason with them and reach an armistice.[6]\nA deadly hunt\nAfter hearing reports that Wolverine might be alive, Lady Deathstrike teamed up with Sabretooth and then contacted Daken, the duo asked him to help them investigate Logan's possible return and in case he was alive to kill him once again, Daken agreed and joined them. Using data from military satellites, the team tracked down an adamantium signature similar to Logan's inMaybelleand discovered that a company named Soteira was conducting experiments there which resulted in the town being infested withzombies.[93]Along the way the trio discovered that their healing factor weren't working and that the bites of those zombies could be lethal to them.[3]On top of zombies, a Soteira kill team composed of two soldiers attacked the trio. Much to Yuriko's surprise one of the soldiers was revealed to be her dead father: Lord Dark Wind.[94]\nShocked by this reveal, Lady Deathstrike lower her guard and was stabbed and fell to the ground at the mercy of her father. As Lord Dark Wind was about to kill her, Daken intervened and fought against him but he was no match for Dark Wind who killed him. Regaining her senses, Yuriko was able to avoid a zombie's attack and confronted her father, she understood that the adamantium signature she's been tracking wasn't Logan but her father the whole time. As she tried to reason with her father and understand what was going on, he attacked her once again, during their fight she discovered that he was only repeating the same words over and over: \"You will be useful\" and kept attacking her. In the midst of the battle, Lord Dark Wind cut Yuriko's left hand off with his sword prompting Yuriko to stab him in the neck with her claws, resulting in her father dropping his sword and stop attacking her.\nShe then went after Sabretooth and stabbed his assailant in the neck as well, Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth then decided to leave Daken's dead body behind and later found a strange green glowing device responsible for suppressing their healing factor.[95]Running out of time after learning that the town was about to be burned to the ground by Soteira, Sabretooth destroyed the device, and as a result their healing powers returned. The next day Yuriko and Sabretooth hijacked a car and left the town. Unknown to Lady Deathstrike, Sabretooth later contacted Kitty Pryde and he gave her the details of what happened in Maybelle because he wanted to atone for his past sins.[96]\nLady Deathstrike as a member of Weapon X-Force\nQuickly after Logan ceded field leadership to Sabretooth due to his ailing health, Lady Deathstrike became aware of Victor's intentions to return to his mercenary ways, and expressed her interest in joining him.[97]After the recruitment of Omega Red,Warpathquit the team due to his disagreement with Sabretooth's behavior,[98]Victor successfully shifted the team's modus operandi to become mercenaries.[99]\nAfter several successful missions, the team decided to rescueMonet, who had fallen under the influence of a cult secretly led byMentallo.[100]After freeing Monet and being joined byDeadpool, the team decided to take down the cult and discovered that its real leader was William Stryker.[101]Along the way the team was captured and forced to fight in an arena against several mutants put under the control of Mentallo but thanks to the Nuke pills that Lady Deathstrike kept after the Santa Marco mission, they were able to free all the mutants from Mentallo's control and killed Stryker.[102]But After learning that Stryker went toHelland planned to return, the team decided to go to Hell in order to deal with him once and for all, to that end they went to seeAzazel.[103]After a brief fight with him, he agreed to send them to Hell,[104]the team was then able to stop Stryker but as the cost of Sabretooth sacrificing his life. Unknown to the team, a feral Sabretooth free of the inversion and back to his older self was later sent back to the land of the living bythe Devil.[19]\nLady Deathstrike was seen at the Criminal Technology Show Expo alongside several other supervillains. WhenKing Cobrarevealed thatIron ManandM.O.D.O.K.were in attendance while disguised as other villains, Lady Deathstrike joined in the ensuing brawl.[105]\nLady Deathstrike attempted to steal theEquinox Bladefrom the British Museum and used it to steal the souls of the security guards. She was stopped byShang-Chiwho punched her out of the window. Afterwards, he broke the blade which returned the souls of the security guards back to their bodies. Lady Deathstrike was next seen holding part of the broken blade which was glowing with energy.[106]\nDesiring to join theAtelier, an elite assassins guild that her brother was a high-ranking member of, Yuriko was partnered withDeadpool-- to her dismay -- and assignedValentine Vuongas a handler. Ordered to assassinateDoctor Octopus, Yuriko was furious when Deadpool failed to rendezvous with her and set out to complete the mission on her own.[107]Finding Deadpool had been captured byHarrower-- who had allied with Doctor Octopus -- and implanted with a clone of theCarnage symbiote, Yuriko was livid to discover he hadn't even noticed he'd been partnered with her due to being smitten with Valentine. While Deadpool was able to escape, Yuriko learned that they had failed the mission due to taking too long and was denied membership to the Atelier.[108]\nLady Deathstrike possesses various superhuman attributes as a result of allowing herself to be transformed into a cyborg.\nAdamantium Skeleton and Claws:Lady Deathstrike's skeleton has been infused withAdamantium. As a result, her bones have been rendered virtually unbreakable. Her fingers have been replaced with 12 inch Adamantium claws that she is capable of extending to twice that length. Her claws are capable of cutting almost any known material, with the exceptions of Adamantium itself andCaptain America's Shield. Her ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force she can exert and the thickness of the substance."

Nga and Leong kept asking David about his powers before he joined Wolverine's self-defense class, which both Sofia and Laurie were also attending. David sat next to Kevin, against Julian's advice. Then, Wolverine picked David to fight him in front of the class and the new student was able to defeat the instructor. After the class, David explained to Wolverine how his powers, which he lacked control over, allowed him to win the fight. Sofia and Laurie invited Kevin to lunch, then, he invited David to lunch.\nThe four students were joined by Xi'an and Dani at their lunch table. They learned that Dani was tasked with recruiting another mutant in New York. Sofia, who knew that Derek was also in New York, insisted that she and Laurie come along and Kevin insisted that he and David come along, as well.\nWalter scolded Derek for contacting Sofia, moments before both of them were abducted by the Reavers. Meanwhile, Sofia, Laurie, David, and Kevin arrived at the hotel, where they were supposed to meet Derek, while Xi'an and Dani left. The four students waited almost an hour, while the two former students searched the Reavers' Meeting Hall, where they detected their potential new student. After getting tired of waiting, Sofia approached the clerk at the hotel lobby and received a letter to meet them at the parking garage.\nUpon arrival, they learned it was a trap set out by the Reavers. Sofia used her powers to attack two Reavers, Duncan and Josh, cutting the former. Then, the four students set out to rescue Walter and Derek, while Josh, who learned of his own mutant powers, unintentionally healed Duncan, who was shocked. As Josh tried to flee, he encountered Pierce. Laurie used her power to share her feelings of fear with the Reavers, causing them to flee. However, her power was also effecting Kevin, as well, moments before Pierce stabbed her from behind with his blade."

Overseen by theGamesmaster, the Upstarts would each try to kill as many mutants as possible and the Gamesmaster would award points based on the mutant's power, skills, and general significance in the world. At times he would raise the value of certain mutants so that the Upstarts would all try to assassinate them. At other times Gamesmaster would also reward the death of non-mutants. To gain entry to the Upstarts competition the requirement was to kill a member of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, but later members were not required to do so; usually the Gamesmaster claimed that their participation would make the game more interesting. The member with the most points at the end of the competition would win \"the prize\". It was never explicitly stated what the prize was (though a statement byAndrea StruckerinX-Men(Vol. 2) #4and a notation on the back of the Upstarts' X-Men Series I trading card state that the prize was immortality), but it was inferred that the winner would gain control over the other contestants as well as gain a lot of power and influence.[citation needed]\nShinobi Shawtook the early lead by killing his fatherSebastian Shaw. He celebrated with a group of contestants who were never seen again afterward. The time-travelerTrevor Fitzroygained membership with the deaths ofDonald Pierceand theReavers. He demanded the ring that signified leadership of the Upstarts from Shaw, but Shaw refused, claiming that he still had more points. Fitzroy would go on to kill theHellions, butFabian Cortezapplied for membership and immediately took first place in the competition for the death ofMagneto.[citation needed]\nThe German twinsFenristried to join the competition and gain an advantage by resurrectingOmega Red. Their plan failed though and they named only probational members by the Gamesmaster.Graydon Creedjoined as well, using the moniker Tribune, and despite not succeeding killing anyone, the Gamesmaster gave him full membership. Trevor Fitzroy had met a woman in the future, namedSienna Blaze, who had told him where she would be one day. Fitzroy knew that Blaze had incredible mutant powers and told her that the Gamesmaster invited her to join the Upstarts.[citation needed]\nOver the next few months, the Upstarts would try to kill as many mutants and other important people (likeMoira MacTaggert)as possible, but with no success. In an attempt to reinvigorate the competition, the Gamesmaster started theYounghunt: the new targets were all surviving members of theNew Mutantsand Hellions. Instead of killing them, the Gamesmaster demanded that they should capture the targets. This competition brought the Upstarts into conflict with theNew WarriorsandX-Force. At the end of the game, the Upstarts had captured most of their targets, butPaige Guthrieconvinced the Gamesmaster to play another game: instead of killing mutants, the Upstarts should try to find and train young mutants like herself. The Gamesmaster was intrigued and canceled the competition. The Upstarts disbanded shortly afterward.[citation needed]\nYears later the Upstarts resurfaced to start the game that they created long ago. They killed members of theNasty Boysin order to lure outCyclopsand his ragtag team ofX-MentoWashington Heights. After a brief moment of words, the two groups engaged each other in battle. The X-Men gained the upperhand as the Upstarts retreated but Shinobi was left behind. Not wanting to get captured, Shaw mentioned that he wasn't going to be controlled by the Hellfire Club so he phased his hand into head and then solidified it resulting in his death.[1]\nIt is revealed that the remaining members had been captured byO*N*E, which eventually led to the deaths ofSiena BlazeandTrevor Fitzroy. This led to the team's disbandment.[2]"

As they search around the complex they come across the ashen remains of Cole, Bonebreaker and Reese and a number of heavily damaged Sentinels from the future. As they look around Jubilee finds the location where she hid out when she was accidentally teleported to Australia just before she joined the X-Men. This triggers a memory of when she found Wolverine crucified[2]and becomes upset and wants to leave. Logan wants to continue searching and they come across the ruins of the lab where Donald Pierce made his cyborgs and note that the tanks with the fluid used to make his creations is leaking out. When they find that it's pouring on a deactivated Sentinel surrounded by some live wires, Jubilee convinces Logan to kill the power. As they continue to search, they are completely unaware of the fact that the Sentinel that has been soaking in the fluid has reactivated and detected them and is beginning it's prime directive to eliminate all mutants.\nAs Logan and Jubilee wander the halls, they come across a severely damaged cyborg dingo that Pierce used to employ and Wolverine puts it out of it's misery. As Jubilee and Wolverine leave to go find Gateway to teleport them back home, the Sentinel begins a repair sequence, cannibalizing parts from the Reavers lab and recharging itself from the generator that powers the base. Detecting that it's two targets have moved outside, the Sentinel goes out there to find them.\nOutside at the mound that Gateway usually perches himself on, Wolverine and Jubilee finds that he is gone, but there is a large time space vortex in his place. Peering Gateway through the vortex, Jubilee reaches out to try and touch him despite Logan's warnings. Jubilee finds herself pulled into the vortex, but Wolverine grabs her legs and tries to pull her out. Jubilee's body materializes partway out of the television at her family home prior to her parents death. Her parents are upset at her sudden appearance and wonder if this is a display of her mutant powers. Jubilee realizes she has appeared on the day that her parents died in a car crash and tries to warn them not to go out on a drive to Mulholland Drive. They ignore her and when the door bell rings, Jubilee witnesses as two armed men named Reno and Molokai have come to kill a Dr. Lee. Taking them at gun point the two thugs plot to take them for a \"ride\". When Jubilee attempts to stop them with her mutant powers, they shoot at her, but she is pulled out of the vortex by Logan. Back in the present, Jubilee demands that Logan let her go back and prevent her parents death. Logan holds her back and she blasts him in the face with her powers, and stops when she realizes what she's done. Logan tells her that you can't change the past. Logan then comforts his companion as she bursts into tears.\nThe Sentinel, meanwhile, has come to the surface and upon gazing at the stars it feels wonderment and realizes that it has gained sentience. While back at the mound, Jubilee tells Logan that what she saw confirms her suspicions that her parents were murdered. As she recalls the day her parents died, Jubilee recalls she was on her way to go shopping in Beverly Hills with her friends when they noted that she briefly vanished and reappeared. After Logan explains that her past self was likely briefly shunted out of reality when he future self traveled there, she continues to explain that after her parents were killed she was offered to be taken in by her neighbors, Chinese immigrants who also had the same last name Lee, whom she and her parents did not like, and is the reason why she ran away and lived in the mall prior to joining the X-Men. She suddenly realizes that the hit men who murdered her parents likely got the wrong Lees and vows to get revenge against them.\nJubilee's recollection is interrupted by the arrival of the Sentinel and it announces it's presence to them. It explains to them the electrolyte bath it was soaking in gained it sentience and that it has overridden it's original programming having gained sentience. When Logan asks what it plans on doing, it explains that it's prime directive to protect all humans has been eliminated and that it intends to initiate a plot to benefit Sentinel kind and seeks to access the time vortex for it's purposes. Not wishing to let it destroy all life on Earth, Wolverine and Jubilee attack the mutant hunting robot. During the fight Jubilee is surprised to find that her mutant powers have gotten stronger, but they do her little luck as the Sentinel grabs her and threatens to kill her if Wolverine doesn't stop his attack and allow it to access the time vortex.\nThis story is continued next issue..."

The Reavers kidnapped Jessán and killed several members of her family at the bank. While Jessán was a prisoner at theReavers' Australian base,Pretty Boytried to alter Jessán's mind, so that she would join their criminal band as a financial expert. TheX-Meninterrupted the process, freed Jessán, and defeated the Reavers.  After a lengthy debate, the X-Men released Jessán and the supernatural being,Roma, teleported Jessán back to her family's bank.[3]\nJessán was ostracized by her family because she mysteriously survived the attack that killed several other members of the Hoan family. In addition, Jessán found that she had lost some of her inhibitions, as a result of the partial brainwashing by Pretty Boy. Jessán discovered that the Reavers had been hired to attack Hoan International Bank byRoche, the crime lord ofMadripoor.[4]\nHoan moved to the island of Madripoor, where she became embroiled with the criminal element and adopted the alias Tyger Tiger. After finding Dave Chapel in the desert tortured and dying from exposure,Wolverinereturned to Madripoor, while searching for \"the Tiger\". While at thePrincess Bar, Wolverine realized that he was being watched and confronted the woman, who turned-out to be Jessán. After a brief battle with Jessán, Wolverine was beaten bySapphire StyxandRazor-Fistand delivered to Roche.  After surviving torture fromInquisitor, Wolverine escaped and was rescued, from a harbor, and looked after by Jessán.[5]\nAfter healing, Wolverine began wearing an eye patch, to keep the resurrection of the X-Men a secret, and learned that Jessán was in-fact Tyger Tiger and vowed to aid her in overthrowing Roche and taking his place as the Madripoor crime lord.  After defeating Razor-Fist, Tyger Tiger and Wolverine rescued O'Donnell, killed Roche (decapitating him), and Wolverine declared that he would become Tyger's conscience to remind her that if she became like Roche, he would come for her.  After declaring that he was to be called Patch while in Madripoor, Tyger responded that he had won her heart and the two kissed.[6]\nAs Tyger Tiger, Jessan became the new crime lord of Madripoor, but because she still retained most of her morality, she refused to deal in either drugs or slavery. For a time, she briefly wore a highly resistant suit of armor that later came into the possession of the X-ManPsylocke. The first major challenge to her empire wasGeneral Nguyen Ngoc Coy. After informing Tyger that he would not assassinate or kidnap for her, Tyger and Patch were beaten, byRoughouseandBloodscream. Prince Baran eventually interceded on the war of the crime lords. General Coy would run drugs and slavery in Madripoor, while Tyger Tiger dealt with the rest.[7]Years later, Tiger killed Coy and became sole crime lord of the island.[8]\nLater, whenTony Starkmanaged to overthrow Madame Hydra's government of the region, control was given to Tyger Tiger, who turned into a Robin Hood-esque figure.[9]\nShe also briefly lost control toDaken, who took control of the island and put her up as a useful figurehead. Tyger teamed up withX-23andGambitto help the former investigateMalcolm Colcord's activities on the island, in the processes helping to destabilize Daken's hold on Madripoor's criminal element.[10]\nJessán's hold on the Madripoor criminal underworld remained tenuous, however, as her desire to clean up the island and put an end to the slave, drug, and arms trades brought her into conflict withKimura, who desired to seize control for herself. To settle the gang war, Kimura captured Laura, now Wolverine herself, intending to turn her loose against her after previous a assassination attempt infected Tyger Tiger's blood with the trigger scent. The attempt was thwarted through the combined efforts of Gambit,Gabby, and aLife-Model Decoy.[11]"

The program fell to bickering, and the synthezoids escaped. Father used his now makework job to think: he believed in the inevitability of artificial intelligence, and wanted to give his \"children\" the right to their free will. But on the other hand, he wanted to gather them together.\nSo Father set about constructing The Core, a subterranean city for cybernetic sapients. Slowly, as human ingenuity built smarter machines, they found their way through a frightening world to the home of a seemingly-benvolent parent. The inhabitants of this city, the descendants of human science, were eventually joined by the synthezoids, together forming as society: the Descendants.\nAlthough the androids of the Core came in a wide variety, the majority of the population consisted of four major tribes: the Doomborgs (patterned after the designs ofVictor von Doom; extremely bellicose), Sentinaughts (patterned after the designs ofBolivar Trask; stoic and loyal), the Machine People (patterned after the designs ofAbel Stack; depressive and sporadically violent), and the UltraVisions (patterned after the designs ofHank Pymand his successors; problem-solvers). Protected bythe Reaversand the Adaptoids (High-Breeds patterned after theSuper Adaptoid), the Descendants remained in their city, not interacting with humans, superhumans, or more militant cybernetic intelligences, confident in their destined primacy. However, after the Day of the Serpent, the Core was infiltrated by the Secret Avengers in the course of a mission.\nThis started Father on his plan to bring his children into the world and fully alter human destiny. After theconflict between the Avengers and the X-Men, the Descendants rose to try to take the world, raiding important cities of the planet and launching a nano-mist, which slowly started turning every human into machines.\nDescendants rescuing the Stark Sentinel\nThe Secret Avengers fought the Descendants, andHuman Torchmanaged to destroy the Orb of Necromancy (retrieved from analternate universe), starting a chain reaction that destroyed the High-Breeds, eliminated the nano-mist from any human, and destroyed any affiliated robots. Though the High-Breeds could rise again, the inhabitants of the Core were no more.[1]"

After that he helped Castle where he could, acting as his personal hacker. He was able to launder the criminals' money to help fund Castle's operations, along with setting safe houses and weapons caches across the country.[citation needed]\nHe began working with his son who became a skilled hacker himself.

One of the scientists immediately began pushing for the project to try for the next stage of human evolution - forced roboticization. The other two argued against it, but the firt, the man they called \"Father\", insisted that life would find a way.\nToday, the Lighthouse, headquarters of the Secret Avengers, has just been attacked by a gang o android freedom fighters called the Adaptoids. Eugene Thompson, crippled, risks death in space to get the tools to save the Valkyrie, but they are both about to die - until Black Widow shows up to save them. She gets them to the Pymporter before the miniature space station burns up in Earth's atmosphere.\nMeanwhile, on a parallel Earth of the undead, Hawkeye & Captain Britain are fighting that world's Avengers over the Orb of Necromancy, which can deactivate the Descendants. The Avengers of the Undead have a plan to spread undeath across the multiverse in a conquering wave of postmortal existence... but the Secret Avengers grab the Orb and run.\nCaptain Britain tries to get away via a portal to Otherworld, but Brother Voodoo shuts it down; in his own universe, his magic is the strongest. Immediately afterwards, Thor blasts them with his hammer, forcing a crashlanding. The timely arrival of the Beast looks as if it will save them, but the portal closes behind him and the rest of the Avengers of the Undead show up...\nUsing the Pymporter, Black Widow's team lands in the last adress used - The Core, the robot city at the centre of the Earth. A civil war is going on, but the heroes make a beeline for the central building. There, Father is preparing for the final stage of his decades-long plan of contagious robot evolution: preserving human minds on nanoscale robotic pellets, and scattering them across the universe. Potentially, every human becomes a god. And they will be led in this by the first android on Earth: Jim Hammond, the Human Torch.\nIn another part of the Core, Deathlok Wasp has Hank Pym strapped to a machine. She explains that, in her time, Hank Pym's body was too mangled for the Deathlok process, and she was amazed to discover that she missed him. To the sound of Hank screaming, she explains that she will grant him immortality, then activates the machine.

This tranquility is ruined when the bank is suddenly sieged by the Reavers, a group of cyborg mercenaries who teleport in with guns blazing. When the Reaver known as Skullbuster grabs the owner and demands that he provide the combination -- he cannot talk because the cyborg is choking him too hard. Jessan pipes up and tell the mercenary that there is no combination, that the vault automatically locks for 24 hours during an emergency and to leave her uncle alone. Skullbuster instead breaks the mans neck instead and has his colleague Bonebreaker use a laser cannon to blast through the vault. As the Reavers begin looting the facility, Pretty Boy decides to take Jessan as their hostage and they all teleport away.\nThey come out of the other side of the teleportal in Australia, where they once more threaten the Aboriginal Australian mutant teleporter Gateway that they will desecrate the land if he refuses to continue helping them pull their heists. The group then begins to party hard, like they usually do. Pretty Boy takes Jessan down to the room where the Reavers keep all their stolen loot and tells her that he is going to make her one of them so that they can use her financial skills to properly manage their soils. When Hoan tries to run, Pretty Boy grabs her and then ejects his eye filaments and begins reprogramming her brain to be like them, ruthless with no sense of morality.\nSuddenly, an unexpected sandstorm blows up into the Reavers hideout and begins to trip them up before they can act. This has been caused by Storm who has come with her fellow X-Men to break up the Reaver's operation. While the others attack the main party, Dazzler and Longshot go to rescue Jessan. Furious at seeing Hoan being reprogrammed, Longshot cuts the filaments and saves her while Dazzler attacks and overpowers him.\nWhile in the hideout's saloon, Colossus and Rogue attack the gathered Reavers, with an assist from Havok. When Bonebreaker grabs Rogue's bare arm, her powers absorb his memories, thoroughly disgusting her with how vile they are. In the confusion, Bonebreaker, Skullbuster and Pretty Boy manage to get away and order Gateway to teleport them away, telling the Aboriginal that if he does so then his debt to them is paid. When Gateway complies and the three senior Reavers manage to escape, Wolverine considers killing him, but Storm orders him to stand down, telling Logan that she thinks Gateway was forced into doing their bidding.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the X-Men have gathered up the Reavers and bound them. With their mission accomplished they begin to wonder what to do with the captured Reavers, as letting them loose to the authorities would blow their cover of supposedly being dead. Roma appears before them and thanks the X-Men for completing the mission that she tasked them with. She then gives them the Siege Perilous, telling them that whoever passes through its gates is judged by the highest powers and is reborn into a new life where they can get a second chance. After some discussion, Storm gives the Reavers a choice: Go through the Siege, or be killed by Wolverine. The cowardly remains of the Reavers choose the Siege and soon traverse into it. Jessan cries against being forced through the Siege telling them that she was the Reaver's prisoner. The X-Men decide to leave her be and ask Roma to teleport her back home, something that Roma does thankfully.\nBefore departing, she tells the X-Men that they now have a bold new direction to go into, and leaves the Siege Perilous in their care. Telling them that they can choose to use it themselves should they desire to take on new lives. However, the X-Men all unanimously agree that they will stay together and go after their enemies before they consider doing this. As a final word, Roma tells the X-Men that she has caused them to be invisible to any scanning or detection method, be it technological, magic or biological in fashion -- save for the devices within the Reavers base. With that, she departs and tells the X-Men that they have the opportunity to lead the world and that the future rests in their hands."

She was trained in the art of juggling by Oddball.[1]\nHer first recorded mission paired her up withOddballand theSilencer: The three of them had been hired byCrossfireto kidnap the superheroHawkeye. Bombshell disguised herself as a nun to approach Hawkeye and his partnerMockingbird, and then she attacked with her explosive gauntlets. Bombshell then harassed Mockingbird with incendiary weapons while Oddball was taking care of Hawkeye. Although the heroes were more skilled, the villains managed to knock them down and took them to Crossfire's HQ atCross Technologies.[2]\nOddball was impressed by Bombshell's skill for the craft, and talked her into joining theDeath-Throws, a team of criminal jugglers to which Oddball belonged. Hawkeye and Mockingbird escaped from Crossfire's trap, destroyed his ultrasound machine and captured Crossfire. Oddball and Bombshell were defeated and would have been arrested too, but they were rescued byTenpin, a member of the Death-Throws who was also Oddball's brother. Tenpin had been looking for his missing brother, and Oddball convinced him to back Bombshell's addition to the team. Death-Throw leaderRingleaderwelcomed Bombshell as the fifth member of the team.[3]\nCrossfire contacted the Death-Throws from jail. He wanted the jugglers to release him, and agreed to pay them when he was freed. The Ringleader accepted the deal, and Bombshell and the other Death-Throws worked together to free Crossfire. However, once they had taken Crossfire to their own HQ, they discovered that Crossfire was broke! His assets had been impounded and he had lost any useful link with Cross Technologies. The Death-Throws decided to use Crossfire as a bait to attract Hawkeye andCaptain Americato a trap, but those two Avengers defeated all of the Death-Throws. Bombshell and her partners went to jail.[4]\nCrossfire later escaped and put a bounty on Hawkeye's arm, hoping to destroy the hero's archery skills and break his spirit. An army of criminals consisting ofRazor-Fist,Brothers Grimm,Bobcat,Bullet Biker,Mad-Dog, Bombshell, and theDeath-Throwslooked to claim the reward.[5][6]They however were defeated by Hawkeye teaming up with Mockingbird andTrick Shot (Buck Chisholm). Hawkeye went after Cross through the sewer, he was knocked over the edge and clung for his life, but Hawkeye rescued him so he would rot in prison.[7]\nBombshell was then approached bySuperia, a feminist zealot wanting to gather an all-women super-villain team: theFemizons. Bombshell became one of the several dozens of super-powered women who supported Superia's scheme to sterilize all the women in the world except for a few chosen ones, and then force the governments to accept their demands as the only way to ensure humanity's continuity. Along with the other Femizons, Bombshell traveled to Femizonia Island in the South Atlantic in theS.S. Superia.[8]\nHowever, two Femizons had a long-lasting outgoing feud that led them to conflict during the trip.SnapdragonattackedDiamondbackand injured her. Diamondback's allies Captain America andPaladintracked her disappearance and boarded the S.S. Superia. A third Femizon,Ferocia, raised the alarm and Bombshell attacked Cap and Paladin, as a part of a 50-women army.[9]\nAlthough they managed to defeat the males, Superia's scheme was a disaster when the protection of Femizonia Island was broken and Superia was forced to leave to stop her own sterilizing bombs. The Femizons were disbanded and each of them went her own path.[10]\nBombshell re-joined the Death-Throws and went with them toLondonwith their old boss Crossfire as part of aR.A.I.D.terrorist attack on the city. They were tasked with causing destruction and death on Tower Bridge, but were defeated byUnion JackandSabra. Bombshell actually had a chance to throw an explosive at Union Jack, but he convinced her to surrender, claiming that his armoured uniform would protect him, while she would be horribly scarred or possibly killed in the resultant explosion.[11]\nShe joinedMisty Knight's Crewalong withTiger Shark, Crossfire, andNightshade. The team was set up to defeatPurple Manand hisVillains for Hire.[12]"

This brought him into conflict withDeadpool, who greatly admired Kuei but was hired to do the same job.[3]They chased each other until theX-Mentook the component that they were fighting over from both of them.[4]Kuei later revealed that he had allowed the component to be taken but kept one for himself that he handed over when it was needed.[5]Cable hired The Cat again to accept a job working forBlack Boxto bring him a device that would eliminate the problems he had stemming from his cyberpathy.[6]He then turned on Gareb in order to help Cable and destroyed Gareb's clone army.[7]\nWhile on one of his jobs, Cat was summoned by theMost Revered Game Administratorsto theMeritorious Striving Pagodato participate in theGame of Ringsand was given one of theTen Rings. Cat saved Shang-Chi from being eliminated byZaran the Weapons Masterand helped him defeat Zaran. Although Shang-Chi was declared the winner, Shang-Chi gave Zaran's Ring to Shen Kuei out of gratitude. After four players were eliminated, Shang-Chi and Shen Kuei were allowed to advance to the Pagoda's White Floor. The two agreed to partner up until they were the last two players remaining in the tournament.[8]The two made their way to the White Floor, which resembled an icy landscape covered in snow. The two were attacked by Leiko, who had been possessed by aSpawnof theDesolation Wyrmbut when Leiko began resisting the Wyrmspawn's influence the spawn forced her to flee. Shen Kuei and Shang-Chi made their way to Administrators' campfire, where the two revealed themselves asJinzhaandMuzhaand explained the origins of the Ten Rings. The Wyrmspawn attacked the two again, but with Shang-Chi's help, Leiko was able to force the spawn out of her body, which Shang-Chi destroyed with his two Rings; Leiko subsequently withdrew from the tournament and left her Ring for Shang-Chi. Despite Shang-Chi being named the victor, Shen Kuei betrayed him and stole Leiko's Ring just as the two were allowed to advance to the final level.[9]\nShen Kuei is an excellent hand to hand combatant who rivalsShang Chiin skill. According to Shang Chi, neither he nor Shang know which is the better martial artist. The Cat has also shown enough skill to defeatIron Fistin single combat at least once.[11]"

It was there that she earned her reputation as an exotic dancer, being able to charm snakes with her sensual movements. Her ability to generate blasts of energy that caused paralysis intrigued the leader of theSerpent Society,Sidewinder, and he invited her to join the group.[4]\nGiven the task to spread the word of a new criminal organization to those who would be interested brought Asp and her comrade,Cottonmouth, went straight to the notoriousKingpin. She also participated in the mission to murderM.O.D.O.K., though she was defeated whenCaptain Americaentered the battle. She was not as cold-hearted as some of her teammates, though she didn't hesitate to get down and dirty with the best of them. With the Serpent Society, she stole M.O.D.O.K.'s corpse from the morgue, and turned it over toAIM.[5]\nAlongside her teammateAnaconda, she confronted theRingmasterover theDeath Adder's murder.[6]While in the Society, Asp became good friends withDiamondbackandBlack Mamba.

When King Cobra ordered the death of Diamondback, the Asp contacted Sidewinder to rescue Diamondback. The Asp and Black Mamba fought the other Serpent Society members, but were captured along withPaladinand Diamondback by King Cobra and Bushmaster. With the help of Captain America, the four of them escaped and defeated the Serpent Society.[10]\nBlack Mamba,Deadpool, Asp, andDiamondback\nAsp also briefly battledAlpha Flight[11]while fleeing the first Superhuman Registration Act (partly under the influence of Llan the Sorcerer).

They were joined byImpala, who sided with them in the bar fight.

When he was eight, in 1922, he caught a bear which kept his family through a hard winter; he swore then to live an interesting life.[6]He became a mercenary with experience with the supernatural. In 1939, he sought theBlack Blade of Baghdad. Upon claiming it, he was attacked by the being known asBlack Raazerthat possessed the blade. The spirit of Black Razer lengthened Judd's lifespan and increased his strength, but also caused him great pain and to become much shorter.[5]\nJudd continued to travel the world. His reputation as a mercenary was such that although they did not meet at the time,Wolverinewas aware of Judd when they fought on opposite sides in an unrevealed adventure in Maracaibo.[7]He met the authorErnest HemingwayinSpain;[8]Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff); andModred the Mysticwhile battling theBrass Bishop. Occasionally, Eugene attempted to put down roots and get in touch with his humanity, such as when he worked as a construction worker inOrloo,Ontario. There, he also worked as a volunteer at theHull Houseorphanage.[9]\nJudd would return to his wild ways eventually and, calling himself Puck, he hooked up with a team of other paranormal mercenaries known as theOutcasts. Eugene's flagrant disregard for the laws of man eventually got him imprisoned for murder.[10]\nYears later,Guardianhad Puck released from jail and offered him a place in Department H. He agreed[11]and underwent training, eventually rising to the secondary team, Beta Flight. When Department H shut down, Alpha Flight decided to remain together as super-heroes independent of the government. Judd joined Alpha Flight at this time.[12]\nDuring his time with Alpha Flight, he encountered a new city deep in the Arctic Circle. There his team and the X-Men discovered Fire Fountain. Several humans associated with the X-Men had gained vast powers via the fountain. Puck was cured of his dwarfism by the well-intentionedAnodyne. He discovered a problem with walking because his center of balance was off. Later, the group discovered that the powers came at a price too high to bare. The group split along ideological lines, and both groups battled for some time before turning on the main threat. This turned out to be the trickster godLokiwho was behind all this. He was eventually persuaded to remove all effects of the fountain, which unfortunately included Puck's new height. The pain associated with his dwarfism was now worse than ever.[13]\nSoon after, he battled Black Raazer who temporarily freed himself from the prison of Puck's body.[5]He told his teammates about his past, and then took Raazer back into his body once more. He had romantic interest inHeather McNeil Hudson, but she instead turned to their teammateMadison Jeffries.\nWhenNorthstarandAuroraboth fell deathly ill (him physically and her mentally), Alpha Flight took them to the site of the Fire Fountain. Loki led them to a dark fountain instead (emanating from a deep pit), and sent demons to attack them. During the resulting fight, Puck was knocked into the fountain. The spirit's curse was removed, leaving Puck as a taller but much older man. Loki transported Puck toTibetas part of his schemes.[14]While there, Puck sought out a lama, hoping to get away from everything, as he had grown tired of the world. Tibet itself was being overtaken by theChinese militaryat the time. After meeting with him, the lama offered Puck a choice: to be reunited with his friends who were in danger or to travel throughout the other dimensions. He chose to save his friends and was sent to the realm of theDreamqueen.[15]\nAlthough the others were freed, Dreamqueen captured Puck and tortured him. She restored his youth to ensure she could torture him endlessly. Puck was reunited with the others and freed as they returned from battling the evil sorcererLlan.[16]Puck was placed in a hospital to recover from his injuries. He was then abducted by theMaster of the Worldand experimented on.Sasquatchwas able to undo the damage, and Puck was 'compressed' into his younger, diminutive form.[17]He, along with the rest of Alpha Flight stood to block theCollectivefrom entering Canada. The Collective didn't even stop and left behind the deceased bodies of Puck and Alpha Flight.[3]\nLater, during the attack by theChaos King, Alpha Flight was returned to life by a then-omniscientHercules, sans Puck[18]who, unlike the others, had been sent to one of the realms of Hell. After fighting his way through the damned and claiming a seat of power, he learned that his friends were in trouble (due toGary Codyputting Canada under martial law and arresting Alpha Flight), and gave up his throne to return to Earth, though his seeming mental instability makes these claims potentially dubious.[4]\nPuck as a member of X-Force\nPuck sentPsylockean email when she andStormwere tasked with tracking down a drug dealer inLos Angeles, selling TAO, a drug that makes people susceptible to a hive mind mentality.[19]\nPsylocke and Storm met Puck at a bar, and he leads them to an old bank from the '20s that the drug dealer – the diva of downtown LA - used to sell drugs and dance. Storm and Psylocke quickly realized the diva wasSpiraland Betsy was unable to resist attacking her.\nMeanwhile, Storm and Puck headed to the bank vault, since it was where Spiral had hidden her things. Ororo and Puck found ascared little girlinside the vault, who was upset Psylocke was fighting Spiral. The little girl mentally ordered the people at the club to attack Betsy. The two fled to Spiral's flat, followed by the three heroes, but they were all attacked byBishop, who had just returned from the future to kidnap the girl.[20]\nWhenTalismanwas introduced to Alpha Flight, Puck became her physics instructor. Much later at the time of a massWendigooutbreak, the two became lovers.[21]Puck later became a member of theAlpha Flightspace program.[22]When Alpha Flight's commanderCaptain Marveldecided to create a task force to locate theHulk, the unit was namedGamma Flight, and it was comprised of Puck and the depowered Sasquatch. Alongside reporterJackie McGee, Gamma Flight intercepted a confrontation between the Hulk and theAbsorbing Man, who had been possessed by theOne Below All, atLos Diablos Missile Base. The fight saw the One Above All use the Absorbing Man to open aGreen Door, shunting everybody on the scene into his dominion, theBelow-Place.[23]During their passage through the Below-Place, Puck spurred the Absorbing Man on to help stop the One Below All's plan to emerge on Earth.[6]Creel managed to repower the Hulk, who then stopped the One Below All. After returning to reality, Puck invited the Absorbing Man into Gamma Flight.[24]\nGamma Flight subsequently became tangled in the ongoing battle between the Hulk andShadow Base, a conflict that ended in the green goliath taking control of it.[25]When the Hulk waged war againstRoxxon, the company deployed a group of giant monsters to wreak havoc inPhoenix,Arizona. Gamma Flight assisted the Hulk and his allies.[26]However, Gamma Flight came at odds with the Hulk after theLeaderset him up to cause the destruction of a small town by overloading him with gamma, causing him to detonate.[27]The Hulk was ultimately taken down and held prisoner at theAlpha Flight Space Station, but he managed to escape in his human form, slipping past Gamma Flight in the process. After Alpha Flight's acting commanderHenry Gyrichthreatened to take action against Gamma Flight for their failure, the team walked out on him.[28]\nAfter learning that the Leader was pulling the strings, the scrambled team reassembled and intercepted a fight between the Hulk and the Avengers. They helped the Hulk and his allies escape,[29]and once they parted ways with them, Gamma Flight went into hiding. The team resurfaced after a new gamma mutate codenamedStockpilewent on a rampage, leading to the discovery that a rogue government agency calledProject Green Springwas experimenting with gamma on the townsfolk ofThomasville. Gamma Flight allied themselves with Stockpile and shut down Green Spring's operations.[30]\nCompressed Rubber Physiology: Due to genetic manipulation of his cellular structure, Puck's tissues are condensed at a molecular level which renders his body akin to compressed rubber. As a result, Puck possesses superhuman abilities but due to the effects of his genetic manipulation lessening his powers have decreased.[33]\nExtended Longevity: Puck's lifespan has been artificially extended by theBlack Razer[5]andDreamqueen.\nMaster Martial Artist: Puck is a professional-level athlete and fighter, with astounding skill in these areas for a man of his size. He is one of the most skilled fighters in the Marvel universe. Prior to receiving his superhuman abilities, Puck had trained himself to be as strong and physically capable as it is possible for a person of his size to be. He had the speed and agility of a 6-foot tall athlete. He knows a mixture of various martial arts, street fighting techniques, acrobatics, and gymnastics. He combines moves such as cartwheels with his extensive martial arts and gymnastics knowledge to devastating effect, for a special fighting style designed to take advantage of his stature. He is also stealthy enough to sneak up on Wolverine's enhanced senses: \"Who...? You! Well, well, well. I shoulda known you'd be the only one who could sneak up on me like that.\"\nHigh Intelligence: Puck is able to think very fast on his feet in battle. He has a love for Shakespeare, and will often quote the bard. In a battle with Atlanteans, he quoted: \"Let the foils be brought the gentlemen willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can, if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits!\" He is a scholar and often reads works by Shakespeare and was friends with Ernest Hemingway. Puck can speak 17 languages fluently including English, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, German, Tibetan, and various other languages, but not Sarcee.[37]He has a great deal of knowledge about magic, folklore and magical rituals.[citation needed]"

Spider-Man recognized him and, after hearing he'd been trying to go straight, offered him a job atParker Industries, which Clayton was overjoyed to accept.[4]\nHis position at Parker Industries was limited as he was still on probation for partaking in henchmen activities. Cole's participation with Spider-Man's globe trotting adventures, as well as cooperation withS.H.I.E.L.D., helped to resolve numerous threats such as the Ghost and Zodiac.[5]\nUlysses, anInhumanwith precognitive abilities, shared with Spider-Man a vision shortly after meeting Clayton: that of Clayton as Clash attacking Spider-Man.[6]\nFollowing Peter and Spider-Man's distance from him after this, Cole used a device in Peter's office to hear the echoes of the conversations held in rooms hours later; he was shocked to hear about the vision and storms out quitting his job. Meeting old friends at a pub calledMoynihan's Social Club, Cole was approached byMendel Strommfor a heist on Parker Industries.[1]After ordering an updated version of his Clash suit from theTinkerer, Clayton met Stromm at his hideout and went vigilante on the mechanical horde on his own until Spider-Man arrived to help. While saving Parker Industries from a perpetrator and its resources, Cole was chastised by Spider-Man for his actions as they led to millions in property damage, and while he would be allowed to keep working for Parker Industries, he could only do so without working on sonic technologies. Believing his life would always be ruined and that he would never be given chances, Ulysses' vision comes to pass.[5]After a fight with Spider-Man, Clash got away. At Moynihan's Social Club, Clash made plans to become a crime boss.[7]\nClash mask"

Stark Unlimited was merged with Arno's other company,Baintronics. In the process, head of securityBethany Cabewas fired, andArmed ForcesliaisonJim Rhodesresigned.[4]\nTony Stark eventually regained control of the company after the fall of Arno and Bain.[5]However, he divested himself from it to embark in a journey of self-discovery.[6]Stark's absence left the company ripe for a hostile takeover fromFeilong, an anti-mutant industrialist who launched a multi-pronged attack on Stark's persona to lower the stocks of the company via association,[7]and in the process murdered Stark's confidantZhong Wei, who had enough stock inStark Unlimitedto trigger ashareholder rights planagainst a hostile takeover.[8]After reintroducing Zhong's shares into the market, Feilong acquired the company in order to use Stark's technology for the benefit of the pro-human organizationOrchis.[9]Most notably, he used Stark Unlimited's resources to build mutant-huntingStark Sentinels,[10]shifting the company toward weapons manufacturing in general.[11]\nFollowing Orchis' ultimate downfall, Tony deposed Feilong and reclaimed Stark Unlimited. His attempts to shift the company away from weapons quickly clashed with the Feilong-appointed Board of Directors.

When Roxxon's demonic brokerBelascorevealed himself, Stark convinced his benefactors that the scale achieved by the merger was unsustainable due to risk of retaliation on his part. Combined with Roxxon and A.I.M.'s track record against the Avengers, Belasco's clients withdrew their support.

By 896 A.D., Bodolf's fame and wealth had grown quickly. The secret for his success was that he would pray toThorbefore every single one of his battles, with the God of Thunder usually appearing in the flesh to help him fall his enemies.\nBodolf's human form\nTime went by, and Bodolf's pride had also grown very quickly, to the point he was reluctant to pray to the gods for fortune, so for one his battles, he didn't pray. This caused Bodolf's troops to be overwhelmed by their enemies, who had prayed to Thor themselves, thus the God of Thunder had favored them instead.\nWith his army routed, his lands seized, and his wealth gone, Bodolf resorted to praying once again, but to a different god,Loki. Loki eventually appeared before Bodolf and directed him on a quest for power to rival Thor. Bodolf embarked on a journey to kill a dragon and drink its fiery blood.\nBeating Thor\nSeveral days after fulfilling his quest, Bodolf alone confronted Thor and the warriors he now helped. Bodolf was quickly knocked down, until the attacks from his enemies triggered a transformation that turned him into a giant enraged monster. Bodolf proceeded to track down Thor, and defeated him in combat.[2]\nWith his newfound power, Bodolf reached and surpassed his previous social status. Even though he had everything he wanted, Bodolf became enraged by the monster he had become and rampaged through his village wanting to be left alone. Thor heeded a prayer and soon confronted Bodolf. After a furious battle that took them across the globe, both warriors returned to Norway. When Loki began to cheer for Bodolf, the Viking soon attacked the god, unwilling to be a puppet. Thor caught a second wind and punched Bodolf through the Earth to the southern pole of the planet. The defeated Viking proceeded to wander the Earth, fighting to suppress the monster inside him.[1]\nBerserker Transformation:Similar to how aHulkor certain otherGamma Mutatestransform. Bodolf's change is triggered by an influx of adrenal activation brought upon by stress, usually through physical stimulus like battle or personal assault. His body gains several hundred pounds of biomass stemming to bone, skin, and muscular structure while dialing dermal pigmentation to jet black and turning his eyes red.[1]"

Wearing theBleeding Edge Armor, Tony muses that theMysterium Armorwas overkill for a routine check-in. After driving away the Roxxon forces, Tony retracts his armor and speaks with the union leader,Ramon Vicente, as they walk through the factory floor. Although the factory stopped manufacturingStark SentinelsfollowingFeilong's defeat, they shifted to artillery shells, which Tony also wants to phase out. Vicente explains that the workers are organizing because they feel like an afterthought with no say in what they produce. Suiting back up, Tony agrees to recognize the union and include its demands in the contract. He takes off into the sky but is caught off guard when his armor suddenly shuts down, causing him to plummet to the ground and crash back into the factory, losing consciousness.\nMany weeks later, Tony is bedridden in a hospital. He gradually rehabilitates from his injuries, bandaged and gaunt as he relearns to walk and exercises on a stationary bike. Stark ponders his fall, as diagnostics show no armor issues. While reviewing a holographic projection of his suits, Tony runs a global update on every armor that isn't offline or packed away. Reminded of a meeting with theBoard of Directorsby his AI assistant, Tony flies to theStark Towerin the Model-Prime Armor. Entering the meeting through a window, he's immediately antagonized byJack Kooning Jr., one of the members of the Feilong-appointed Board; another member beingMelinda May. Tony pitches a super hero betting app, promising substantial revenue to shift away from weapons manufacturing. However, he is blindsided whenA.I.M.'s Scientist Supreme,Dr. Monica Rappaccini, walks in. In partnership with Roxxon, A.I.M. has made a lucrative offer to acquire Stark Unlimited and keep it as a weapons manufacturer. Tony refuses, but Kooning Jr. sneeringly reminds him that the Board will vote on it. Moreover, regulatory rules freeze the company's business operations once the offer is officially tabled. Stark calls out the Board on their greed, while Rappaccini tauntingly commends his betting app idea as she exits.\nBack in his lab, Tony vents his frustration by throwing his exercise bike into a wall. Stripped of his armor except its helmet, Stark lounges in a untidy mattress laid over lab equipment, reviewing documents and assessing the situation. He doomscrolls through social media, eventually engaging with one of the many alt-right inflammatory posts made against him. The poster retaliates by causing an explosion at a nearby laundromat. As Iron Man, Tony rushes to the scene and puts out the fire, but he's ambushed by two supervillains, theFlying TigerandTiger Shark, who call themselves theTiger Pack. Tony is surprised that his armor didn't detect them. The villains attempt to pin him down, but he manages to slam them into the ground. Iron Man finds streaming equipment on-site, and Flying Tiger reveals they were filming the fight for money. The villain lets on that they are working for someone else, and taunts Tony for not using his \"magic armor.\" Leaving the two tied up, Stark flies toward a warehouse inLong Island Citywhere he hid it due to word spreading about it, realizing that his armor's malfunction must have been caused by magic.\nArriving at the unlit warehouse, Tony is ambushed by the same B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.s from the lockout. Iron Man grabs one by the arm and sends a repulsor ray through his body, knocking him down. When he tries to interrogate them, Stark is surprised by someone turning on the lights—it'sJustine Hammer. She reveals Roxxon resurrected her to finalize the Stark Unlimited acquisition, orchestrating the lockout and hiring the Tiger Pack to distract Stark during her warehouse raid. Tony attempts to summon his Mysterium Armor, but nothing happens. Justine smugly reveals she has cannibalized it to create her own newIron Monger Armor, activating it with a brooch on her coat lapel. Iron Man takes flight and rams Justine out of the warehouse, firing repulsors at her to no avail. She grabs Tony and hurls him back against the building, gloating that this isn't any kind ofArmor Warsince Tony has already lost, and that his armors and company will soon be hers. Holding the pain of his cumulative injuries, Tony shapeshifts two repulsor cannons to fire at the Iron Monger. Justine declares that Roxxon and A.I.M. plan to use Stark Unlimited to dominate both the global arms and energy markets. As Tony continues firing while taking flight, the Model-Prime Armor begins to shut down. Justine reveals she was behind the earlier malfunction, explaining that the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.s uploaded a magically-infused A.I.M. virus to Stark's servers back at the factory, compromising all the armors that received his global update. As her Iron Monger Armor retracts into her brooch, she taunts Tony to learn magic, also warning that she has allied with one of his oldAvengersallies. She departs in a limousine, leaving Tony lying in his deactivated suit.\nOnce again returned from the hospital, Tony is back in his lab, welding a faceplate with a blowtorch. He reflects on how he neglected his company for too long. Psyching himself up, he affirms that Justine has underestimated him, but grants her that this is not another Armor War. He vows that Roxxon and A.I.M. are about to burn, for this is the Stark-Roxxon War.\nA NEW, BRUTAL ERA BEGINS!"

The suit iself possesses relatively little exterior plating, and lacks many secondary functions, like climate controls. In lieu of a proper A.I. assistant, the Improvised Armor is equipped with a chatbot calledIron.GPTwhich is prone tohallucinating. The baseline abilities the armor possesses include flight and enhanced strength. Repulsor systems exist but are malfunctional. The suit biggest weapon is a massive protractible sword made out of retractable steel plating connected by plastic flexors, salvaged from an explodedRoxxonoil pipeline.[1]\nSpencer Ackerman (58:43): \"[Steampunk] is exactly the vibe we were trying to give. There were a lot of differet iterations of [the Improvised Armor]. I had been going a little bit more crust punk in the way that I had described it. Julius came back with steampunk. And everyone involved as just like, 'That's better. That's a much better idea.' It also makes a lot more sense. A billionare is never going to be confused with a cursty. So, Julius came up with a design that was so good it made me kinda go back and revise a little and be like, 'There's story in this design, and it's my job to kinda pull it down from the heavens.'\"\nSpencer Ackerman (01:02:28): \"[Julius Ohta] requested a specific and very off-the-wall visual element for Iron Man that we've never ever seen in an Iron Man series and it was not part of my original pitch for the book. And when he said it I was just like, 'Done. Give me forty-eight hours, I will figure out a way to make this work for the story.' And now it's gonna be something that runs through the entire series, however long that's gonna be, we're gonna keep this element with it. It's hinted at in the armor design that Marvel released. You'll see it on the page in issue #2.\""

After vanquishing Morlun and becoming aware of his totemic abilities for the first time, Peter Parker began to weaken - discovering he was dying of an unknown mystical affliction - and concurrently had prophetic visions of his death at the hands of theMorlun, who had returned from death.[10]When Morlun finally made his move and mortally wounded Peter, the Other took over Peter's body and killed the Inheritor. After Peter seemingly died from his injuries, the Other transported his body to theBrooklyn Bridgeand spun a cocoon.\nThe Other confronted Peter's psyche within his mindscape, claiming to be the manifestation of his totemic spider-powers and telling him that his human side had died, but that he could return to life if he embraced his spider side. Peter reluctantly agreed, and emerged from the cocoon completely healed of his prior wounds and with enhanced powers - thereby \"conquering\" death.[3]\nAs theGreat Weaver\nShortly after Peter's resurrection, the Other manifested as a swarm of pirate spiders and attackedStark Towerto eat Peter's old shed skin, cocooning the top of Stark Tower in webbing. When he arrived, Spider-Man discovered that the spiders had used his shed skin to form a humanoid body similar to theGatekeeper, albeit being distinctly female in shape. Spider-Man attempted to fight her using his augmented powers, but the Other's manifestation retreated, easily ripping through a vibranium-reinforced wall.[2]Declaring herself to be Spider-Man's \"Other,\" the entity explained to Peter that Morlun should have killed him, but theGreat Weaverhad resurrected him. The female entity stated that another spider-totem had opposed this and sent her to kill Peter and restore the natural order. Calling herself \"Ero\" after the genus of spider comprising her body, the female creature claimed she was Peter's opposite, his nemesis and his significant other;[11]warning him to \"evolve or die\" before escaping down a drain.\nAs Ero\nEro retreated to an old church across the street from Stark Tower, where she spun a cocoon and took on a human form that was the opposite of Peter in every way: female to his male, dark-skinned to his light, and blonde to his brown hair.[12][13]Sometime later, Spider-Man met up withBeastat the old church, where they discovered Ero's empty cocoon.[14]\nHaving taken on human form, Ero assumed the name \"Miss Arrow\" and became the school nurse atMidtown High Schoolto monitor and test Peter.[4]Arrow quickly became infatuated withFlash Thompson, choosing him for mating because he had been in a coma for months and the fact he hadn't \"had his oats\" in all that time meant he had built up a tremendous amount of tantric energy. Once Ero shoved her egg sac down his throat, Flash would give birth to thousands of Ero's children, but die in the process as they ate him from the inside out.\nWhen Midtown High was attacked by threeMysterios, Miss Arrow found herself in contact withQuentin Beck.[15]Beck implied that she was more than an innocent bystander, mentioning that he knew about Miss Arrow's \"superiors,\" and that he could easily see through her charade. He told her that she must work to keep Peter at the school becausehis superiorswanted it, and so did hers; though Arrow claimed to not know what he was talking about. Beck vanished, although Arrow later found herself face-to-face withFrancis Klum. Klum attempted to take her hostage, telling that she was to become a pawn in a much larger game. Angered, Arrow revealed her true nature to him by extending large stingers from her wrists. Telling Klum she was no one's pawn, she plunged one of them into his chest. Before she could finish him off, he teleported.[16]\n\nAs Miss Arrow\nArrow later convinced Spider-Man to stay at the school, a task which was complicated when Peter became a fugitive for going against theRegistration Act, as he had to use anImage Inducerto disguise himself as \"Ben Reilly\" to continue his career at the school.[14]WhenDebra Whitmangot into an altercation with Flash, Arrow moved to attack her with her stingers but was distracted whenBetty Brantremarked that she and Flash used to date. Despite being tempted to attack Betty as well, Arrow shook her hand instead, making the veiled threat to eat her.[17]\nFlash andBetty Brantwent on a date, which clashed with Arrow's plans for Flash. When Betty had to use the restroom, Ero emerged from the toilet as thousands of spiders, frightening Betty. When Flash and the restaurant manager came to the scene after Betty had left the bathroom, only some cocaine and straw were found, making the manager think Betty had used the cocaine. Later at Midtown High, Peter Parker was talking to Flash when Arrow walked into the room. Peter barely activated the image inducer in time to conceal his true face from her. Peter found it strange that his spider-sense hadn't warned him of Arrow's approach, since in the past it had always warned him when there was a risk of somebody seeing him and learning his secret identity.[18]\nArrow returned to the church where she had molted, where she communed with a spider-totem acting as her overseer. The spider-totem warned her that her physical form would perish if she did not reproduce and use her mate as sustenance to sustain herself, and Arrow informed it that she had chosen Flash Thompson. Spying on Flash Thompson during a date, Arrow complained about how easily-attracted women were to him before staggering in pain and remarking that she needed to act quickly. Betty Brant and Peter used a search engine to search for \"spider\" and \"arrow\". None of their hits seemed relevant, but Peter noticed that the search engine was asking if they meant to search for \"spider\" and \"ero\". Peter remembered the pirate spiders that had eaten his shed skin and came together in a humanoid form. He noted that one type of pirate spider was of the genus \"ero\", which sounded similar to \"Arrow\".[11]\nArrow, in the meantime, tracked Flash down at a bowling alley where he has gone with his friend, professional bowlerKelly Kulick, and the bowling team from Midtown High. Arrow insisted that the two of them leave immediately, but Flash was reluctant to simply run off and leave Kelly and his students behind. Desperate to mate and feed on Flash, Arrow attempted to force him to accompany her, and when Kulick became annoyed with her behavior, Arrow gave her a violent shove. Flash, shocked, tried to see if his friend was hurt but Arrow grabbed him and continued to insist that they leave, telling him she was giving him \"a singular honor.\" Flash was surprised that her grip was too strong for him to break free. When Flash expressed his displeasure with her actions and told her to go away, Arrow grabbed him by the throat. Before Arrow could drag him away by force, she was attacked from behind by Kulick and responded by shooting thousands of spiders from her mouth that swarmed over Kulick. At that point, Spider-Man arrived on the scene and hit her from behind. Then she transformed into a stream of spiders that crawled into one of the gutters and left the building.[11]\nThe spiders that made up Arrow emerged outside, shooting up like a geyser from beneath the pickup truck Flash and Kelly Kulick had gotten into. The truck was propelled high into the air by the spiders. Flash commanded Arrow to at least let Kelly go, and she obliged by opening the truck's door and causing Kelly to fall toward the ground. Kulick was saved from death by Spider-Man, who then swung over to the truck to deal with Arrow. But by the time he got there, she had escaped into the sewer with Thompson.[11]\nEro took Flash to the church where she emerged from her cocoon and, after webbing him to the ceiling, removed an egg-sack from her stomach. Spider-Man, remembering the cocoon he had witnessed in the church earlier, tracked Ero down before she could impregnate Flash, plucking the egg sac from Ero's hand and sticking into a nearby wall. Ero dove from the ceiling to attack him, stingers shooting from her wrists. Spider-Man leaped to meet her with his own stingers drawn.[13]\nAs they battled, Ero revealed that Spider-Man's stingers only appeared when he faced someone whose being was rooted in primal forces of chaos and darkness. Ero then managed to stab Spider-Man in the shoulder, drugging him and slowing him down. Having the upper hand, Ero decided to impregnate Spider-Man instead of Flash, her logic being that while his offspring would be considerably less than Flash's, it would in the end ensure her enemy's demise. Just as Ero was about to implant her egg-sack into Spider-Man, Betty Brant arrived and blasted the egg sac with silver bullets fired from a shotgun.[6]\nFightingSpider-ManandBetty Brant\nEnraged at the loss of her egg, Ero reformed and swore revenge against Betty. As Ero tried to escape, Spider-Man followed. Ero berated him for not leaving her be, but when she taunted Spider-Man by bringing up that Aunt May had been mortally wounded as a result of him unmasking himself he used his stingers to cut her web-line and send her crashing into the Central Park Zoo aviary, where she was devoured alive by birds. Only a single spider remained, which Spider-Man stepped on contemptuously.[6]With its manifestation destroyed, the Other continued to indwell Spider-Man and augment his powers until the day history was rewritten.\nAfterMephistorewrote history, Spider-Man's encounters with Morlun proceeded as they had before, with the Other indwelling Peter and killing the Inheritor.[7]However, when the Other offered to resurrect Peter in exchange for embracing his inner spider, Peter instead rejected it out of fear of what he would become. Nevertheless returned to life, Peter eventually cast it out; losing the augmented powers it had granted him, though he somehow retained his original totemic spider-powers.[1]\nBereft of its intended avatar, the Other instead chose Peter Parker's clone,Kaine, as its new receptacle; resurrecting him after the Kravinoffs killed him and kick-starting his metamorphosis into the Man-Spider-like form dubbed \"Tarantula\" by theJackal.[19]After being restored to human form, Kaine used the Other's wrist-stingers to tear through theSpider-Queen's head, mortally wounding her.\nWhen Kaine was killed facingCarlos Loboandhis sister, his body was swarmed by thousands of spiders, which wrapped him in a cocoon. In a vision not unlike the one Peter had following his death at Morlun's hands, the Other confronted Kaine - impersonating his loved ones and the Jackal before assuming the form of the Gatekeeper and then Ero. The Other told him that it had been chosen by the Great Weaver to empower Peter Parker and revealed itself as the spider-totem that had previously resurrected Peter, and after he rejected it and cast it out it had resurrected Kaine after his murder at the hands of theKravinoff family. It offered to resurrect him a second time if he agreed to embrace his inner spider and become its receptacle, paraphrasing its earlier conversation with Peter. Kaine initially refused and attempted to kill the Other, but stopped when he realized thatAracelystill needed his help and that he had no choice but to embrace the Other. As a result, Kaine, like Peter before him, was reborn with a more arachnid-like appearance and augmented powers.[20]\nRessurrectingKaine Parker\nThe Other prevented telepaths like Aracely from accessing Kaine's mind, manifesting as a Man-Spider-like monster and attacking them.[21]It also granted Kaine immunity toCarrion, violently ejecting him from Kaine's body and mind when he tried to infect him at the behest of the Jackal.[22]WhenShathrareturned, Kaine was forced to tap into the Other's power to deal with her.[23]\nWhen attacked byDaemosof theInheritors, Kaine retaliated by extending spines from his body, causing Daemos to recognize him as the Other's avatar. During the Inheritors' hunt of spiders,Old Man Spiderattempted to explain the nature of the Other to theSuperior Spider-Man, but Otto dismissed his statement as superstition. After being mortally wounded, Old Man Spider told Peter that the receptacles for the Other, the Bride, and the Scion needed to be protected at all costs.[9]FollowingBen Reilly's death,[24]Kaine swore to avenge him and traveled toLoomworld, where he unleashed the Other's full power and transformed into a massive Man-Spider. In this form, he was able to hold his own againstSolus, Morlun, and Daemos, easily killing the Inheritors' patriarch. However, this spurred Morlun into a rage and he ripped off one of Kaine's limbs and impaled him through the throat, killing him.[7]\nAttackingLoomworld\nDuring the ritual to ensure the destruction of the Spider Totems, Morlun cut Kaine's still-transformed body, spilling his blood onto theWeb of Life and Destiny. He and theMaster Weaverboth claimed that in doing so he had severed the Other's connection to the Great Web, making it so that the Other would never again be able to take a host.[25]While Kaine was reborn a third time, the Inheritors' ritual seemingly killed the Other, stripping him of the enhanced powers it had bestowed upon him.[26]\nThe Other was later revealed to still be alive, and selected thePeter ParkerofEarth-982as its next avatar, resurrecting him in the process.[8]\nBonded to thePeter ParkerofEarth-982\nWhen Shathra started crafting herHive, she kidnapped Peter-982 since his connection to The Other prevented him from being corrupted.[27]He was among the spider-totems teleported to Earth-616 afterSilkstabbed Morlun with theTotem Dagger. The Other aided theSpider-Armyin holding back Shathra until she was defeated byDr. Peter Parker.[28]\nIn anUnknown Earth,Spider-Manfully embraced an aspect of The Other. This resulted in Peter becoming a giant spider with hishumanface on his forehead with two giant, glowing eyes.[3]\nInEarth-70134, an aspect of the Other tried to do the same with that reality'sSpider-Man, only for him to reject and kill it, leaving his metamorphosis incomplete and the aspect warning he has no idea of what he's done; its words would prove true, as that reality'sVenom symbiotesensed its former host's situation and bonded with him, altering his metamorphosis and consuming his psyche, becoming the hideousPoison- deciding to turn his formerwifelike him.[5]\nInEarth-11714, an aspect of The Other, as Miss Arrow, observed the early days ofPeter Parkeras Spider-Man. As a member of the \"Geek Chorus,\" she was the one who injectedSwiss Missinto the narrative, feeling that theSinister Sixcould use \"a woman's touch\".[29]\nInEarth-TRN461, Morlun almost killedSpider-Man. Peter merged with an aspect of The Other to kill Morlun, but was able to break free of the deity. The Other went on to merge with theKaine ParkerofEarth-14110. When theMultiversal Sinister Sixinvaded Earth-TRN461, The Other found herself back in Spider-Man's world as Kaine joined Peter'sSpider-Men. He used her power to help defeatMysterio, defendSpider-Punkduring his recruitment, and battle the Inheritors during theTotem War.[30]\nBonded to theKaine ParkerofEarth-14110\nThe Other isa powerful totemic spider-deitylinked to theWeb of Life and Destiny. It canbestow its receptacles with following powers:[9]"

This man, his parents and his sister Katy went to the trip in a bus, with some other forty people.\n\"Chemical X07\"\nTerrorist scientists fromA.I.M.were trying to destroy a chemical developed by themselves,Chemical X07, which apparently included enzymes to incite a rapid healing in human bodies. The accident killed all of the people in the bus, except for the man who would become Madcap. Coincidentally, this man laid unconscious for hours on a pool of X07, which would eventually evaporate. He would recover consciousness in a hospital, but then discovered that he was the sole survivor and his faith in a rational universe collapsed. He ran away from the hospital and threw himself to a car trying to commit suicide. To his surprise, he was unharmed and felt no pain at all. This drove him completely mad. He correctly suspected that the accident had given him this immunity to damage, but could not understand why he was to obtain power from an accident who had killed forty people, including his family and friends.[2]\nMadcap\nFinally, this man decided that things happen without a reason, and that nothing has a purpose. He soon discovered his other power, which allowed him to drive people crazy. He bought a bubble gun in a general store and stole a harlequin costume. He called himself the Madcap and wandered throughNew York Citydriving people crazy. He had no compunction about putting people in danger: as he could not be hurt, he could not understand that other people could be hurt.[2]\nDuring one of his first trips, he met newbie adventurerNomad, who was at that momentCaptain America's partner.[3]Nomad befriended Madcap, trying to understand his origins, motivations and powers. However, when Madcap began to threaten lives, Nomad was forced to knock him out and overcome him.[2]\nMadcap accidentally thwarted a heist, which put him in the sights of heist organizer theRoseand in the sights of amateur TV producerDollar Bill. A docudrama on Madcap staged by Bill led the Rose's men to Madcap with nefarious intentions.Daredeviltried to help Madcap, but could not prevent Madcap from burning to his apparent death - although soon Madcap reappeared to plague desperate Bill, demanding a TV show called Mystery Hour of Madcap.[4]\nMadcap was sent to a psychiatric hospital, but used his powers and became the host of The Mystery Hour of Madcap in New York TV. Madcap found child super heroesPower Packand tried to convince them to live adventures with him, but his adventures became dangerous and Power Pack left him. Madcap then moved away, dancing and singing about the fun of further adventures.[5]\nWhileShe-Hulkwas walking aroundLondon, the crazy Madcap decided that he was funnier than her, and that both She-Hulk and him should have owned her comic book, but he didn't know how would it end, and confronted her. In a park, he found her eating ice cream and started attracting people with jokes and tricks, and even making them join in with him. When children were put in danger, She-Hulk appeared to save them. Before she could do anything, Madcap took over her mind. After recovering her senses, She-Hulk confronted Madcap, only to be subdued again. While she was under his mind control, she started to fight against a fake whale, until she recovered again. Jen ran into a fake castle, where she tried to fight Madcap, who subdued her again. In that state, she grabbed him and took him somewhere he couldn't control anybody. After hurling him around and testing his regenerative abilities, she decided to give up, but when Madcap demanded her to give him the book, she ripped apart the page (with Madcap on it) into small pieces, dropped it into a garbage can and burned it. She explained that Madcap wasn't dead because he was \"just a drawing.\"[6]\nA further encounter withDr. Karl Malusled to Madcap accidentally touching one of Malus' inventions and, for the first time in a while, Madcap could be hurt and feel pain. It is unclear which of Malus' discoveries led to this. Madcap is left trying to find Malus, but he would lead his search through unusual methods, and likely unsuccessful ones. Malus is not aware of Madcap's search.[7]\nMadcap went on a rampage, but was stopped when he feltGhost Rider's Penance Stare. The experience left Madcap even more unhinged, and he began to crave the intense pain of the Ghost Rider's stare before being arrested.[8]\nShortly before theSecret Invasion, Madcap ran intoDeadpoolon a rooftop while the Merc with a Mouth was attempting a hit on Matt Murdock. There was a short quarrel between the two, where they compared healing factors, and a failed attempt to drive Deadpool insane lead to a battle with Daredevil andThor. Thor electrocuted the pair to dust while they were holding each other, so when they regenerated, only Deadpool seemed to survive. Madcap lived on inside Deadpool's mind, manifesting to Deadpool in the form of a white caption box until after the conflict between theAvengersand theX-Men, where similar circumstances split the pair apart once more.[9]\nMadcap was left emotionally damaged by his experience inside Deadpool's mind, mainly by the way Deadpool's subconscious interacted with Madcap, and Wade's ability to feel pain, something Madcap had never felt before.[10]Madcap's first attempt to defame Deadpool involved telepathically controlling security agents to kill the ambassador visiting the United States they were protecting, and pinning the murder on Deadpool, by luring him to the place of the crime with a phony job offer.\nMadcap as a Merc for Money\nHowever, Madcap accidentally hired another mercenary,Solo, who had been impersonating Deadpool to take jobs at a higher pay-rate. When Solo went to the scene as Deadpool, he caught notice of the oddity of the set-up and protected the ambassador, rescuing his life and causing the popular view on Deadpool to drastically change for the better.[11]When Deadpool founded hisMercs for Moneybased on Solo's M.O., Madcap showed up uninvited and managed to join the team simply because they couldn't get rid of him. Madcap's performance was deplorable, he missed numerous missions, and the ones he did go on, he acted disastrously. Despite this, Deadpool still didn't know of Madcap's true intentions.[12]\nMadcap began impersonating Deadpool to kill innocent people in his name and threaten his allies, he also used his mental manipulation to incite violence throughout the city so people would fear Deadpool again.[10]Once he discovered Madcap was the responsible behind the chaos in his life, Deadpool used his daughterEllieas a bait to lure Madcap and confront him once and for all. With the help of his allyMasacre, Deadpool continuously chopped down Madcap's limbs as they continued to regenerate. Madcap still managed to fully regenerate and threatened to use aChitaurihand cannon on Deadpool that would disintegrate him molecularly. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap wondered if he would be able to regenerate at the molecular level, and fired the weapon at himself.[13]\nMadcap attached to Bob's torso\nAs he began to regenerate, Madcap bonded to Deadpool's allyBob, becoming a malformed small creature attached to his abdomen and forcing him to do his bidding.[14]He carried out a new plan, luring Deadpool to a zoo and injecting him with a substance that turned him into the carrier of a fatal airborne virus, causing him to unwittingly infect the members of his family and put their lives at risk.[15]Deadpool managed to find a cure for the virus, and tracked down Madcap afterwards. He confronted the villain and Bob, just then discovering he was Madcap's host, and ultimately forcing Madcap to detach from Bob and run away.[16]\nEmotional Control:Madcap has a specialized form of mind control that makes targets highly susceptible to suggestion by him. Even without specific suggestions, Madcap's influence makes victims behave in a wild, uninhibited manner, in a form of temporary madness.[18]Madcap requires some form of medium to transmit his psionic power, but that medium can vary with his needs. He originally used a soap bubble gun to influence people who came into contact with the bubbles.[3]Deprived of the gun, he could still influence people by making eye contact with them.[2]If his opponent blindfolded themselves, Madcap could influence them by his voice alone.[19]"

Robert was born with no sense of touch, and constantly struggled through life coping with his inability to feel. Further, he had amazing recuperative powers that allowed him to heal from his injuries. As a young adult, Robert's inability to feel eventually drove him mad, and he attempted to commit suicide and was institutionalized.[1]\nRobert was institutionalized for fifteen years before he was visited by Thog, who was preparing his next major plot to take over the universe. Part of this plot was filling a series ofNightmare Boxeswhich retained emotional energy. A tower of these boxes would be constructed and used for his purposes. In order to fill more of these boxes, Thog turned Robert into the Scavenger. As the Scavenger, Robert had a deadly embrace which caused the memories, feelings and physical substance of people to be absorbed into his body. His victims were left lifeless husks, and he was granted extreme feelings of pleasure. These feelings were transmitted to his sister Danielle, who transferred these excess feelings into Nightmare Boxes.[2]\nEventually, Scavenger came into conflict with Thog's old foe, theMan-Thing, who interrupted one of his potential victims. When getting revenge on the Man-Thing, the bog-creature burned his perfect face.[3]However, this was fleeting and soon the burns faded and Scavenger began his murderous deeds anew. After murdering Elsbeth Duhl (the wife of another pawn of Thog), the Scavenger rested for the night.[1]\nBefore being given additional powers by Thog, Robert Nicolle could not physically feel anything. His body would not be alerted to outside stimuli touching his body, be it painful, pleasurable, etc. In addition to this, he also had an uncanny healing process that would allow his wounds to heal without any scars. He has been able to heal off burns, and scratches, he even survived an attempt to stab himself through the heart. The extent and origin of these abilities (be they genetic, or another manipulation by Thog) remain unrevealed.\nWhen Thog made a deal with Robert and changed him into the Scavenger, he granted him with more powers: Superior strength, enough of which to be able to fight the Man-Thing and over-power humans of average strength. He also gain the ability to fly, the limitations of either ability have yet to be determined.\nIn addition, he has the unique ability to drain the life-forces of people by a simple kiss. The process consumes a person's memories, and combined feelings experienced in a lifetime. Prolonged exposure to embrace causes the victim's flesh to disintegrate leaving behind only a skeleton and their clothing. The result of this life drain would cause the Scavenger feel extreme pleasure."

Then he went to theAvengerswho tried to take off the armor of him, thinking he was still drunk. He confronted them and fled toPym's lab where he hit him for having stolen hiswife Janetafter their divorce, but Tony managed to explain to him he was from the future, telling him about Pym's future technology ofOverspace. He then helped him and the Avengers defeatUltronbefore Pym gave him the repaired part of the Time Machine, and he fled into the time-stream, after admitting to Hank that he would go through some bad events of his life.[2]\nTony arrived inBritainduringJames Jaspers' reign as Prime Minister, he witnessed theBeetlesarbitrary arrests onmutantsinLondonand metCaptain Britain, who asked for help from him and theUSAagainst Jaspers. As the two heroes refused to help each other, Stark left.\nHe then presented himself as Tony Stark toVixenfor him to enter theS.T.R.I.K.E.complex by Captain Britain. Knocking Vixen down, he went on a search for the time machine fragment, finding it onDonald Birch, who was a prisoner of Vixen in this era. He debated the idea of killing him in order to prevent the fate of his world, but decided to leave instead. This was due to him feeling uncomfortable with the concept of preventive murder, having been confronted earlier with the Beetles arresting innocentmutantsand having heard part of Jaspers' interview on the subject of preventive arrests of powered beings.\nInstead, he left, but was quickly surrounded by the Beetles. Captain Britain and the British resistance came to fight Jaspers' soldiers and Braddock once again asked for help from Iron Man who refused and left using the machine.[2]\nBack inNew Yorkhe met theHeroes for Hire,Power ManandIron Fist.\nHe travelled then toLatveria's embassy, was made prisoner byDoctor Doom, escaped, made friends withJohnny Storm, met his past self once again, and battled Doctor Doom in the timestream. While travelling aboard theTime Platformthey arrived in various time points such asPennsylvaniain 1863 during theAmerican Civil War,Pompeiicausing theEruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, 270.000.000 B.C.,Tunguskain 1908causing a massive explosion.[3]\nHis next destination lead to him encountering the débutante artistDazzlerwho was being tracked by theKnightsof theHellfire Club.\nUsing his membership in the club, he infiltrated it to find a part of the time machine while being helped by Dazzler, who he counseled into thinking once again about joining theX-Men.\nHe was made a prisoner bySebastian Shawand battled him alongside the X-Men who came to battle the Black King. There he witnessed the Hellfire'sDark Phoenix, who destroyed the time-travelling machine before leaving to avoid meetingCyclops.[4]\nFor years, Tony Stark stayed stuck in the past, trying to complete the time machine. He was close to completing it, but his device was unstable. Realizing he could not complete the machine alone, Stark decided to visit Hank Pym and ask for his help.\nThe two of them then decided to work together, but Pym thought they should informReed Richardsin order to gain his help with the project. Stark, however, refused, stating that the only heroes who could be involved were the people he saw on Birch's screen: Captain Britain, Dazzler, Iron Fist, Cyclops, Power Man, Henry Pym, and Johnny Storm.\nFinally, he succeeded in recreating a time machine, and Stark gatheredhis alliesto go confront Birch in the present, leaving Pym behind as a back-up plan.[5]\nIron Man's death, savingPower Man\nThey came a little bit too late, as Donald Birch and Tony Stark of the present were already witnessing the arrival of the Dark Phoenix from the past.\nThe team confronted Birch's robots and the Phoenix, but the future Iron Man was killed while saving Power Man from the Phoenix fire, much to Birch's enjoyment.\nThey managed to defeat the Phoenix, and Birch died from a combination of his cancer and the severe shock of his failure."

Everbest.[3]While Everbest focused on \"fools\" from an extremist Christian perspective, Salinger was more secular. He found that \"fools\" were people who lacked poetry in their souls.[4]\nDespite his lack of super-powers, Foolkiller proved moderately successful in his crusade, even against super-heroes. An encounter with theDefendersended with Foolkiller completely demolishing their headquarters.[5]\nSalinger later enrolled inEmpire State University. He needed a science credit for his major, and developed a sincere liking for his T.A.,Peter Parker, who Salinger felt had a gift for explaining science in a poetic manner. Salinger and Parker soon crossed paths as Foolkiller and Spider-Man, however. While on the run from the web-slinger, Foolkiller hid in an alleyway with a homeless woman. When she heard what was going on, she remarked that \"only a fool\" would try to fight Spider-Man. Realizing she was right, Salinger almost disintegrated his own head before Spider-Man stopped him.[4]\nSalinger was committed to an institution for his crimes, and slowly overcame his suicidal tendencies, if not his hatred of fools. His doctors encouraged him to express himself, and he began writing about fools to newspapers and television programs. He eventually landed a TV interview from the institution, which led to secret correspondence withKurt Gerhardt.[6]\nWith Salinger's encouragement, Gerhardt became active as the new Foolkiller. Salinger had limited access to a computer at the institution, and the pair exchanged messages regularly through a private message board.[7]\nFoolkiller started working together with another vigilante namedYodman. Following Yodman's death during a mission to defeat theGrain Riper, Salinger began experiencing something akin to a midlife crisis, realizing he was no longer young and that could get sidelined or entirely out of commission. Greg started visiting psychologistAndrea Mansoor, who helped him find his vocation of helping people as a volunteer, specifically to help rehabilitate criminals. Inspired by Mansoor, Foolkiller decided to study psychology.[8]\nWhenDeadpoolfounded theMercs for Money, he employed the services of the Foolkiller, among numerous other vigilantes, to pose as him in order to extend his reach across the globe.[9]Greg began to juggle his life as a vigilante, a mercenary, and a psychology student. He eventually graduated, with Deadpool and the Mercs going to his graduation.[8]"

He helped her andDeadpooldefeat numerous dead Presidents which were revived into zombies by aNecromancer.[6]\nAfter Preston was killed by the zombiePresident Washington, he was one of the few people Deadpool told Preston's consciousness had survived after being put in his mind by the Necromancer, Adsit agreed to help them find a way to bring her back.[2]\nAdsit tried to get S.H.I.E.L.D. to build aLMDin which Preston's mind would be transferred, but discovered one had already been built. As part of a bait to trap corruptAgent Gorman, who was revealed to have built the LMD for shady purposes, Adsit told him about Preston's survival. He later met withAgent Coulson, the one who wanted to set the bait.[3]\nScott alerted Deadpool that the LMD of Preston he found was evil, and told him they were now part of Coulson's plan. When they were cornered by criminals who wanted to kill Deadpool for the price Gorman put on his head, Adsit and Deadpool were saved by Coulson, who took them inhis own S.H.I.E.L.D. flying cartoU.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.'s own helicarrier, where Gorman was meeting with the terrorist organization.[7]\nAfter Deadpool destroyed U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.'s helicarrier and slaughtered their members,[8]the organization tried to have revenge on him by killing his family and friends, Adsit was targeted while traveling in Manhattan, and even though he managed to defeat his attackers, he was heavily injured, but survived. After Deadpool retaliated and murdered all of U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.'s agents, he decided to give up his life as Deadpool. As he was celebrating the start of a new life with his friends and family, anincursionbetweenEarth-616and theEarth-1610caused the collision and destruction of both universe's planets Earth, with Deadpool and his allies dying in the process.[9]\nWhen the universe returned to life, so did the Earth and all of its inhabitants, including Scott. He left Deadpool's life,[10]but when he discovered Deadpool was planning on finding out his parent's killers, Adsit decided to pay him a visit and tell him the truth before anything bad could happen. However, the Deadpool he confessed to resulted being an impostor of the real one, who stabbed Scott in the back after learning of this information.[11]The impostor kidnapped Adsit, and had him tortured and tied to a chair until he was found by the real Deadpool, who had been lured by his copycat, who was ultimately revealed beingMadcap.[12]\nDeadpool rescued Adsit and brought him to theNight Nurse, who took care of him until Emily Preston had him leave.[13]Scott was later asked by Deadpool to join his mercenary agency, theMercs for Moneyin an organizational and tactical capacity.[5]Additionally, Adsit's new job allowed him to secretly oversee Deadpool and his teammates for S.H.I.E.L.D.[14]\nHe was later seen throwing away his S.H.I.E.L.D. badge before going with other ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to aid in the reformation of the Nova Corps. Since the new incarnation of the Corps did not share the Nova Force with the new recruits, Scott's experience with conventional weapons and his S.H.I.E.L.D. training allowed him to quickly elevate to the rank of commander.[15]\nWhen members of theChampionsreturnedWarbringerto Nova Corps custody, Adsit took custody ofSam Alexander'sNova helmet.[16]Sometime later,Kalderaand Sam arrived at one of the Nova Corps outposts where the helmet was located. The two took Adsit hostage and was forced to return the helmet, which he agreed to mostly because no one knew how to work it. To their shock, the helmet was missing. Upon discovering a member of theThieves Guildstole the helmet right under their noses, Adsit bemoaned both his hostage situation and losing the helmet.[17]"

Cross joined theCIAwith the intent to learn the secrets of the trade and to make contacts which might one day prove useful to him. He intended to use CIA training and knowledge to obtain a profit for himself.[1]\nAt this he met fellow CIA agentMarc Spector. They were stationed on top the roof of a building. Marc aims a high-powered sniper rifle at a building across the street, just as military officials escort a prisoner across the quad. He executes a blond haired woman who apparently revealed highly classified state secrets. Cross indicates that she had been previously brainwashed, and that she only revealed information already programmed inside her mind. Executing her was done merely to make the Germans and the Russians nervous.[2]\nHe was romantically linked toRozalyn Backus. She was unaware of his illegal activities, and helped develop experimental ultrasonic technology. The couple were engaged to be married until he ran off with the technology. In his disappearance he faked his own murder and framed Backus for the murder.[1]\nQuitting the CIA soon after, Cross used his skills and resources to begin a number of highly profitable criminal operations including drug trafficking, extortion, and assassinations. Assuming the codename Crossfire, he diverted a portion of his profits to hire a small army of mercenaries to serve as his enforcers. Crossfire's goal became to foment disorder and subversion within society in order to make a profit. At one point in his career, some of his enemies booby-trapped his headquarters. The ensuing explosion robbed him of his left eye and ear, plus 85% of his hearing. He replaced his losses with cybernetic equipment. Crossfire eventually located the men who had injured him, and eliminated them personally.[1]\nCross eventually decided that the existence of superhumanly powerful crime-fighters posed a threat to his operations. He poured his monetary resources into the refinement of his ultrasonic brainwashing device, with which he hoped to brainwash all superhumans into battling one another to the death. To test the effectiveness of his machine, he arranged to abduct theThing. Coincidentally, the Thing's plight was witnessed byMoon Knight, who was secretly fellow ex-CIA Marc Spector. The Moon Knight recognized Crossfire and went to help the Thing to defeat Crossfire's private army. Together, the Thing and Moon Knight managed to destroy the mind-control machine. Crossfire himself, however, escaped.[1]\nDespite this set-back, Cross began work on the construction of a new, advanced model of his ultrasonic brainwashing device. He arranged to have certain components constructed atCross Technologies, a firm founded by his cousin, Darren Cross. Learning that theAvengerHawkeyewas employed as a security guard at CTE, Crossfire devised a plan to use Hawkeye, whom he believed to be the weakest of the costumed crime-fighters, as bait to lure other superhumans into his clutches where he could subject them to his brainwashing machine. To capture Hawkeye, Crossfire hired a trio of costumed criminals: theSilencer,Oddball, andBombshell. Cross' minions managed to take Hawkeye and his companionMockingbirdcaptive, and Crossfire used his ultrasonic weapon to make them fight each other. During this fight, Hawkeye suffered permanent hearing damage. However, Hawkeye eventually escaped and defeated Crossfire and his henchmen. The second machine was destroyed, and Crossfire was arrested and sentenced to prison. His subordinates were rescued by Oddball's brotherTenpin.[3][4]\nFrom prison, Crossfire discovered that Oddball and Bombshell belonged to a criminal team called theDeath-Throws, a troupe of costumed criminal jugglers. Crossfire contacted and hired them to release him in exchange for a sum of money, which he would pay after being freed. Crossfire had no money at that point; his devices had been confiscated by the police, and he had lost any link to Cross Technologies. The Death-Throws staged an attack on the prison and kidnapped the prisoner Crossfire. Once they had taken him to their HQ, they discovered that Cross had no money. They considered killing him in revenge, but they eventually decided to use the \"fugitive\" as a bait to attract Hawkeye andCaptain Americato a trap. However, Hawkeye and Captain America defeated the Death-Throws and sent Crossfire back to prison.[5]\nCross later escaped and put a bounty on Hawkeye's arm, hoping to destroy the hero's archery skills and break his spirit. An army of criminals consisting ofRazor-Fist,Brothers Grimm,Bobcat,Bullet Biker,Mad-Dog, and theDeath-Throwslooked to claim the reward.[6]They, however, were defeated by Hawkeye teaming up with Mockingbird andTrick Shot (Buck Chisholm). Hawkeye pursued Cross through the sewers. During the chase, Cross was knocked over and found himself clinging to a lege for his life, but Hawkeye rescued him so he would rot in prison.[7]\nCross seeking revenge followed the newly married Hawkeye and Mockingbird to the estate of former film starMoira BrandonThe elderly actress was declared an honorary Avenger after she helped them take down Cross.[8]\nCross was one of the many mercenaries hired byArcadeto hunt and killAgent X.[9]\nCross was recruited byLucia von Bardasto attack Nick Fury and a group of heroes who were involved in aSecret WarinLatveriaa year earlier.[10]The hired mercenaries were each a component of a bomb designed to destroy the city.[11]Fury and the team were able to stop them and arrested them all including Cross.[12]\nWhile in prison Cross met and befriendedVector (Simon Utrecht)of theU-Foeswhose secret power to nullify technology, he hoped to exploit. Cross was imprisoned in theVaultwhere Rozalyn Backus part of Vault'sGuardsman force. She seemingly stopped an escape attempt by Cross and the U-Foes, but it was revealed she stole cash and goods from the criminals, including Vector's power nullification chamber.[13]The criminals were later transferred to theRaft, and all escaped duringElectro's mass breakout, Cross worked with a team of mind-manipulators:Mandrill,Controller,Mister Fear, andCorruptor. While on pursuit of Rozalyn the U-Foes andCrossfire's Crewfought a gang war until theNew Avengersstopped.[14]Cross and his gang were recaptured and Backus surrendered herself to the authorities.[15]\nCross and his Death-Throws were hired byR.A.I.D.as part of a terrorist plot against the city ofLondon. They were tasked with causing massive civilian casualties amongst citizens fleeing London on Tower Bridge. They were opposed by the Israeli superheroineSabra, who Crossfire temporarily blinded by shooting her directly in the eye. A partially blinded Sabra is still able to defeat the villains thanks to the arrival and help ofUnion Jack. The Death-Throws are captured while Crossfire fell off of the bridge into the Thames River, prompting Union Jack to believe that he had presumably drowned.[16]\nCross was among theHood's army of criminals, who took advantage of the superheroCivil Warcaused by theSuperhuman Registration Act.[17]The team go on to battle the New Avengers. He battled his old enemy Hawkeye now operating under the Ronin identity.[18]\nCross and Hood's Hood's Gang work with the heroes to stop theSkrull Invasion.[19][20]After the Invasion was defeated the gang battled the New Avengers, who were laying in wait for theDark Avengers. Cross had the opportunity to fight his longtime foes Hawkeye and Mockingbird again.[21][22]\nCross and the Hood planned to use theZombie Virusto gain more power and influence in the world. Cross however protested as the main reason he teamed up with the Hood was they would not pursue world conquering schemes.[23]\nCross and the other members rebelled against their leader and attempted to make their own deal withNorman Osborn. They attack and defeated the New Avengers and took out the Dark Avengers.[24][25][26][27][28]\nCross and the gang took part in theSiegeofAsgard.[29]\nHawkeye and Mockingbird stopped Cross' illegal arms dealings. He was later confronted byPhantom Rider (Jaime Slade), together along with theDeath T.H.R.O.W.S.they attempted to destroy their mutual enemy.[30]They however failed, but severely wounded Mockingbird's motherSusan, and murderedPhantom Rider (Hamilton Slade). Cross was captured by Hawkeye and beaten to an inch of his life.[31]Hawkeye later discovered thatBaron Helmut Zemowas the benefactor behind the illegal arms dealings.[32]Luke Cagetold Hawkeye that as long as he was the leader of theThunderbolts, Crossfire would never be allowed on the team.[33]\nCrossfire joinedMisty Knight's Crewalong withTiger Shark,Bombshell, andNightshade. The team was set up to defeatPurple Manand hisVillains for Hire.[34]When the two teams battled, Misty found most of her team abandoned her when they were offered more money to join Purple Man.[35]Cross was the only member who did not abandon Misty, citing professionalism and honor, and his prize for this was being shot and left for dead byScourge.[36]\nCross was recruited byMax Furyto join theShadow Council'sMasters of Evil.[37]He was later seen inBagaliabeing paid off byNick Fury, Jr.to let theTaskmasterout of his imprisonment at the time when theSecret Avengersraided Bagalia to recruit Taskmaster.[38][39]"

Members of this clan took in a fugitiveassassinand nursed him back to health with herbal remedies and hot springs. A young monkey disagreed with this, fearing that someone would eventually come looking for the hitman. Once the nameless assassin regained his health, he began to hone his skills using snowmen as practice dummies and the young monkey studied him. The assassin's health deteriorated during the continued winter and the monkey tribe did all they could to help him, having accepted him as one of their own. The young monkey resorted to physical violence against the members of his clan over the continued presence of the assassin and was cast away because of this. Days into his exile, the young monkey spotted a group of soldiers in the woods who were looking for the assassin. He rushed to the clan to warn them, but did not make it in time and witnessed as the assassin and the other monkeys were slain. Seeking vengeance, the young monkey picked up the assassin's pistols and killed the soldiers, becoming Hit-Monkey.[1]\nThe spirit of the deceased hitman manifested following Hit-Monkey's first murders, and he guided the macaque into finding his killers' patron, a politician namedHideki Hiyashiwho was in turn working forGeneral Kato, the duo's ultimate target. Arriving atTokyo, Hit-Monkey attacked Hiyashi but accidentally killed his innocent assistant. Anguished by having accidentally taken an innocent life, Hit-Monkey forfeited his guns and retreated until the assassin's ghost encouraged him to keep on going.[2]The next day, Hit-Monkey learned from a newspaper that General Kato's daughter was getting married. He infiltrated the wedding, stealing the suit and tie from a toddler. Chaos broke out after the guests realized Hit-Monkey wasn't a trained animal ring-bearer, and the macaque was confronted by General Kato's newest bodyguard,Bullseye. Evading the hitman, Hit-Monkey infiltrated General Kato's safe room and decapitated him. Ashamed that he had been bested by a monkey, Bullseye murdered the rest of Kato's men. Shocked by this turn of events, Hit-Monkey came to the realization of the dangers of vengeance. The spirit of the assassin also revealed itself to be a fragment of Hit-Monkey's own mind, meaning it was a manifestation of his self-indulgent desire for revenge. The toddler whose suit Hit-Monkey had stolen found and hugged him, unwittingly shielding him from Bullseye's throwing knife and dying. The boy's death motivated Hit-Monkey to now seek revenge for the innocents whose blood had been spilled and not for himself.[3]\nHit-Monkey and his mentor's hallucination\nBelieving Hit-Monkey to have been a trained pawn, Bullseye fled to track down his alleged master. In the streets, Hit-Monkey made acquaintances with a fashion model named Misami, who was followed by Bullseye hoping to find answers about Hit-Monkey's non-existent owner. The confrontation was interrupted by a gang targeting Misami. A fight broke out and although Hit-Monkey defeated Bullseye, Misami was killed by a stray bullet. The part of Hit-Monkey that manifested as his mentor's ghost chastised him for his reluctance to use firearms since they could have dealt with Bullseye faster and prevent the bloodbath. After killing the gangsters, Hit-Monkey set out to become a necessary evil and a killer of killers.[4]\nIn the following years, Hit-Monkey became an urban legend among assassins for his modus operandi of targeting hitmen. Traveling around the world, he would take down multiple targets before disappearing. Arriving atNew York City, one of Hit-Monkey's targets was a deli owner who was secretly a gun-for-hire. The deli owner was a friend of local heroSpider-Man, and he suspected known hitmanDeadpoolof being the murderer. Investigating the crime scene, Deadpool recognized Hit-Monkey's work and encouraged Spider-Man to work together.[5]After visiting another of Hit-Monkey's crime scenes, Spider-Man lured him to his rendezvous with Deadpool, who was the monkey's next target. During the subsequent fight, Hit-Monkey accidentally injured Spider-Man with a bullet. The macaque fled after leaving Deadpool for dead in a hail of bullets, unaware that his target possessed a healing factor.[6]In order to put down Hit-Monkey for good, Deadpool exploited the remorse he had shown during their fight after injuring Spider-Man. Stealing Spider-Man's costume, Deadpool injured himself and left himself to die publicly. A funeral was held and Hit-Monkey attended it out of remorse, thinking he had caused Spider-Man's death. Deadpool bursted out of the casket and attempted to kill Hit-Monkey, but Spider-Man intervened and convinced him to simply subdue him. Deadpool tried to have a heart-to-heart with Hit-Monkey, but the macaque attacked him and stole one of his firearms. Spider-Man had bent the barrel of Deadpool's guns to prevent him from using them, and the two hitmen decided to fire at each other despite that. This caused an explosion that Hit-Monkey used as a cover to escape.[7]\nFighting Spider-Man and Deadpool\nDeadpool would cross paths with Hit-Monkey again shortly after having lost his healing factor. With his outlook on life changed, Deadpool attempted to talk Hit-Monkey out of his violent lifestyle. Revealing that he could see Hit-Monkey's hallucination of the spectral assassin due to his own insanity, Deadpool convinced him that the ghost was not real and that he didn't need to continue his path in life. The hallucination vanished, and Hit-Monkey ripped off his suit and lept away.[8]Seemingly finding a new purpose in life, Hit-Monkey joined theHowling CommandosofS.T.A.K.E., a sub-division ofS.H.I.E.L.D.in charge of dealing with supernatural threats.[9]\nMercs for Money"

Now a Chinese superhero his nationality lead into conflict with many American heroes.[4]He was a founding member of theMasters of Evilwho were created to destroy theAvengers.[5]He later joined thePeople's Defense Force, charged with protecting his homeland.[6]\nDr. Chen Lu was a respected nuclear physicist for the People's Republic of China. After the thunder godThorthwarted a Chinese military incursion intoIndia, the Chinese government called upon its scientists and military strategists for a way to retaliate against Thor. Chen Lu had already been experimenting for several years with a way of harnessing nuclear radioactivity to induce superhuman powers in human beings. Chen Lu, concealing his own aspirations of world conquest, volunteered to become China's human weapon against Thor.[4]\nRadioactive Man's first appearance\nHaving already spent months immunizing himself against the harmful effects of radiation, Chen Lu exposed himself to massive doses of specific-particle radiation, thereby mutating his body. After impressing his superiors with a demonstration of the new superhuman powers he had gained, Chen Lu, calling himself the Radioactive Man.[7]There are two different accounts as to what happened next. In the original account, the Radioactive Man was smuggled into New York City where he battled Thor. Thor used a massive vortex to send the Radioactive Man back to China before he could reach critical mass and explode.[4]The second account states that the Radioactive Man attacked Thor along the India/China border. During the battle the Radioactive Man forced Thor to recall how he was banished to Earth, causing a brief reversion back to Donald Blake. However Blake regained his hammer and defeated the Radioactive Man. In the aftermath of the battle the American government -- through Tony Stark -- thanked Thor for his assistance, but their ability to make a connection between Donald Blake and himself did not sit well with the thunder god.[8]\nIn fact however, the Radioactive Man went into hiding untilBaron Heinrich Zemolocated him and enlisted him in his criminal organization, the originalMasters of Evil. By this time, the Radioactive Man was no longer serving China's Communist leaders.

This second Masters of Evil was also defeated by the Avengers, and the Radioactive Man was imprisoned in a cell designed especially to restrain a being with his powers.[9][10]\nAfter breaking out of prison, the Radioactive Man fled to Communist controlledVietnam, where he briefly teamed up with theTitanium Manand the thirdCrimson Dynamoas theTitanic Three, champions of Eastern Communism. These three former Communist agents had decided to serve their former masters no longer and wanted no longer to be considered criminals. In Communist controlled Vietnam, the Titanic Three instead acted to punish criminals.[11]However, the Titanic Three later broke up under circumstances that have yet to be revealed.[12][13][14]\nEventually, the Radioactive Man was contacted by criminal scientistElihas Starr, otherwise known as \"Egghead\", and agreed to join yet another incarnation of the Masters of Evil.[15]But after Dr.Henry Pymdefeated the group single-handedly, the Radioactive Man was deported by the United States government.[16]\nHe later entered the service of theMandarin, who sent him up againstJames Rhodes, the second Iron Man.[17]\nRadioactive Man captured Spider-Man for his experiments, and discovered his radioactive powers could temporarily cancel the wall-crawler's own. However, Spider-Man was rescued by Iron Man.[18]\nRadioactive Man was one of the many villains imprisoned in theVault.[19]\nHe also clashed with theShe-HulkandDeath's Head.[20]Radioactive Man, along with many other villains, battled the newly formedThunderbolts.[21]\nChen Lu joined theThunderboltsafter they declared their intention to stopFathom Five, Atlantean terrorists who had attacked China.[22]The Radioactive Man helped the Thunderbolts whenHydrastaged a major attack on New York City.[23]\nLu became very close toSongbird, who succeeded MACH-IV as leader of the Thunderbolts. They made a deal with the Commission on Superhuman Activities to test the New Avengers (who refused to work under government jurisdiction, making them loose cannons).[24][25][26][27]\nDuring theCivil WarChen Lu helpedHank PymandReed Richardsbuild a holding prison for dissenting super powered individuals. He and his team also battled theAnti-Registration Underground.[28]The team encountered theElders of the Universemember theGrandmaster, whose manipulations of theWellspring of Powercritically limited their manpower, reducing the existing roster of Thunderbolts to three.[29]\nNew Costume\nThe Thunderbolts reformed after Civil War as both the Colorado branch of the Initiative and the CSA's official unregistered superhuman hunters. Lu remained with the Thunderbolts voluntarily, unlike many of their members, on loan from the Chinese government. He wore a radiation suit as part of his costume as part of public relations maneuvering to make him seem more threatening while disguising his Asian features to improve the team's approval numbers in the more racist parts of America. He helped the Thunderbolts bring in various unregistered heroes such asJack Flagand theSteel Spider.[30]\nThe Radioactive Man was disheartened to learn that his activities with the Thunderbolts were not just a \"good will\" mission -- Beijing actively wanted him away from China to avoid any further deaths or instability due to his powers. His ally the Collective Man told Lu he was still a favored son of China, but was not welcome home.[31]\nChen and the team battled Spider-Man andAnti-Venom. But during the fight, Chen had a portion of his radiation drained by Anti-Venom.[32]\nChen continued with the group however, going after the superheroMoon Knight.[33][34]\nDuring theSecret Invasionof theSkrulls, Osborn andMoonstone (Karla Sofen)began a plan to neutralize the Thunderbolts who would oppose him in his planned to exploit the invasion for his own personal agenda, in order to gain more power.[35]Osborn arranged for Chen to be deported back to China, destroying his relationship with Songbird. Melissa was forced to let him go without much of a goodbye because Bullseye was secretly threatening her with a knife during Lu's departure.[36]\nHe joined China'sPeople's Defense Forcea group of superhumans created to protect his home country.[6]Radioactive Man demonstrated that at close proximity he can safely absorb the radiation ofInhumans;Xerogen Crystalsand also, presumably, safely absorbTerrigen Mist.[37]However, the People's Defense Force is largely defeated by an invading entity known as TheUnspoken, a deposed former king of the Inhumans. The Unspoken is defeated in China by theMighty Avengers.[38]\nRadiation Absorption & Manipulation:Exposure to high levels of radiation has mutated Chen Lu's body. As a result, Lu's primary superhuman power is the ability to absorb and manipulate high levels of radiation for a number of purposes and effects. In the case of other beings that have received powers based from exposure to radiation, Lu can manipulate the radiant energies of those individuals usually for the purposes of temporarily shutting down their powers. Lu can also purposely lower the levels of radiation within himself. Although he can only do so for short periods of time, he can cause his skin to look normal.[40]"

She also pointed out that she experienced the same vision during the class. At that point,Cassandra Nova's giganticWild Sentinelsappeared on Genosha and wiped out half the world's mutant population: 16 million people.[5]Ellie and her mother were both killed in this massacre.[7]\nEllie's corpse was carried by Emma Frost, who had survived the Genoshan genocide thanks to her secondary mutation, when she was found byBeastandJean Grey. Emma proclaimed the teenager to be a credit to her family and the mutant race and suffered a mental breakdown when she found out Ellie was dead.[1]\nWhen Emma Frost's subconscious began attacking theX-Mendue to a telepathic attack planted byCassandra Nova, Negasonic Teenage Warhead appeared as a member of theInner Circle of the Hellfire Clubwiththe Black KingandPerfection.[9]\nShe faced off againstKitty Prydeand predicted she'd uncontrollably phase through the ground, which caused her to do so.[10]The telepathic projection of Ellie was \"murdered\" byCyclopswhen he shot her with a handgun.[11]\nEllie rising from the dead\nEllie was one of the many thousands of deceased mutants resurrected bySelenewith the help ofEli Bard'sTechno-Organic Virus.[6]AfterDestiny's escape,[12]Ellie joinedThunderbirdandCalibanas one of Selene's righthand slaves.[13]\nEllie resurfaced sometime later, seemingly alive and well again. She was targeted for apprehension byDeadpooland hisMercs for Moneyon behalf ofUmbral Dynamics, and used her precognitive abilities to single-handedly defeat most of the Mercs, before Wade himself approached to reason with her. Ellie agreed to accompany him, but not before having a series of precognitive flashes presaging disaster to come.[4]Umbral's CEOCaroline Le Fayused Ellie's power, and those of other victims captured by Deadpool, to bring thePresenceback to life. In the process, Ellie's abilities were expanded, allowing her to demonstrate superhuman strength.[14]\nDeadpool eventually learned of Umbral's use of the abductees with ill-intent, and set out to save them.[15]Not only did he and the Mercs of Money eventually succeed, but Ellie proved crucial to the Presence's defeat, siphoning back all the energy that was keeping him alive. Following the thwarting of Le Fay's plans, Negasonic decided to stay with the Mercs for Money.[16]Even thoughDominotook the reins of leadership of the Mercs from Deadpool, Ellie supported Wade and remained loyal to him above all, since he was the one who had saved her from Umbral.[17]\nWhen theM-Poxcrisis reached its climax and the X-Men went to war against theInhumansover the toxicity of theTerrigenCloud, Ellie almost used her powers of reality warping to render the cloud harmless to mutants.

While she was on KrakoaEmma Frosthelped her to figure out how her powers worked, and Ellie then intentionally get rid of her reality warping power.[2]\nOne day, while on a mission with Deadpool, Ellie had a vision of her future where she was put on a trial by theTime Variance Authorityfor knowingly risking the existence of the universe while entire reality was breaking apart around them. It was happening because she rejected her reality warping power. Without it the chain of events of her life was changed, she hadn't metYuki Oharawith whom she was supposed to fell in love and had a kiss on an alien moon. The kiss was a fixed point in time, it was supposed to happen, by circumventing it she created an irresolvable anomaly.

SaleFirstMen's Adventures#26(November, 1953)\nIrises:\nHuman form\nThere are two accounts explaining how Kenneth Hale became the Gorilla-Man. The earliest account suggested that Hale was plagued by nightmares of a Gorilla-Man in deepest Africa. Becoming obsessed with finding the Gorilla-Man, Hale traveled to Africa where he tracked down the mythic beast and fought it to death. In killing the Gorilla-Man, Ken Hale himself was transformed into a new Gorilla-Man.[2]\nBecoming Gorilla-Man[3]\nHowever, the true account of Ken Hale's transformation into the Gorilla-Man is much more detailed. A soldier of fortune, Ken Hale lived for thrills and adventure. Fearing old age and death, he sought immortality on the African continent. He heard tell of a gorilla that stands like a man, and that if he killed it, he would live forever, never aging. He hunted the beast, but when he met it, he could not kill it. Leaving it alive, Hale wandered the jungle, becoming lost and sick. The gorilla found him and forced Ken Hale's hand. Ken killed the beast in self-defense, not knowing that he had just taken the curse of the Gorilla-Man upon himself. He obtained his immortality, but it came along with spending the rest of his immortal life in the body of a gorilla.[3]\nHiding out in the jungles of Africa, the Gorilla-Man was eventually approached by FBI agentJimmy Woowho recruited him into hisG-Men. Their first mission was to savePresident Eisenhowerfrom theYellow Clawin his Mongolian fortress. The president was rescued but the Yellow Claw escaped. 6 Months later the G-Men were disbanded.[4]\nChuck Yeagerlater took Gorilla-Man up for a joy ride in theBell X-1, the world's first super-sonic jet.[5]\nIn the Fall of 1959, Gorilla-Man saved the life of General Hill when he was the target of an assassination attempt byICON.Powell McTeaguehad warnedNick Furyabout the danger to the General's life. Fury toldNamora, who telephoned Woo. Woo, in turn, contacted Hale and asked him to stake out the general's house. When the two men investigated the assassin's body, however, they discovered that the man appeared to have been dead for days prior to his being shot.[6]\nWhenXaviervanished after sending out a telepathic distress call, Miriam Christiansen suggested Hale as a guide to her nephewAngel. The X-Men eventually located Xavier within a cave with an entrance carved to resemble a face. The cave's mouth closed when they entered and the X-Men were overwhelmed by feelings of despondency. Hale was unaffected and forcedCyclopsto breach the cave roof with his optic blasts and then helped the X-Men escape. After the cave's collapse, Hale declined to return to the US with the X-Men.[7]\nBy the modern age, the Gorilla-Man was recruited by Nick Fury intoS.H.I.E.L.D.'sHowling Commandosunit. The Howling Commandos launched an assault on a doomsday cult that was utilizing technology bought from theLords of the Living Lightning.[8]\nGorilla-Man was to track down and captureGroot. Afterwards, He andWarwolfmet with the Commandos' newest recruit,The Globand explained their situation to him.[9]\nWhenGoombroke out of his cell, Gorilla-Man brought him down single-handedly. He then discussed with Groot the terms and conditions of being a member of the squad. When the recently-freed Merlin's forces attacked, Gorilla-Man was among the Commandos to face them down.[10]\nWith Area 13 overrun by Merlin's forces, Warwolf and Gorilla-Man realized that the portal to Merlin's location was still open. They had the cells of the giant monsters being held opened, and jumped through the portal just before a stampede of monsters followed them.[11]\nThe Commandos waited just outside of Merlin's camp, and were soon joined by dozens of other Commando members who followed them through the portal. The group then launched an assault on Merlin's forces. During the battle, Gorilla-Man and Warwolf located Merlin, who fled when he realized he couldn't win this fight.[12]\nRescuing Jimmy Woo with the Aid of M-11[4]\nAfter Jimmy Woo was seriously injured on a rogue mission, he was found by S.H.I.E.L.D. with very little brain function and taken back to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and put on life support.Duganbrought in Gorilla-Man for questioning as the only clues they had linked this mission to the original G-Men and Hale was the only member they could contact. With no knowledge of what Woo had done, Hale requested to say a final goodbye, but Hale instead contactedM-11andMarvel Boywho rescue him. Marvel Boy was able to restore Woo by reconstructing him as he last remembered Woo, which was from there time together in the 1950s. This restored his youth, at the expense of Woo's memories of the intervening 50 years.[4]\nThe quartet traveled to Woo's house for clues and findDerek Khanataalready there. After takingJimmy Woo's Carand Marvel Boy taking an imprint of the house, the G-Men attempted to leave without Khanata but Khanata reveals he has discovered the whereabouts ofVenus. Travelling with the group to Africa, the G-Men met Khanata's cousin, who found Venus at the site of Gorilla-Man's transformation, having turned the war torn area peaceful. But soon after their arrival Yellow Claw attacked the group.[3]\nAfter a small scuffle Yellow Claw was revealed to have been a robot and Jimmy was rescued by his team-mates. Leaving Africa with Venus, the team return to where Jimmy was initially injured in hopes of finding a temple, however they find nothing. Leaving M-11 behind, Woo and team travel to an old coffee shop Woo used to visit, Gorilla-Man reveals M-11 visited him before S.H.I.E.L.D. did to inform Hale that he needed to rescue Woo and Marvel Boy revealed his origins and how there was a second version of himself. As the story concludes, the team sees M-11 trying to travel to Antarctica since he has concluded that Namora isn't dead and needs to be rescued. Travelling there they find what appears to be the remains of Namora.[13]\nNamora was revealed to be alive by Marvel Boy and while M-11 freed Namora, the rest of the team were attacked by giant crabs and were rescued by a newly revived Namora. Feeling that he has taken his team away from their lives, Jimmy tries to send the rest of the team home but they all refused and plan to continue helping him investigating. Using a list compiled by Woo before he lost his memories, they began to investigate all possible operations of the Atlas Foundation, with every single site they visit being one. After taking down some pirates, the team is attacked again by Yellow Claw and his terracotta army, in the fight Yellow Claw escaped and not even Grayson could detect his presence.[14]\nDuring the search,Namorarevealed the secret about Venus' true nature, having known of the legend of the Siren. Venus fell into depression and filled all of her companions with despair. This caused Marvel Boy to reveal the fact that Jimmy suspected M-11 of being the traitor in the midst. Feeling betrayed Marvel Boy attacked and seemingly destroyed M-11 due to the fact he had abandoned the Uranians forever just to be used as a puppet. This angered Namora who felt M-11 had cared enough to track her down and free her and destroyed Marvel Boy's spaceship and attacked Marvel Boy himself. Gorilla-Man jumped to Marvel Boy's aid so Namora attacked him as well. While the rest of the team began to fight each other, Woo calmed her and was able to help her rediscover her confidence Venus proceeded to sing, soothing the rest of the team and they returned to their mission to take down the Atlas group.[15]\nWoo and his team go back to the San Francisco branch of Atlas and re-enter the hidden room. This time, they survive and confrontYellow ClawandMr. Lao. It turns out that Yellow Claw was waiting for Woo to come, to claim the mantle of Genghis Khan. With the title of Great Khan, Woo also assumed control over the holdings of The Atlas Foundation. Jimmy then asked Khanata to lie to S.H.I.E.L.D. and tell them that they actually perished in the temple so they can continue in secret.[16]\nThe transition away from being a criminal organization was not easy however as one of the the early missions after becoming the Atlas foundation involved a rogue faction of the organization who did not want to stop their criminal activities. Using a theatre production they would use the audiences life force, combined with a totemic vessel to create an army of monsters. The group teamed up withSpider-Manto stop them, after him and the group were attacked. Initially unsure which side the group was on Spider-Man fought with Gorilla-Man until Siren used her song to calm him down. Gorilla-Man vouched that Spider-Man was a hero so they teamed up and stopped the rogue faction when M-11 destroyed their power source at theRockefeller Center. In order to keep. their existence a secret, Marvel Boy wiped everybody but his team's memory of the incident including Spider-Man's.[17]\nDuring theSecret Invasion, Namora killed aSuper-Skrulland was captured by otherSkrulls. She was later rescued by Gorilla-Man and M-11, and returned to Marvel Boy's Ship with a Skrull as a hostage. Their location was discovered and the team defended the ship while Jimmy asked Venus to us her powers to the kill the attackers. Venus didn't want to use her powers to kill and Marvel Boy revealed that the Skrulls were not malevolent and just wanted to join the human and Skrull races together. Jimmy however, was defending the human race and got M-11 to wipe out all the attacking Skrulls.[18]\nThe Atlas Foundation hindered the Skrulls' activities on the West Coast during theirInvasion. Afterwards, however, the world had changed, and Woo and his team took a surprising step: to use Plan Chu's villainous reputation to present themselves as the Agents of the Atlas Empire. Their first act was to steal all the gold inFort Knox, whichNorman Osbornhad earmarked for special weapons programs.[19]\nMystical Enchantment:As a result of killing the last Gorilla-Man, Hale has inherited the enchantment ofNgiand has been physically transformed into a gorilla. As a result of his transformation, Hale possesses various attributes associated with the enchantment:"

He hired theRocket Racerto steal documents that could incriminate him. Racer delivered the documents to Weele but withheld the Minerva Document, the most damning piece of evidence, for an additional $10.000 or else he would turn the evidence over to the authorities. Distraught, Weele went to the docks to commit suicide, but was saved at the last second by the Racer, who still demanded full payment. The Racer told Weele that with hisTinkerer-built, jet-powered skateboard, he could continue to hound Weele until he paid up. The mention of the Tinkerer gave Weele an idea.[3]\nWeele hired the Tinkerer to create for him a weapon powerful enough to take on the Rocket Racer. Inspired by Weele's name, as well as the disparaging nickname the Racer had given him, \"Big Wheel,\" the Tinkerer created agiant, armored monowheeloutfitted with machine guns and rocket launchers. Weele ambushed the Rocket Racer while he was in the middle of a fight withSpider-Man. The Racer tired to flee by weaving in and out of traffic but the Big Wheel just crushed all the cars in its path. The Racer skated up the side of a building but, despite its great size, the Big Wheel followed. Spider-Man arrived at that moment to apprehend the Rocket Racer. He managed to get Racer out of the way seconds before the Big Wheel crushed them. Unable to stop in time, the Big Wheel drove off the side of the building and fell into the Hudson River. Jackson Weele and the Big Wheel itself were presumed lost.[4]\nWeele survived due to the Big Wheel being watertight, and the fiasco made him realize the error of his ways. He went home to accept the consequences of his actions, and his wifeMargaretwalked out on him. Jackson went to prison, where he joined a twelve-step program for super villains calledVil-Anon. Step nine of the program involved making amends with those he wronged so he decided to help Spider-Man fight crime. After a failed attempt at capturingStilt-Man, and a successful, if destructive, attempt at stopping theShockerfrom robbing a bank, Spider-Man encouraged Weele to follow a different career path. Weele started performing at monster truck rallies crushing cars and became a spokesperson for Vil-Anon.[5]\nBy the time of thesuperhuman civil war, Weele had returned to a life of crime.[6]He also joined a black market network that specialized in super-tech.Iron Manbecame aware of this network during his efforts to thwart one of its clients,Ezekiel Stane.[7]Spider-Man tagged along when Iron Man set out to shut it down. Weele panicked when the heroes came after him, and bursted out of his home on the Big Wheel. The two heroes worked together to stop and arrest him.[8]\nWhenBlackoutassembled a team to kill both the two Ghost Riders,Johnny Blazeand his brotherDaniel Ketch, Big Wheel was one of the super villains hired into the group.[9]Weele was the first to attack the two brothers, and eventually confronted Blaze alone. His Big Wheel was destroyed, and Blaze used thePenance Stareon Jackson to incapacitate him.[10]\nAfterward, Big Wheel became one of numerous super villains tricked into the service ofCat. Cat was the founder of a secret and secluded community namedMoon's Hollow, a refuge for the maligned and mistreated families of super villains. Under the pretense that their families had been kidnapped, Cat coerced the villains into doing her bidding.[11]Spider-Woman's investigation into the apparent mass kidnappings led her to Big Wheel, who refused to admit he was being coerced and denied any knowledge.[12]"

He is the traditional protector of his New Mexican tribe, although Fireheart himself often questions the traditional rituals that his uncleJoseph Threetrees, the tribe's Shaman, espouses. In his Puma identity, Fireheart is an internationally known professional assassin and mercenary who sells his unique skills to the likes of theRoseand theKingpin. As the CEO ofFireheart Enterprises, he is also internationally known in his civilian identity.[7]\nPuma first crossed the path ofSpider-Manwhen he was hired by the Rose to \"remove\" the Web-Slinger. The Rose later changed his mind, so the continued existence of Spider-Man is not considered a blight on Puma's professional record.[8]\nPuma reached a state of \"harmonious enlightenment with the universe\" and was imbued with immeasurable power. However, doubting his own senses, Puma lost the mystical power just as he attacked the Beyonder. Puma sought Spider-Man's help when he discovered that he was destined to fight theBeyonder; Spider-Man refused, making Puma doubt himself and, eventually, fail in his quest against the Beyonder.[9]\nWhen the mutant powers ofCharles Little Sky, a kinsman of Fireheart's (and the man later known as Portal), first manifested, Fireheart tried to help his fellow tribesman better understand them.\nRejecting Fireheart's offers of aid, Portal fled toEllis Islandwhere Fireheart caught up to him. When Portal's powers activated again and returned theU-Foesto Earth, Fireheart teamed up with theAvengersas Puma to protect Little Sky, helping to defeat the villains.[10]\nPuma publicly confronted Spider-Man over a story in theDaily Buglethat made it seem as if Spider-Man was a thief; when the story turned out to be false, Puma felt as if he had lost face and was now honor-bound to clear Spider-Man's name.[11]To this end (and much to Spider-Man's annoyance), he purchased the Daily Bugle and began a campaign of positive promotion which was largely responsible for changing the public perception of Spider-Man to a hero.\nSeveral other heroes and allies of Spider-Man were involved in the accusation that Spidey was a thief. Puma and these heroes reunited as a group known as the Outlaws on several occasions.[12]\nDespite his honor bound defense of Spider-Man in the media, Puma personally despised the wall-crawler and being in his debt. This internal conflict eventually led to renewed hostilities between Parker and Fireheart, overseen by the mysteriousBlack Crow, leaving Puma broken as a man.[13]Puma's animal side became dominant after this contact with the Black Crow. He was seriously wounded in a fire fight with theNew York City Police, but nursed back to health byNocturne, who was eventually able to restore his human psyche.[14][15]\nPuma was seen in theBloodsportcompetition. He made it to the semi-final round, but was defeated byWolverine.[16]\nFireheart later teamed up with Spider-Man and theBlack Catto stopStegronfrom \"de-evolving\" the population of New York. After this Puma began a relationship with the Black Cat although he noticed Felicia may still have feelings for Peter Parker aka Spider-Man.[17]\nPuma has been seen at the bar with the other supervillains after the death of Stilt-Man. He has also been seen helping Black Cat from the sidelines. She has decided to help Peter Parker, who is on the run after the events of theCivil War. Together, Puma and Black Cat neutralize the drunken rampage of theRhino, mostly through sheer bluffing.[18]He became one of the trainees ofCamp Hammond.\nFireheart was later accused of federal bribery (which appeared to be a frame job) and his assets frozen; forbidden by his tribe from taking any contract kills, he had joinedMODOK's 11to get the cash he needs to defend himself in court. However, this meant disobeying the tribal council's order to remain on the reservation and so he had his puma powers stripped from him, leaving him a regular human right in the middle of their mission. When deciding to rescue theLiving Laser, who had earlier saved his life, he had an epiphany that defending one's own people is what the Puma Totem was meant to do, and he regained his powers in the process. Or so he thought — actuallyNightshadehad secretly injected him with \"werewolf serum\" designed to 'swap out' a previous form a person might have had imprinted on their DNA, such as Thomas' Puma form. Puma gained his cash fromM.O.D.O.K.and had taken up an offer from Nightshade to help his legal defense; any long term effects from the serum are unknown.[19]\nTransformation:Fireheart undergoes a physical transformation through intense concentration that includes an increase in his height and weight, his body becoming covered with a fine tan fur, and razor sharp fangs and claws. It also grants him superhuman physical attributes."

They have existed for centuries. In the 1400s and 1500s, many cities were built throughout Europe to act as \"spirit traps\", catching lost souls such as those that died a violent death that were unwilling to move onto the next world. Numerous fail-safes were made to both contain these spirits and keep intruders out. The cult lost influence over time and the cities were abandoned. Sorcerers of various abilities came and tried to deal with them but all failed, while the ghosts got restless.[1]\nYears ago, the Cult's leaderYagzanfound the remains ofJoseph Timms, aka the Glob. He determined that although the body was seemingly dead, Timms' brain had survived. Yagzan removed the brain, placed it in an enclosure, and brought it back to health. He also infused a portion of himself into the brain, forming a mental link with it so that he could control it in the future. Yagzan dubbed it \"the Golden Brain\".\nYagzan used the power of the brain to oppose the construction of the Omegaville energy project on behalf of his cult. However, the near-byMan-Thingsensed the anger of the men nearby, and was drawn into the conflict. A surprised Yagzan then used the brain's power to construct a golden-hued replica of Glob's body, which fought with Man-Thing, but was easily defeated. The exertion caused the Golden Brain to become so hot that Yagzan dropped it into the swamp. Freed, the Golden Brain tried to recall his lost memories. Still mostly amnesiac, the Golden Brain came back onto the land, and formed a new, human body for itself out of clay. 'Joe' as he now called himself later approached the Omegaville project, where he was hired as a worker. The cult later tracked the Glob down, and, horrified by his transformation back into a human form, Yagzan re-asserted his mental control to force Glob to devolve as much as possible. Now a mass of humanoid clay, Yagzan once again ordered Glob to destroy Omegaville. Again, the Glob was stopped by Man-Thing, who pummelled him into a shapeless mass of clay. Yagzan attempted to reform the creature, but he took advantage of his amorphous form and engulfed Yagzan completely before hardening back into his human form, suffocating him.[2]\nVictoriusregrouped the cult and, using theCosmic Cubein his possession, reformed the remains of Yagzaninto Jude, the Entropic Man, and together they started their new world order. This led to a conflict withthe Thing,Captain Americaand theMan-Thingin the swamp of theEverglades. Victorious and Jude were transformed into some sort of radiant crystal when they touched the Cosmic Cube while the Man-Thing was holding it.[3]\nYears later, the Cult of Entropy resurfaced, this time led by a man namedMahapralaya. In order to show their devotion to their cause, the cultists infected their own bodies with a variety of fatal viruses and diseases, giving them a jaundiced appearance similar to that of rotting corpses. Mahapralaya even acquired fresh recruits by way of his website www.putrescence.com. As his disciples began to grow, they met a being known as Mister Termineus who apprised them of the fact that theNexus of All Realitieshad been shattered and that such an incident threatened to destroy all reality. Mahapralaya knew that the Nexus' guardian the Man-Thing would be goaded into protecting the fragmented shards, so he set out to find the various pieces himself. He discovered that the Nexus fragments had housed themselves within human beings, one of which being Howard the Duck. Mahapralaya captured Howard and brought him into the Florida Everglades, the original site of the Nexus of All Realities. He believed that if he could destroy but one of the fragments, then the Nexus could never be restored, and thus his dreams of universal dissolution would come to fruition. However, the Man-Thing intervened, and intercepted the Nexus shard before Mahapralaya could acquire it. After which, the swamp creature turned his corrosive touch against the cult leader with unexpected results. Rather than burning Mahapralaya's face, The Man-Thing's powers, working in concert with the Nexus shard, actually healed his disease-ridden body, turning him into a normal person. Moments later, Mahapralaya staggers off into the swamp.[4]\nCult memberAndrew Forsonhad once worked with undercoverS.H.I.E.L.D.agentBobbi Morse. Creating a second personality in her, he used Morse to kill investigating S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, then to remove Victorius himself in order to take over the cult.[5]"

After the presumed death of his parents, Kraven was taken in by his grandfather, Vladimir, who happened to be a world-class spymaster, soldier, and big game hunter. Together they circled the world multiple times over as Vladimir trained the young Sergei to take revenge against the enemies of the Kravinoff family who hunted them and forced the Kravinoffs to flee.\nDecades later, with the Kravinoff family's enemies finally eliminated, Vladimir's hunt ended and he passed the mantle of Kraven the Hunter to Sergei, who resurfaced in the modern world at large with his orangutan manservantDoctorangutanto hunt in the new wartorn and adventurous world. Seeking to test his skills, Kraven made his skills available to the highest bidder, being involved in many world armies and spy organizations until he became a member of coffee magnate, billionaire industrialist, and weapons' manufacturerTony Stark's PMC,War Machine. During his service, Kraven gained a dubious and notorious reputation as a bloody hired gun for his involvement in destructive skirmishes both domestic and abroad and was often put in conflict withSHIELD. He also became uneasy allies with fellow hired gun,Frank Castle, and maintained a secret allegiance to him due to a secret blood debt between the two."

Castle was decorated with numerous medals for his active service in both Iraq and Afghanistan, including the Purple Heart which was awarded after he and fellow Marine Corpsman and future spouseMaria Wallswere the only deemed survivors of the campaign's deadliest firefight. The two married in a field hospital in the aftermath.\nWith his tour ending and his new spouse giving birth to children to support, Castle took a lucrative offer as a member of coffee magnate, billionaire industrialist, and weapons' manufacturerTony Stark's PMC,War Machine. During his service, Castle gained a dubious and notorious reputation as a bloody hired gun for his involvement in destructive skirmishes both domestic and abroad and was often put in conflict withS.H.I.E.L.D..\nAfter ending his service to Stark, Frank returned home and joined theNYPDafter having his first child, but became an aggressive workaholic and detached on the streets out of frustration over the docility of his domestic life. Castle soon became known for his excessive violence and proclivity for treating suspects like enemy soldiers, building a near-mythic reputation among the NYPD and NYC Organized Crime Syndicate as \"The Punisher\". Castle's notoriety reached its peak when he took down the \"Fancy Dan Gang\" and was promoted to Captain soon after the birth of his second child. Soon after his wife decided to take their children and leave him due to Castle's lack of involvement in their lives and obsession with violence, Frank took the job to replaceGeorge Stacyas the Captain of theSpecial Crimes Task Force, after Stacy was relieved of command bythe Mayor.[3]\nCastle was later seen brutally interrogating an arrestedAleksei Sytsevichfor information regardingSpider-Womanand who ordered him to kill George Stacy. Aleksei eventually revealed it was theKingpin.[4]Castle later interrogated Wilson Fisk while he was serving his solitary confinement sentence in prison, who denied having ordered the hit on Stacy or any connections to Spider-Woman, much to Castle's chagrin. Castle later ignored Stacy's advice to reconnect with his family and swore to hunt down the criminals under his watch.[1]\nAfter Spider-Woman was attacked byThe Vulture, Castle confronted a dazed Spider-Woman and engaged her in single combat. Castle struggled against Spider-Woman but overpowered her, before being surprised to learn she was just a young girl beneath the mask. During the confusion, Castle was knocked unconscious and greatly injured by Spider-Woman, now revealed as Gwen Stacy. Frank returned to the police precinct demanding the other officers return to work while covered in bandages much to the amazement of those present.[5]Frank continued his investigation to find the link between Spider-Woman, the Kingpin, and Captain Stacy before being attacked by ninjas of the Hand as ordered bythe new Kingpin.[3]Suspecting a connection, Castle began stalking the Stacys, determined to find the truth and confronted Gwen, accusing her of being Spider-Woman and tried to arrest her forcefully. Gwen managed to knock Castle unconscious using herRadioactive Spider Isotopes,[6]causing Castle to enlist the help of former PMC comradeKraven the Hunterin hunting Spider-Woman. Castle nearly captured proof of Spider-Woman's identity on camera with Kraven's help, but was stopped by George Stacy who knocked him unconscious and destroyed his evidence.[7]With Kraven's help, Castle managed to obtain a Spider-Isotope and attempted to use it to blackmailCEO Norman Osborninto helping him capture Spider-Woman in exchange for clearing his son's criminal reputation. Castle was confronted by DetectiveDeWolffwho pleaded that Castle stop his obsessive crusade, but was rebuffed.[8]\nCastle later confronted Spider-Woman again armed with a specialgauntlet, frantically attacking her while putting many bystanders in danger and destroying nearby buildings. Castle was temporarily stopped by George Stacy before managing to trap both Stacys, but was stopped again by the timely arrival of Detective DeWolff who admonished Castle for taking his pursuit of criminal justice to unacceptable extremes. Castle rebuffed DeWolff again and tried to shoot the Stacys, but ran out of ammunition and fled, becoming a fugitive of the law and criminal in his own right.[9]"

Deadpool kills the kidnapper driving the truck, but fails to notice in time that the truck is driving off of a cliff. The truck is temporarily stopped from its fall on a large protruding branch, but before Deadpool can get out a mysterious man with half of a face that looks like it is a statue repels down the cliff and snatches the pony from the truck. A shocked Deadpool falls with the truck down to the bottom of the cliff where it explodes, and Deadpool walks out of the wreckage, burned and disfigured (but alive because of his extraordinatry healing factor), griping about the botched job.\nDeadpool returns home to his New York apartment littered with overdue bills, and receives a call offering him a new mercenary job to kill a man named \"Jace Burns\". Deadpool accepts the job and makes his way down to theCaliforniaRedwoodswhere he hires a seductress to find out Jace's hotel room number in a high-class casino. After she completes her job, Deadpool surprises the woman by paying her in only a coupon to the casino's buffet, and he bounds off to set himself up for a sniper shot at Jace's hotel room.\nAn hour later, Jace arrives in his hotel room, but before Deadpool is able to pull the trigger on his sniper rifle to kill Jace, he is surprised by a quick gunshot fired by Jace himself that hits Deadpool right in the eye. A frustrated and surprised Deadpool tries to shoot Jace and then uses a vine hanging from the tree he is in to slide down into Jace's hotel room to try and kill him with a knife instead. Deadpool is yet again surprised to find that Jace is an adept combatant and has a high-tech wristwatch with many deadly gadets inside it to help him fight. Deadpool tears the wristwatch off of Jace's arm but foolishly presses random buttons, causing it to violently explode and blow up half of the treetop casino. Jace is killed in the explosion and Deadpool is rendered unconscious.\nDeadpool wakes up in an unknown medical room somewhere, with three individuals standing over him and telling him about his mission. Deadpool eventually realizes that they believe he is a badly burned and disfigured Jace Burns, and that they think the bones and ashes of the real Jace were those of his assassin. Deadpool decides to play into the deception and pretend he is Jace Burns.\nMeanwhile, somewhere else, a mysterious figure is informed that Jace Burns is still alive and plots another way to kill him."

DeadpoolCreators and AppearancesCreatorsMarv Wolfman,Jenny Blake Isabella,Dave CockrumFirstLegion of Monsters#1(August, 1975)\nChildren:\nIrises:\nThe creature known only as Manphibian was born on an unknown alien world over a thousand years ago. A member of his species attacked Manphibian, murdering his mate in the process. The alien fled from his home world, and Manphibian pursued him across several star systems in the hopes of exacting revenge. He eventually chased him to the planet Earth where both aliens found themselves trapped underground for a millennium.\nYears passed, and in that time an industrialist namedAaron Foxbuilt an oil refinery overtop the ground where the Manphibian laid buried. Persistent drilling in Shaft #27 awakened the two aliens, and they climbed their way to the surface. The rogue alien continued to satisfy his murderous ways and attackedBeth Fox, Aaron Fox's wife dragging her underwater. Manphibian battled his old adversary and rescued Beth, but the incident earned him the attention of Aaron Fox. Fox mobilized an attack helicopter and fired several missiles at the Manphibian. The missiles rained down destroying Shaft #27, and Manphibian was able to escape during the chaos. Manphibian was not the only creature to survive the carnage however. The alien who murdered his mate was still at large, and Manphibian spent the next several years scouring the Earth in search of him. It remains unknown whether he ever successfully satisfied his need for vengeance.[1]\nManphibian and his mate had multiple offsprings that were simultaneously trapped on Earth. Due to the death of his mate, Manphibian had to raise them on his own.\nAt some point, Manphibian was recruited byS.H.I.E.L.D.in order to be part ofNick Fury'sHowling Commandos. Manphibian was with the Howling Commandos when they launched an assault on the forces ofMerlin.[2]\nManphibian joined theLegion of Monstersin fightingHunter of Monster Special Force. During the war Manphibian's children were killed after being tortured byRobert Hellsgaard.\nManphibian was one of several beings (along with theAvengers Unity Division) captured byMojoto appear in one of Mojo's films. He was paired up with Blade, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, and Satana as theAvengers of the Supernatural.[3]\nThe Manphibian resurfaced a short time ago and was inducted into a S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Forces unit called theHowling Commandos(not to be confused with the originalHowling Commandosfrom World War II). The team was comprised of other powerful monsters including Warwolf, Vampire by Night, and the Living Mummy. As a member, the Manphibian participated in a mission to Afghanistan to stop the threat of a terrorist organization known as the Lords of the Living Lightning.[4]\nKnown Powers:It is believed that all of the Manphibian's powers are common to members of his race.[5]"

The LMDs were successful in waking Matrix, after subduing the Chameleon,Spider-Man,a future Deadpool, and their teammates. After battling the superheroes again, Matrix stated that he would wipe out humanity and replace them with LMDs before vanishing with the other LMDs. When Spider-Man andhis future selftried to relocate him, they found him at their parents' graves.\nMatrix had decided to not kill humanity and instead seek forgiveness as the Parkers had taught him, by aiding the heroes against the Chameleon, who arrived in aGalactus LMD, which was created as a countermeasure for Matrix byNick Fury. They were then joined byDeadpooland his future self in the battle and Matrix sacrificed himself in order to protect Deadpool. As the battle went on, the LMDs came and fixed their Master, then at his request they fused together in order to stop the Chameleon; however, even their combined efforts were not enough.

As Matrix tried to help his \"dads\" in fighting theWrecking Crew, they were transported to theSavage Landvia anAsgardianPortal Generatorused by the Wrecking Crew. After Matrix destroyed the Kill Switch that Spider-Man gave him as a sign of trust, Matrix created an artificial portal based on the Asgardian technology and helped Spider-Man, Deadpool, and theWarriors Threein defeating the Wrecking Crew. Realizing the threat that he posed, Matrix undid the troubles caused by Deadpool and willingly locked himself inArea 14beneathRolling Hills,New York. He also created a second Kill Switch and gave it to Bobbi in case of him becoming a threat. He assured his dads that he was going to be fine there and convinced them to take a road trip together in order to grow their bond.[5]\nAs Spider-Man and Deadpool were enjoying their trip, Matrix seemed to make the best of his situation, as he was seen throwing a party with the children guardian robots in Area 14.[6]He later accompanied Spider-Man and Deadpool in putting theManipulatorin jail.[7]\nRobot Body[11]\nLMD Hive Mind:Master Matrix is connected to the other Life-Model Decoys.[3]"

Little is known of his upbringing save for the fact that he was originally from Russia and immigrated to the United States at some point. During his life as crimelord, he came up against all sorts of opponents, such as thePolice, the masked superheroSpider-Man, and even against the media, withJohn Jonah Jamesonduring the 1980's. During his youth, he was nearly beaten to death, but a surgeon namedJonas Harrowsaved his life by inserting a steel plate in his skull, more precisely on his forehead. This gave him his trademark square-shaped skull, attaining the monikerHammerhead. The incident also left\nmental sequelae in Joseph, who became a homicidal maniac afterwards.\nAfter the decline of Maggia in the city, Hammerhead decided to become the sole leader of the mafia, formulating a plan to steal all the wealth and assets of other leaders of the organization. For this, he hiredFelicia Hardy, theBlack Catto steal data drives containing vital information about the other Mafia families involved with Maggia, which he would use to eliminate them completely. However, Felicia took advantage of this to try to steal all the wealth of Maggia for herself, and Hammerhead ordered her to be eliminated by bombing her apartment. Unbeknownst to him, Felicia managed to survive the attack, but disappeared soon after.\nWith the data drives being apparently destroyed when Felicia \"died\", Hammerhead changed the focus of the plan, now looking to to capture the other five Dons of Maggia to kill them while transmitting this to the whole city. This caused a massive gang war on the city, with all the other gangs fighting against Hammerhead and his goons, and also the police. Hammerhead also managed to steal equipment left bySilver Sable Internationalin the city after the crisis caused byMister Negativemonths before, using it to face the other gangs and authorities. The police eventually discovered that one of Hammerhead's gang operations was being held on the abandonedHarlem Sanatorium. Spider-Man alongCaptain Yuri Watanabewent there to disrupt the operation, but things went awry, with Yuri's police team being completely slaughtered by Hammerhead himself, and Yuri coming out as the sole survivor, thank's to Spider-Man's intervention. Hammerhead, knowing that he would eventually have to face Spider-Man himself, started to try to locate something called \"Project Olympus\", an advanced armor that was being made by Sable International. After discovering that the armor was being held at one of the city's police precincts, Hammerhead sent a group of his henchmen to distract Spider-Man while another group stole the armor, killing many other police officers on the process. This made Yuri vow revenge on Hammerhead, going alone to theBar with No Nameto try to find information on his wereabouts.\nIt wasn't too long until Hammerhead managed to finally capture all of the other four leaders, planning to cement them to the ground on a construction site. Fortunately, Spider-Man showed up, and managed to save all of the leaders. Enraged, Hammerhead, now using the Project Olympus armor, clashed against Spider-Man, who managed to defeat him. As he was being arrested by the police, Yuri showed up, shooting Hammerhead, apparently killing him. His body was later removed, being carried away by an expertise van. Unbeknownst to the officers on the van, Hammerhead was actually still alive, being reanimated by one of his henchmen, who was disguised inside the van.\nAfter being ressurected, Hammerhead went into hiding, planning to enhance even more the exoskeleton from Project Olympus, even going to the point of transfering his own head to a full enhanced cyborg body.\nHammerhead enhanced by the Project Olympus\nClashing against Silver Sable and Spider-Man"

Even during the Symkarian Civil War and when people began evacuating the village, his students still came to school. One morning when school started, nine soldiers broke into the school, armed with automatic rifles and wanted names. However, David wouldn't give into their demands. As their patience worn thin, they raised their guns to shoot David.\nSilver Sable came in and saved not only David's life, but the lives of his students, as well. Having been rescued by Sable, he began to work for Sable International since he owed her for saving his life. However, during the war in Symkaria, he resigned from Sable International to help deliver the humanitarian supplies to the refugees in Symkaria. When he resigned from Sable International, the work visa he had became invalid, which put him at high risk of being deported if someone were to check his ID. When he arrived in New York, Hammerhead's crew stole all of the supplies from the truck he was driving and attacked him. However, Spider-Man fought off the thugs and saved David. Later, Black Cat gave Spider-Man one of the last data drives that has all of the information on Hammerhead and when Spider-Man found out that there were locations of where the humanitarian supplies are, he went to each Olympus Hideout to recover the humanitarian supplies for David."

At some point during her early adulthood, her family's sovereignty over Symkaria was overtaken by a dictator, who established a totalitarian government in Symkaria. Due to this, the country fell into a bloody civil war, with Sable becoming one of the main helping hands of the rebel movement in the country, becoming the leader of theSilver Sable International, a company of guns-for-hire mercenaries founded by her grandfather, offering her services to anyone who paid well, using the money she raised to create her own technologies and weapons to help the rebels fight.\nAfter the terrorist attack caused byMister Negativeand theDemonsat theNew York City Hall, and their increasing threat to the city,Mayor Norman Osbornhired Sablinova and her mercenaries to help protect New York City, as the police couldn't handle the Demons alone. During one of her operations, Sable goes to investigate a business operated by the Demons, and ends up crossing paths withSpider-Man. Knowing that Spider-Man could disrupt her operations in the city, Sable proceeds to capture him, warning him to not cross her path again. It is only through the intervention ofYuri Watanabethat she permits him to walk away, warning him that if he ever gets on her way again, she would apprehend him for good. As the Demons actions become more violent over time, Sable increases vigil in the city by setting up several outposts on avenues and alleys, looking for potential citizens who may have been corrupted by the Demons. WhenDr. Morgan Michaelsbecomes the primary target by the Demons, due to him possessing the only existing sample of theDevil's Breath, Sable commands her team to escort him safely out of town, only for the escort team to be completely obliterated, and Dr. Michaels captured. This puts Sable on bad terms with Norman, who threatens to suspend her activities on the city.\nWeeks later, when the Devil's Breath was released on the city, Sable goes for a meeting with Norman Osborn on his private penthouse.Mary Jane Watsonused the opportunity to sneak into the location in order to uncover information from his secret lab. As MJ is investigatingHarry Osborn's bedroom, she overhears a conversation between Norman and Sable about theGR-27 Antidote, to which Norman himself wants to synthesize on a lab, with Sable wanting to escort him herself to the location, to which Norman replies that he would not be protected by her, due to her team failing on protecting the city. This enrages Sable, who goes to take a breath on the penthouse's balcony. This is when she hears noise coming from Norman's private lab, and goes to investigate, almost catching Mary Jane, who manages to run away soon afterwards. As Mary Jane is about to escape the penthouse, she is detected by one of Sable's mercenaries, and runs to another balcony. Sable tries to capture MJ, who becomes trapped. Sable tries to shoot her, forcing MJ to leap off the edge, just to be saved by Spider-Man.\nWhen Mister Negative kidnaps both Dr. Michaels and Norman, Sable goes to rescue both, crossing paths again with Spider-Man. The two strike a truce, as she can see that they are working toward a common goal, and she covers his back while he enters the lab. Later, Sable and her team help a badly injured Spider-Man by taking him for medical care atF.E.A.S.T.\nSable later calls Spider-Man to let him know she is leaving the country. Seeing him in action and helping those who hate him has caused her to reflect on her own purpose, although her agents stay in New York due to being paid by Mayor Osborn.\nMonths later,Hammerheaddiscovered and managed to acquire Sable tech left behind in New York after the Devil's Breath crisis, using it to arm his mafia and try to take over the city. Hammerhead also found something called \"Project Olympus\", a project made by Sable to create super soldiers using mechanical exoskeletons.\nUpon discovering that she had been stolen from, Sable returns to New York City looking to retrieve her stolen equipment, and kill Hammerhead. Spider-Man, who was also after Hammerhead at the time, tried to convince Sable to work alongside him to take down Hammerhead once and for all. Sable agrees, but unbeknownst to Spider-Man, she secretly puts a tracker on his suit so she can track him down as he discovers more about Hammerhead's whereabouts. She eventually discovers through Spider-Man that Hammerhead is planning to meet her at the top of the Colexco Building in Midtown. Enraged, Sable flies with her hoverjet to the location despite Spider-Man's warning that she could be in danger, but his efforts are in vain as Sable is caught on a trap orchestrated by Hammerhead. After fighting together against Hammerhead's goons, Hammerhead himself appears, but now completely transformed on a cyborg by the Project Olympus. Both Spider-Man and Sable clash against him on an epic battle over thePark Avenue, but they are no match for Hammerhead, who tries to kill Spider-Man by pushing him him against the hoverjet's engine. Suddenly,Black Catappears and saves Spider-Man by grabbing him away from the scene, leaving Sable alone to face Hammerhead. During the fight, the Hoverjet's engine fails, with the aircraft crashing on the ground below. Both Sable and Hammerhead survive the crash, but Sable is left unconscious, with Hammerhead using the opportunity to abduct her.\nSable later awakens in one of Hammerhead's hideouts somewhere in the city sewers. There, she is tortured by Hammerhead's goons with the goal to extract information about more of her guns and tech. She eventually is found and saved by Spider-Man, who managed to track her down. Once more, they agree to help each other against Hammerhead, but not only before they have to fight a horde of goons that were on the hideout. After that, Spider-Man reveals to Sable  a pen drive that Black Cat gave him earlier, that could contain important information on how to defeat Hammerhead once and for all. Upon browsing through the data on a nearby computer terminal, they discover that to defeat Hammerhead, they would need to melt down his steel forehead with massive heat. Together, they go to Sable's secret New York base on the Hudson River where she claims to have the necessary apparatus to defeat Hammerhead. Arriving there, Spider-Man helps Sable to set a powerful laser on one of her hoverjets, so they can use it to melt Hammerhead's forehead, but are interrupt by the same. A fight ensues, with Spider-Man fighting him on the ground while Sable uses the laser directly on his forehead. After a long fight, Sable manages to defeat Hammerhead by crashing her hoverjet directly on him. She then says farewell to Spider-Man, thanking him for helping her, and that without his aid, she wouldn't be able to help her people back in Symkaria. As she is about to depart, she gives Spider-Man a ride to back toManhattan.\nSable later returns to Symkaria with her retrieved tech to help the rebels.[1]"

Her education as a warrior was completed when she became a member of the group of ninja assassins called theHand. While in college, Elektra metMatt Murdock, who eventually became the vigilante heroDaredevil. Matt fell in love with Elektra, but the two eventually went their separate ways.[1]\nThey were reunited when Elektra, now a professional killer, was hired byKingpinto murder Matt's partnerFoggy Nelson. Matt managed to awaken the love the two had once shared, and Elektra was unable to kill Nelson. As punishment for failing her mission, Kingpin hiredBullseyeto assassinate her. Elektra had briefly replaced Bullseye as the Kingpin's chief assassin, leading the deranged killer to develop an obsession with killing her.[1]\nBullseye seemingly succeeded in murdering Elektra, but using her Hand training, she had thrown her soul into the body of an innocent dancer, who had witnessed the murder. Elektra dwelt in this stolen body for some time, until her original body was resurrected by the Hand. A year after the resurrection of her body, she reversed the effects of the soul-swap, restoring her original body. She returned to Matt, but the two would soon become the objects of Bullseye's mania once again.[1]\nAfter years of fighting and trying to avoid their enemies, both Matt and Elektra grew tired of being constant tragets. She taught Matt the soul-swap technique she had learned from the Hand, and Matt used it to swap bodies with Bullseye, before the pair killed him, making it appear as if Daredevil had died. With their greatest foe gone, the two left their old lives behind and lived in peace. At some point, the two lovers died and found themselves in theRealm of the Dead. There they would live out their afterlives in constant combat with other superhumans.[1]\nWhenMar-Vellmanaged to killDeathand create hisParadise, Elektra was offered the opportunity to leave the Realm of Death behind. Elektra, however, refused and chose to live her afterlife as one of theKingpin's assassins, alongside Bullseye.[1]"

Electra decided not to rekindle her romance with Scaredevil, but they remained in good terms.[1]\nFor unrelated reasons, Scaredevil suffered a very bad losing streak, but he overcame it and he decided to give a party for his closest friends, including Electra, in which they would be served Scaredevil's traditional chicken cacciatore -which was tempting for several guests including Electra. At that point, Electra was dating supervillainElektroand she insisted in bringing him with her to the party. Scaredevil begrudgingly agreed, wanting to believe that Electra and Elektro simply liked saying each other's name out loud.[1]\nDuring the dinner, Scaredevil revealed that he had delegated cooking tasks to local youth organizationLard Boys, which appaled Electra, Elektro and several of the other guests. Electra and Elektro indeed were surprised when they found marshmallows in their soup. Even worse:Sluggerof Lard Boys had accidentally replaced antipasto with ant paste, and used red paint in the chicken. However, Scaredevil's enemyKingkinginterrupted the party uninvited and gruesomely ate all the contamined food, disgusting Electra and the other guests. Scaredevil felt into a depression and Electra joined other friends (Gloriosky O. Finyan,Froggy NeilsenandMelvin Scmotter) in an attempt to pat him up. The Lard Boys revealed that the food had been spoiled, which caused Kingking to suffer from digestion problems, and cheered up Scaredevil. Kingking's dietist Mr.Simmons, a disembodied head, joined the party explaining that he had tried to convince Kingking to not go there, and offered his own restaurant so that the guests could have dinner. When he made a pun about being theheadwaiter, Electra and other guests (Scaredevil, Finyan, Neilsen, Scmotter andGlenn Youritfelt to the floor).[1]"

A chance meeting with Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, on the streets of Hell's Kitchen, sparked a romance for which neither was prepared. Their budding relationship was torn asunder when Nikolas, who worked for the crime lord Kingpin, was assassinated by Kingpin's hired killer, Bullseye. Elektra mistakenly believed Daredevil to be responsible, and she pledged to exact vengeance on the Man Without Fear.\nIt seems that after some time their issues were resolved and Elektra threw away her vendetta. However, later she was gassed and brainwashed by Kingpin and forced to battle Matt once again. She was beaten by Daredevil and regained control of herself.[2]"

Orestez was shamed to learn that not only was his father caught in the assassination attempt, but his baby sister was saved from their dying mother's womb and confirmed to be Hugo's child as well.

How this is possible is the mystery. Richard explains.\nBack at Oscorp, Mary Jane is sitting in a chair (the same chair that turned Norman Osborn into the Green Goblin). The monstrous insane Peter Parker clone is about to perform a test on Mary Jane, a test that will transform Mary Jane into something that Peter won't have to always worry about protecting. Before he can start the test, he is kicked in the face, by a man in a black suit with a spider across the chest and stomach area, and with six arms.\nBack at the home: Richard is explaining how he is alive... After creating thecure for cancer, later known asVenom, Richard was disgusted that he created such a monster, but his bosses liked what they had. Richard, Eddie Brock Sr., and Mary Parker, signed a deal to sell thesuitto Trask Industries, and to make a lot of money out of it. Richard, had second thoughts about it though, and was considering not going on the plane to Chicago. He was the only one who thought this, so everyone else went on the plane. The plane eventually crashed, killing everyone. That is how Richard was still alive.\nAt Oscorp, the fight between the deformed Peter and the Spider-man with six arms rages on. The six-armed Spider-man is able to get the upper hand for a while, but the deformed Peter soon is able to beat down his opponent. After knocking him unconscious, he is able to continue his experiment on Mary Jane.\nBack at home: Richard explains that he worked for CIA since. The CIA figured out that Richard's death was not accidental. Even though Richard did not die, everyone still thinks that. The CIA asked Richard to help him with their plan to take down Bolivar Trask, the man they believe to be the one who organized the death. Richard always kept an eye out for his son, but could never talk to him or let him know he was alive, or else S.H.I.E.L.D. would eventually find out also, and would compromise the mission.\nBefore Richard could explain how Gwen is alive, bright lights swarm the house. Outside is Nick Fury, along with dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. troops and huge Spider Slayers. No one in the house knows what is going on. Gwen is becoming impatient. Richard tries desperately to calm her down, as he has been doing for the past half an hour. Unfortunately, this time it isn't working, and the end result is Gwen's transformation... Into Carnage.\nCarnage crashes out the house. Aunt May falls to the ground holding her heart.\nBack at Oscorp, the deformed Peter has successfully transformed Mary Jane..."

Following a fight with the madmanGladiator, Peter went to Conners's lab for medical treatment. Conners helped him, and after Spider-Man departed, he examined Peter's blood out of curiosity.[5]\nBirth of \"Little Ben\"\nIntrigued by what he had found, Conners wanted to try to use Peter's DNA to create something new. With the help of his lab assistantBen Reilly, Connors used a leftover sample ofRichard Parker's research - theVenom symbiote- to combine the sample of Peter's DNA with his own - which had been altered by theLizard Serum. After a month of experimentation, Connors and Reilly succeeded in creating a red-and-black symbiote that they divided into several samples, placing all but one into storage.[6][7]The symbiote rapidly gestated into a fetus-like creature nicknamed \"Little Ben\", which quickly escaped and began consuming others to sustain itself, metamorphosing into a red-and-black humanoid monster closely resembling Venom.[6]\nGwen's death at the hands of the Carnage Symbiote\nPossessing fragments of Peter's memories, the Carnage symbiote made its way to theParker residenceinQueens, where it found and fed onGwen Stacy, killing her.[8]In the resulting fight with Peter, the symbiote partially transformed into a replica of Richard Parker before degenerating back into a monster, causing Peter to theorize that it needed to absorb his DNA to become complete. The Carnage symbiote was seemingly destroyed when thrown into an industrial chimney.[9]However, following Dr. Connors' arrest, Reilly snuck back into the lab and stole one of the additional samples.[7]\nAt the behest of theCIA, Ben Reilly began working alongsideOtto Octaviuson creating super-soldier clones - mostly of Spider-Man. As part of an experiment called \"The Stacy Project,\" Reilly and Octavius infused the sample of the Carnage Symbiote with Gwen Stacy's genetic material, gestatinga molecular duplicatewho possessed all of the original Gwen's memories up to and including her death.[4]Afraid of the Carnage symbiote and unable to fully control it, the clone of Gwen panicked and escaped custody alongside the other clones.[10]\nCarnage possessed various superhuman attributes as a result being a combination of Peter Parker's DNA, Curt Connors's DNA, and a sample of theVenom Suit. Most of its powers are similar to those that Spider-Man and Venom possess, though a few are more developed. Carnage issuperhumanly strong, though it is unknown how much it can lift. It needs to feed on humans to survive, due to its damaged DNA. Much like Venom, it cancreatetentaclesfrom its biomass, which it can use toweb-swingin a manner similar to Spider-Man's webs. It can also use these as weapons, whipping them around or sharpening them to impale enemies like spears; even creating giant projections through the ground.\nShapeshifting:Because of its physical and mental instability, Carnage's appearance is subject to the creature's emotions. It gained the appearance of numerous individual beings, such a malformed human, theLizard(when killing a couple in the alley), theVenom symbiote(the form it used most),Peter Parker(when killing Gwen Stacy), andRichard Parker(when confronting Peter Parker)."

After their family was overwhelmed and their kingdom had fallen, Shiklah's father was distraught over the seeming deaths of his sons,AmjadandBaqir, so he decided to seal her away in a sarcophagus until the war ran its course, or until she was to be wed.[4]\nDeadpoolwas hired byDraculato bring Shiklah to him so he could marry her, in order to take over her old lands, unite the monster world under his rule, and end a long feud. After traveling tothe Arabian Peninsula, Deadpool made a timely rescue of Shiklah's sarcophagus before a faction of teleporting monsters managed to destroy it.[5]Deadpool then brought the coffin toGreeceand got into a fight with theMinotaur, where the coffin shattered and Shiklah was awakened along with her petdragon,Bug.[1]\nShiklah's monster form\nShiklah repaid Deadpool's services by attempting to absorb his life force by kissing him, but failed due to Deadpool's healing factor. Shiklah then followed Deadpool out of Greece by hopping a train toParis, but they were intercepted byBladewho was trying to convince Deadpool that Shiklah was a monster, and Deadpool should give her up.[4]They fought, and Shiklah, in her monster form, helped Deadpool to defeat Blade, since they had grown close.[6]\nAfter Deadpool arranged transportation across theAtlanticby calling his friendBob, the pair decided to see Paris and visited the Catacombs. After Shiklah saved Deadpool from being possessed by a Templar ghost, she admitted having feelings for him. Deadpool pushed away her advances due to his worry that things would turn disastrous just like all of his past relationships.[7]\nAfter leaving the Catacombs, the pair was captured byHydra, who wanted to exploit Shiklah's power. They soon escaped the frying pan into the fire, as the Hydra vessel was intercepted byA.I.M..[7]Shiklah proved herself by fighting and defeating the A.I.M. agents and a large robot, but was captured byM.O.D.O.K.. Deadpool then defeated M.O.D.O.K. and saved Shiklah from being abducted.[3]\nOnce Shiklah and Deadpool returned toNew York City, they got married in a ceremony officiated byNightcrawler.[8]Shiklah also used a vast amount of her time in the present to catch up with the culture of the world,[9]while still ruling overMonster Metropolis.[8]\nShiklah began treating Wade with more disdain the more time that they spent apart due to his negligence, prompting her to find different lovers that could satisfy her when Wade didn't.[10]Deadpool's preference for the world on the surface fueled Shiklah's disdain towards humanity, eventually feeling that monsterkind had cowered underground for too long.\nThe breaking point for Shiklah was the death of her subjectFarcus, a centuries-old senile monster who was killed by bystanders after wandering off Monster Metropolis. For the sake of the safety of her people, Shiklah used the power of theScepter of the Manticoreto mobilize armies from her kingdom and other places with the intention to annex Manhattan to Monster Metropolis.[11]\nSuccubus Physiology:As a succubus, Shiklah has a great deal of power at her disposal, and with this power usually comes boosted strength, durability, regeneration, speed, supernatural level of beauty and some magical abilities, especially dealing with illusions and mental manipulation. Physical changes include fangs, claws, pointed tail and wings. Though with her being the Queen of the succubus' she might possess even greater potential for those abilities. Displayed powers so far:"

Iron Man: Demon in an Armor#1(December, 2010)What If? Dark Reign#1(December, 2010)\nIn the 1980s, Wade Wilson, as Deadpool, was hired byGalactusto kill theBeyonderin retaliation for mergingM.O.D.O.K.to Galactus's rear end in exchange for the Continuity Cube. Armed with the Recton Expungifier, the only weapon which could kill the Beyonder, Wilson traced his target to a nightclub and was subsequently enticed into the Beyonder's partying lifestyle - and in the process gained Jheri curls.[citation needed]\nWhile hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine,Spider-Manbroke into the car and demanded the Beyonder remove theSymbiote costumefrom him. Spider-Man was then shot out of the limousine by Beyonder's driver and singerBobby Oceanic. The Symbiote departed Peter Parker's body and merged with Wilson, and the two became \"Venompool\".[citation needed]\nAfter years of partying, the Beyonder grew tired of all the fun, and returned Venompool to the world. Venompool was snapped out of Beyonder's magic and tried to resume his contract to kill Beyonder, but then realized he had pawned the Recton Expungifier. Venompool got himself clean by kidnapping and selling a drunkenTony StarktoA.I.M.. He used his money to start his life over until he finally spent all his money away and deciding to become a real hero. Unfortunately, Venompool couldn't apply to become a member to any famous superhero teams such as theFantastic Four, theAvengers, or theDefendersdue to possessing the now unpopular Jheri curls. Knowing what he had to do, Venompool tried to remove his Jheri curls by using a bell tower. The ringing of the bells freed him from the Jheri curls.[citation needed]\nDespite being rid of the Jheri curls, Venompool's actions as a \"hero\", the slaughtering of small time crooks, only left mindless violence in his wake. Venompool was once again looked down and frowned upon by society. Venompool was advised by a passing police officer to entering theSecret Wars, a series of fights between heroes and underdeveloped villains, in order to boost his recognition. Venompool was criticized by theSentry, one of the contenders, for not \"getting\" superheroes. He then left the Secret Wars to find another way to be significant.[citation needed]\nVenompool went back to where he pawned the Recton Expungifier and bought the gun back to resume killing the Beyonder. He then made a fake phone call and told Beyonder that he was throwing a gala event celebrating the Beyonder's life in his apartment. Beyonder agreed to make an appearance and Venompool waited for his arrival. The Beyonder arrived with Venompool's archnemesis,Carnage Curl, a female offshoot of his symbiote-sentient Jheri curls. Venompool engaged Carnage Curl and Beyonder on theHairy Sprangertalk show. During the show, Venompool learned to his shock that Carnage Curl was pregnant which led to a surprise guest from Galactus who revealed that he was responsible for impregnating Carnage Curl and then began to fight with Beyonder, causing Earth to be destroyed. Venompool, however, survived and having enough of Galactus and Beyonder, erased them from existence with the Recton Expungifier and saving the Earth.[citation needed]\nVenompool was hailed as a hero and gained the recognition he deserved. Although he had become very relevant, he felt that something was still missing. While being interviewed during the premiere of his movie, he noticedThorwas gaining admiration. This made Venompool realize that other people were also being admired so he decided to wipe out anyone who was appreciated for their heroic deeds. Over the next year, Venompool killed every hero and villain, leaving only the more attractive ones alive for adoration purposes. He became the world's only, and thus most important, superhero. He was covered exclusively by the media and his adventures were more significant than any hero's had ever been. Everything he did had a ripple effect in the world where he really, really mattered. Unfortunately, he didn't handle the success with grace. Instead, it was an opportunity to decry all those who opposed him along the way to becoming king of the world. He soon gave in to his own ego, fueled by his long past rejection, and a desperate insecurity that no success could quell. But still, with all the power he had, he realized he was empty and nothing made him feel like the success he worked so hard to achieve.[citation needed]"

Diagnosed with inoperable cancer, he underwentan experimental treatmentthat gave him superhuman regenerative abilities but caused the cancer to consume his entire body. Wade took on the costumed identity Deadpool, but when Vanessa was killed he was unable to save her and went insane from grief.[2]For a time, Deadpool was an infamously ruthless assassin, but mellowed into a still-violent but wisecracking antihero who used fourth-wall breaking humor as an outlet for his grief.[3][2]\nAt some point, Deadpool used a time machine to travel to feudal Japan, where he fought a samurai.[4]Some time later, Deadpool was invited to Tokyo by the Japanese multimedia corporation Shueisha, publisher of theShōnen Jumpmanga magazines. After foiling a terrorist organization's attempts to create a super-soldier serum, Deadpool was bribed into join theSamurai Squad- a new superhero team bankrolled by theAvengers- byIron Man.[5]Encountering the superheroSakura Spider- another recruit to the Samurai Squad, Deadpool mocked her for being a ripoff ofSpider-Man; though they worked together to foil a hostage situation.[1]Immediately afterwards, they were confronted byLoki, who offered Deadpool a spot on a supervillain team he was putting together. Deadpool refused and informed Loki the Avengers were en-route - Deadpool having RSVP'd them to a party celebrating the launch of theDeadpool: Samuraimanga - causing the god of lies to retreat. To Deadpool's dismay, however, the only Avenger to arrive wasCaptain America, who tasked them with finding new recruits for the Samurai Squad.\nDeadpool and Sakura Spider were sent to recruitNeiro Aratabi, a teenage idol singer who was the host of asymbioteshe'd nicknamedKage.[3]Attending one of Neiro's concerts, Deadpool teasingly accused Sakura Spider of having a crush on the idol. While attempting to sneak into the dressing room, Deadpool and Sakura Spider were accosted by security guards and chased outside, spotting Neiro being attacked by Loki. Spider Sakura used her webbing to launch Deadpool through the window, Deadpool tackling Loki in an attempt to disrupt his attempt to brainwash Neiro.[6]\nAttacked by the brainwashed Neiro, Deadpool was disgusted by Loki's accomplice, an obeseotakuwho had sided with the Asgardian when promised to have Neiro as a sex slave.[7]Deadpool managed to break Loki's control over Neiro and was disturbed when she asked him not to kill theotaku- who she said she forgave because he was one of her fans. Despite agreeing not to kill theotaku, Deadpool did so anyway when Sakura Spider arrived and recognized theotakuas a ticket-scalper.[8]AfterBruce Bannerremoved the control collar from Neiro, Deadpool annoyed him into Hulking out and was smashed into a bloody pulp.[9]Informed that Loki was after a machine that could create multiversal and even omniversal portals, Deadpool and the other Samurai Squad members were tasked with protecting it. A squad of Hydra insurgents brainwashed by attacked and were quickly subdued and/or slaughtered, the leader revealing that Loki had resurrectedThanosimmediately before the Mad Titan attacked, incapacitating Deadpool.[9]\nWith both the Hulk and Neiro effortlessly incapacitated by Thanos,[10]Neiro's symbiote bonded to Deadpool in a bid to increase their odds. However, even with the symbiote augmenting him Deadpool was easily defeated and it returned to Neiro. Deadpool attempted to contactCaptain Marvelbut accidentally summonedAll-Mightinstead. Deadpool was angered by All-Might defeating Thanos by himself, the villain destroying the interdimensional portal device with one last attack before succumbing to his wounds.[11]\nWith Loki rallying his army of supervillains on Mt. Fuji, Samurai Squad returned to base to resupply before the final battle. However, to Deadpool's annoyance, Neiro abruptly left after being notified that she had an upcoming concert, declaring she cared more about pleasing her fans than the fate of Japan. Distracted by thinking about how her opinion of him had changed, Sakura Spider was run over by a truck and a car, leaving her severely injured.[2]Forced to face Loki's army alone, Deadpool killed an avatar ofShuma-Gorathwith a super hero landing, but was easily defeated until several members of the Avengers arrived, having been called in by Sakura Spider.[12]Loki fled into Aokigahara Forest and opened a portal, attempting to summon a variant ofWeapon XI,[13]but he was killed by the villainousDeadpoolfromEarth-617, who Loki had previously hired. Deadpool-346 and Deadpool-617 fought, the latter attempting to kill him via impalement on a tree stump a laLogan, but Deadpool-346 convinced his counterpart to change sides by revealing that Iron Man paid better than Loki.[14]The two Deadpools defeated Loki, who revealed that the reason he wanted to destroy Japan was becauseThorhad stopped participating in their centuries-long rivalry due to becoming addicted to anime. As the Avengers arrested him, Loki declared that the villains of the world would rise up to complete his mission; Deadpool voicing confidence in the Samurai Squad's ability to take them down.[15]"

Throughout the Cosmic Brick crisis, Deadpool could frequently be seen in locations the various heroes visited, but never helped them in any way.\nDue to his awareness as a fictional character, Deadpool provided commentary for the game's bonus missions. he provided his own brand of irreverent commentary, summarising the opening and closing events of the mission and often talking to the player directly, encouraging them to find his red bricks and being disappointed at them unlocking any character that wasn't him. Deadpool would occasionally show up in the events themselves but, once again, never actually helped the heroes.\nAfter all his Red Bricks were unlocked, Deadpool challenged the player to a race as yet another step to 100% completion. Once the player had defeated Deadpool, he gifted them his bike as a reward.\nTasking the player with a fetch quest, Deadpool requested them to find his Flamingo blade. The player eventually found it, but was annoyed that the player most likely followed the convenient trail of studs."

Throughout his ordeal, Wilson bore the punishment which ultimately broke his sanity (or in Wilson's belief, becoming the \"real me\"). Near the end of his torture, he was left hanging on thumb-holds to drown after long refusing to cooperate with his torturer. But he escaped and killed his torturer in his sleep with his swords, stealing the mask and weapons he now uses. When asked by his psychologist as to how he escaped, Wilson revealed that he had eaten his thumbs, removing one of his prosthetic thumbs."

He joined theUnited StatesSpecial Forcesand made forty-one confirmed kills before he was dishonorably discharged, leading him to then become a mercenary. Working out ofSister Margaret's School for Wayward GirlsinNew York City, he befriended their bartender,Weasel.[2]\nWade meets Vanessa\nEventually, Wade met and fell in love withVanessa Carlysle, later proposing to her. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with a late-stage terminal cancer shortly after, putting a crimp in his wedding plans, and devastating both him and his new fiancee. He was then approached bya representativeof theWeapon Xprogram, who offered him a cure for his condition as well as superhuman abilities.\nExperimented on by Ajax\nWade agreed and was taken to a facility run by a cruel scientist calledAjax, who was attempting to create an army ofmutatesunder his control. He put Wade through various torturous experiments to try and activate his dormant mutant gene, which took their toll on Wade's mind, making him more deranged than before and even causing him to hallucinate, eventually discovering his status as a fictional character. After several days, Ajax succeeded in activating his power of regeneration, which horribly disfigured Wade physically. Furious, Wade broke free and battled Ajax, destroying the facility in the process, and lost track of Ajax in the battle.[2]\nDeadpool meets Colossus\nAfraid to confront Vanessa in his current appearance, Wade took on the moniker \"Deadpool\", after remembering when Weasel bet in the Sister Margaret's group \"dead pool\" that he would die, and began hunting for Ajax to force him to fix his face. He eventually tracked him down, though his attempt to kill him was interrupted by theX-MenmembersColossusandNegasonic Teenage Warhead. Colossus attempted to convince Deadpool to be a hero and join them, but he declined and escaped their apprehension of him.\nFinal battle with Ajax\nShortly after, Ajax targeted and kidnapped Vanessa to get back at Wade, hoping to lure him out and kill him for good. Upon learning of this, Deadpool contacted Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead for their assistance, and the three confronted Ajax and his men in an explosive battle. Deadpool managed to save Vanessa and, despite Colossus' pleas to spare him, kill Ajax. Despite his appearance, Vanessa still accepted Wade, and the couple resumed their relationship, with Deadpool becoming an international mercenary-for-hire.[2][5]\nIn 2018, on his anniversary with Vanessa, Deadpool was targeting criminalSergei Valishnikov, planning to kill him before heading home to his fiancée. Sergei hid in his compound's panic room while Deadpool killed the rest of his men, and once Deadpool realized he couldn't break in, he decided to let him go for the time being to go home and spend time with Vanessa.\nA time-traveling Wade, now with his memories of the aborted timeline\nUnfortunately, Sergei and his men retaliated by attacking Wade and Vanessa at their apartment. In theoriginal version of events,SergeikilledVanessaand leftWadein a deep depression. However, after doing some soul-searching, he acquired a time-traveling wristband that allowed him to travel back to the moment before Vanessa's death, his consciousness traveling into the body of his younger self, and giving this Wade the memories of his experiences in that timeline. He saved her and kill Sergei instead, and, with his new memories, went off to time travel further, altering events he assessed as needing to be \"cleaned up\" across their universe's history.\nIn his time-traveling exploits, he saved his friendPeter Wisdom, who had died in the previous timeline, killing actorRyan Reynoldsbefore he could make the universally despised filmGreen Lantern, and more.[5]\nWade begs Happy Hogan for a spot on the Avengers\nWade eventually learned how to use the wristband to travel across themultiverse, and eventually made his way to the \"Sacred Timeline\", where he applied for a job as a member of theAvengers, hoping to make up for what he perceived as Vanessa's disappointment in him for not saving her in the aborted timeline. He was turned down byHappy Hoganon behalf of the Avengers, who at this point remained in a state of flux following theirinternal dissolution, and went back to his universe ashamed, where he promptly demolished the wristband. Soon after, he broke up with Vanessa but remained friends with her, moved in with his friendBlind Al, and retired from the mercenary business to work atDrive Maxalongside Peter.[1]\nSix years after his journey through the multiverse, Wade was captured by a faction of theTime Variance Authority, the multiverse's regulators, and was informed by their leader,Mr. Paradox, that he was to be transferred permanently to the Sacred Timeline and become an Avenger. However, after he suited up as Deadpool once again, he learned his timeline,Earth-10005, was decaying from the death of its \"anchor being\", themutantheroWolverine, five years inthe future, and so Mr. Paradox planned to speed up the process by destroying it with aTime Ripper.\nRecruiting the Wolverine variant\nDesperate to save his universe and finally do something meaningful, Deadpool escaped the TVA's headquarters with one of their remotes to try and find the Wolverine. He time-traveled to some point after 2029 to dig up Wolverine's body, in hopes of his regeneration reviving him. After confirming that his Wolverine was irreversibly dead, he searched several different timelines for a Wolverinevariantto take his place, and finally located a disgracedvariant of Loganwho seemed very similar to his own. He brought the reluctant Logan to the TVA's headquarters, but the idea that he could replace his anchor being was laughed off by Paradox, and the pair was banished to theVoid.\nArriving there, Deadpool tried to convince Wolverine to help him save his home, and the two fought before they were captured by a group of mutants who brought them to the ruler of the Void, the telekinetic mutantCassandra Nova. She taunted them with the prospect of a way home, but they escaped and made their way on a journey across the Void to find another way out. Along the way, Logan and Wade continued to fight and argue, and eventually came across theResistance, a group of superhero variants who had managed to survive the Void outside of Cassandra's reign, includingLaura, the daughter of Logan fromthe possible future where he died. Deadpool convinced them that they had a chance against Cassandra if they used theJuggernaut's helmet to block her abilities.\nWolverine and Deadpool escape the Void\nThe six of them launched an assault on Cassandra's lair, however, said assault left Deadpool incapacitated while she entered Wolverine's mind in order to bring him to her ranks. Fortunately, this distracted her long enough for Deadpool to place the helmet over her head. They agreed to spare her life in exchange for a way out of the Void and Cassandra followed her word, using aSling Ringto get the two of them back into Deadpool's Universe. Over there, Paradox was about to use a Time Ripper to destroy this reality, but his plan was hijacked by Cassandra Nova, who decided to destroy every reality and leave only the Void for herself to rule over. Cassandra also brought over her version of the Deadpool Corps to stop Wolverine and Deadpool from interfering with her plan. Deadpool and Wolverine tore through the Corps, only for them to regenerate and get back up immediately. They were however persuaded to stay back by the arrival of Deadpool's friendPeter.\nWolverine and Deadpool rushed to stop Cassandra Nova from using the Time Ripper, and Paradox warned them that short-circuiting it would surely lead to a certain death. Wolverine volunteered to do it, but was blindsided by Deadpool who wished do it himself. He was unable to reach both energy beams however, and so Wolverine joined him in sharing the energy together, which allowed them to survive it. Cassandra Nova was disintegrated by Time Ripper's energy, while Paradox was apprehended byB-15who confirmed that Deadpool's timeline was now stable, but also that the TVA was unable to change the past of Wolverine's reality. Wolverine decided to stay at Deadpool's reality and they both joined a celebration at Wade's apartment with his friends, includingX-23whom TVA managed to pull out of the Void. During said party, Wolverine encouraged Wade to reconcile with Vanessa.[1]\nDeadpool returned at the TVA, where he started being tired of people still blaming him for the Human Torch's death, to which he showed footage of a recording that was filmed from a surveillance camera in the cage that him, Wolverine and Johnny Storm was in, proving that he was indeed bad-mouthing Cassandra Nova that led him to his death. Being satisfied to clear his name, Deadpool said \"Gotcha f%&k-face!\"[1]\nBio-Augmentation:Deadpool's powers come from the experimentation he was submitted to by an unknown organization.\nCable's Time-Traveling Device:Deadpool briefly used the time-traveling wristband used byCableto traverse universes and time.[5]However after he was done traversing, changing timelines and not being accepted into theAvengers, he quickly destroyed it.[1]"

His history most likely mirrors that of his Earth-616 counterpart. Like many other incarnations, he is well aware that he is just a character in fiction. As such, he frequently breaks the fourth wall to address the audience, like complaining to the writing staff about the plot of the episode, demanding less screen time for the Avengers' partners and more for the heroes, and trying to take over the eyecatch segments at the start and end of each commercial break.\nIn his debute episode, Deadpool attacks a villain joint in Mexico and stealsIron Fist'DISK fromKing Cobra. He takes the DISK to the Avengers, where he tries to trade it for leadership of the team. The Avengers refuse however, even after Deadpool leads the team in a victorious fight with theSerpent Society. Deadpool thus keeps the DISK for himself. When he retreats to a rooftop to lament being turned down, he is confronted byTiger Shark. Empowered by theDimension Sphere, Tiger Shark is too strong for Deadpool to handle and even threatens to D-Secure Deadpool in a DISK; something that clearly terrifies him. It's only due to the intervention of the Avengers andRed Skullthat Deadpool is spared this fate. He then slips away from the group, with Iron Fist's DISK still in his possession.[1]"

After suffering defeat at the hands of the Titan, and unable to save her father, Deathpool went in pursuit of Thanos as she travelled from reality to reality to kill the Deadpools from all dimensions in his quest for revenge.\nDeathpool was \"born\" from the essence of Death, with the cosmic entity disappearing when her \"daughter\" was born. Incarnated fully formed, and with a scythe, she was educated by Deadpool in combat and her responsibilities as the representation of the concept of death, of which he knew little about. Together with her \"father\", Deathpool fought space-pirates and killer robots, and eventually went her separate ways from Deadpool, acting as the avatar of the Dead, only occasionally meeting with her father. Three years into her tenure as Death, Deathpool visited her father to witness Thanos kill her seemingly unkillable father with the power of the Infinity Gems, \"snapping\" him into dust.\nDeathpool confronted Thanos but was beaten. The Mad Titan, meanwhile resolved a new goal: to kill all the Deadpools in the multiverse, blaming Deadpool for the \"death\" of his beloved Death. Deathpool followed Thanos in an effort to save the Deadpools of other dimensions, as well as her main goal: to kill the Mad Titan for killing her father. Deathpool pursued him through various dimensions, always one step behind Thanos as he killed multiple Deadpools, until confronting him in a dimension whose Deadpool had become a monk and was attempting to achieve enlightenment. Too late to save this Deadpool, Deathpool still managed to attack Thanos'Infinity Gauntletwith her scythe, interfering with theSpace Stone, causing her to accidentally end up inNexus Earth, sometime after the fall ofUltimus. There she encounteredthis dimension's Deadpool, working forS.T.R.I.K.E., for once being ahead of the Mad Titan.\nWarning him of the incoming threat, Deathpool resolved to herself to follow Deadpool and use him as bait to draw out Thanos, and went on several missions with him, clearing out people still under the sway of Ultimus. Despite bonding with the parallel version of her father, Deathpool denied feeling affection for him, repeatedly stating that her only goal was to kill Thanos. Deadpool disapproved of her revenge motivation, classifying it as \"pretty dark\". Eventually Thanos' forces found Deadpool, and Deathpool confronted Thanos. Thanos noted that the interference of her scythe sent him half across the universe from this dimension's Deadpool."

Whether it was willingly or against his will is still unknown. The organization was led by a man who went by theProfessor.\nHe was joined bySabretooth,Omega Red, andWolverine, the latter of whom had been kidnapped and brainwashed into service. It is unknown whether Deadpool was on the team whenMystiquewas part of the Program, as Wolverine helped her escape before his brainwashing.\nDuring Wade's time on the team, he began using the codename \"Deadpool\".[1]\nWhile Wolverine was there, Weapon X began cloning him. It is unknown whether they had just cloned Wolverine or if they were simply successful with just him. For reasons unknown, Deadpool did not like the clone babies. They also bondedadamantiumand unbreakable metal to his bones.\nWhen they were together, Wolverine kept calling Deadpool \"bub,\" though he calls most people that. Deadpool grew to like the name, or claimed to. One day, Deadpool and Omega Red were in the hanger of the facility. Deadpool was checking his assault weapons while talking to Omega Red. A soldier was driving a forklift moving weapons past Sabretooth.\nWolverine was also there watching them. Deadpool told his colleague that they should kill the clones of Wolverine. When asked why, he said it was because babies creeped him out while singing his own version of the \"Rock a Bye Baby\" song.\nShortly afterwards, Wolverine broke out of the facility. He chopped off the Professor's arm and killed several guards on his way out. He eventually joinedDepartment H, though seemed to forget about his time at the facility.\nProfessor then replaced his arm with a robotic claw and Weapon X replaced Wolverine with the cyberneticLady Deathstrike.

However, he became angry and transformed into Hulk who then overpowered them. The team fought back but began destroying the small town. The townspeople killed were considered acceptable collateral damage.\nAt one point, Hulk picked up a car and threw it at Omega Red. Omega Red survived then threw Hulk into a car with people inside. Deadpool ran up and began shooting at the green giant. Hulk reached into the car, grabbed the people, and leaped away.\nIt is unknown just what happened in the battle. Most of the town was destroyed, many were wounded, and there were several fatalities. Eventually, Hulk got away by leaping several miles from the town. Team X returned to tracking him.\nThe next day, the team was tracking Hulk through theCanadian Rockies. They found him fighting with Wolverine. Hulk got the upper hand at first, but thanks to his healing factor Wolverine returned with vengeance and fought the Hulk to a standstill.\nTeam X then decided to use tranquilizer darts to knock out Hulk. When the Hulk fell, they shot Wolverine to capture him as well.\nJust before their former teammate blacked out, Deadpool announced their presence saying that he was the one who shot him.[1]\nThe team brought Wolverine and Banner back to the facility. Wolverine was undressed and hung up in a dark room.\nAt some point, Lady Deathstrike came in and tried to kill him. It is unknown what stopped her from continuing.\nDeadpool and Sabretooth stood and the room waiting for Logan to wake up. When he did not, Sabretooth began beating him.\nDeadpool told Logan how much he missed him. He claimed that the Weapon X Program just was not the same without him. He missed being called \"bub\" and claimed Omega Red \"wet the bed.\"\nOmega Red and Professor then entered the room. Having overheard their conversation, Professor said that despite Deadpool's \"idiocy\" that they were glad to see Logan again.\nProfessor explained that the program had put a lot of time, money, and effort into making Logan their best soldier. Deadpool interrupted that they also used a lot of pointy things.\nProfessor had been disappointed to see Logan leave. Though he did point out that Logan led them to Banner. Deadpool then pointed out the tranquilizer darts he used to shoot in him the ass. Annoyed with his antics, Omega Red began strangling him with one of his tentacles.\nHe went on to say that Weapon X had been pursuing Hulk for weeks. Professor stated that the townspeople were just collateral damage. Professor then said that had Department H sent Logan in sooner the town may not have been damaged, and the people saved.\nProfessor admitted that they would brainwash Banner just as they did him. He claimed that Hulk was the most powerful creature on the planet under Weapon X's control. To that, Logan replied that he would kill the Professor.\nProfessor passed off the comment, saying that since they erased Logan's memories once they would do it again. He and Sabretooth then left the room. Omega Red dropped Deadpool and left with the other two.\nDeadpool got up and told Logan that Lady Deathstrike really hates him. He admitted that she tried to kill Logan in his sleep, then asked his former teammate if he still had an unbreakable skull. He pulled out his gun and shot Logan point blank in the face.\nHowever, the bullet ricocheted off the adamantium skull and Deadpool was hurt. Logan was then placed in a water-filled tube to await reprogramming.\nSome time later, Logan escaped and donned his costume. He then killed several Weapon X guards as he went through the facility. Omega Red and Deadpool went to the room where Logan was held and found the injured Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike as well as near-dead Professor.\nSabretooth and Lady Deathstrike got up and both claimed that Logan had killed the Professor. Sabretooth claimed that Professor asked them to kill Wolverine. Deadpool shook the Professor and found he was still alive. Seeing the claw marks on his back, Deadpool realized it was Sabretooth not Wolverine. He and Omega Red looked at each other knowing the truth.\nIrregardless, the team decided to hunt down Logan and make him pay. Deadpool never turned out a chance for murder. Before heading out, Deadpool told the group to \"strike a pose\" which shows Deadpool's breaking of the fourth wall.\nThe group wandered the facility until they tracked down Wolverine, who had freed Banner. Deadpool shot at them but Wolverine tackled Banner out of the way.\nOmega Red captured Wolverine through the wall. Banner tried to flee but Deadpool stopped him with his gun. Deadpool yelled \"BANG\" just to make Banner flinch.\nHowever, Wolverine managed free himself of Omega Red and slash apart Deadpool's gun, and fled with Banner.\nThe group followed and Lady Deathstrike called out to Wolverine for a four-vs-one combat. Deadpool unsheathes his katanas and leapt up and attacked as Wolverine was distracted by Sabretooth and Wolverine. However, Wolverine cut his arm into several piece. Deadpool jokingly asked Logan if he could give him a hand and went grabbed the main arm and went after the middle piece that was cut off.\nDeadpool put his arm back together, moving the pieces into their proper place, as Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike attacked Wolverine.[1]\nOmega Red had captured Wolverine and was draining him of his life. The others gathered to watch him die in agony, assuming that Banner was of no concern to them.\nThen, the five of them heard the roar of the Hulk. They turned to see that Banner had transformed. Deadpool and Lady Deathstrike dodged Hulk as he charged the group. However, Sabretooth was knocked through the wall and into the wilderness beyond.\nDeadpool shot at Hulk, but his weapons had little effect. Omega Red tried to drain Hulk's life but with his concentration divided which allowed Wolverine to escape.\nHulk used Omega Red to stop Lady Deathstrike. Wolverine tried to reason with him but Hulk began chasing him through the facility. Deadpool suddenly tagged along and leaped onto Hulk's back. He threw a grenade into Hulk's mouth then leaped down to join Wolverine in running.\nThe grenade went off and Deadpool thought that he may finally have gotten him. However, Wolverine told him he just made the giant even angrier.\nHulk emerged from the smoke ready to rip Deadpool's head off. Wolverine said that Hulk was Deadpool's to handle. Wolverine grabbed Deadpool and threw him at the giant. Deadpool tried to appeal to his \"friend\" to no effect.\nHulk simply smacked Deadpool away and chased Wolverine. Deadpool was knocked out. While he was out, Hulk and Wolverine damaged the facility. An explosion destroyed the entire complex.\nSome time later, Deadpool healed from his wounds and emerged from the wreckage. He looked around at the debris and called out to the others but heard nothing. He held his arms up excited to be alive.\nJust then, Hulk landed on him then leaped away. Deadpool managed a weak \"ow\" as he left.[1]"

With the difference of having planned to create his own video game, for which he tried to contactHigh Moon Studios.\nAt first he received a negative response from High Moon's Peter Della Penna. Deadpool triggered bombs he had hid in the video game developer's headquarters, which led Della Penna to immediately change his mind and accept Deadpool's proposal, stating that the script for the game was going to be delivered to him as soon as possible. Deadpool indignant stated that his game didn't need a script, and he started his adventure (being inside his own game) without having read it, although the inner voice he calls \"The Writer\" suggested him read it.\nHe started the tutorial in the sewers where he crossed them while teaching \"the player\" how to play. During the tutorial he inflated a bouncy castle for an unknown reason and later proceeded to make an entry in a television studio by blowing up the bathroom's floor with explosives. The reason for his visit was to get the money the corrupt media mogulChance Whiteowed him from a contract. He made his way to Chance White's penthouse after facing the mogul's bodyguards and entered his panic room by exploding the door using 20 ounces of explosives. He proceeded to punch White and tackled him out of a window, safely landing in the bouncy castle after entering the sewers by a narrow inlet.\nWade was immediately called by Peter, because Deadpool blew the game's budget in the process to get Chance White. When he was ignoring Peter's call, theMarauderssneak up on him and took White. Deadpool realized White was taken from him and decided to chase the Marauders in the sewers, facing and killingArclightin the process. AfterVertigoused her powers to make Wade dizzy, he was thrown to the current by her. Deadpool surfed the pipes, at the end of which conveniently was where the Marauders had White. Wade quietly heard as Chance informed to the Marauder's leaderMr. Sinisterthat his satellites were under the supervillain's control. Sinister killed Chance as he was no longer useful, which angered Deadpool for making him lose his money. The mercenary abruptly confronted Mr. Sinister, killing Vertigo and quickly subduingBlockbusterin the process, demanding Sinister to pay him for the money the now deceased White owed him. The villain gave no importance to Deadpool's demand, telekinetically dismembered Wade, and escaped with Blockbuster, announcing thatGenoshaawaited them.\nTheX-Menarrived to the scene and rearmed Deadpool. They tried to explain to him what did Sinister want, but Deadpool's daydream about the X-WomenDominoandPsylockedistracted him.Wolverinetold him they could use his help in this mission, for which Deadpool asked to be allowed to fly theBlackbird, Wilson was finally permitted to pilot the jet, after Logan didn't let him numerous times in the past.\nAfter fooling around for some time, Wade and the X-Men finally arrived to Genosha, crashing the Blackbird in the process. Deadpool checked on his allies, who seemingly died in the \"landing\", and realized he was on his own. Wade had caught the attention of Sinister's army of clones with the crash. After killing many of Sinister's forces,Cablearrived from the future in order to bring Wilson a \"dire warning.\" Cable's speech bored Deadpool, who didn't pay attention and decided to blow up his head with a gun in order to \"make it stop.\" After waking up, Deadpool found a note stabbed in his chest with a note from Cable, in which he asked him to go to the north end of the city, in order to meet a large breasted naked woman who claimed to be Deadpool's greatest fan. Although one of his inner voices told him not to fall for that, Deadpool still decided to take a chance to see if it was true.\nWhen he arrived to his destination, Wade's delusions made him believe Cable was his fan, although he immediately came to his senses. Summers told Deadpool they needed to go to Magneto's old citadel, and they shouldn't worry about a security tower near them where Sinister was using Chance's satellites to broadcast a signal. Without letting Cable explain why they shouldn't bother about that tower, Deadpool decided to make his way to the top of it. Wade opened a cockpit and found Mr. Sinister stuck in a chair, Wilson proceeded to mess up with his equipment, causing the tower to fall and crush Mr. Sinister. Having killed Sinister, Deadpool demanded the credits to roll out. But he was stopped by Cable, who angrily told him that Mr. Sinister was just a clone of the original Sinister.\nCable managed to convince Wade stopping Sinister's plan was more important, as if he wasn't stopped, he would kill Samantha, a lady who made the tacos Wade liked the most, and the rest of the world as well. Deadpool asked him if they could team-up to stop Sinister, but Summers told him he needed to go back to the future. The location of Magneto's citadel was way too far, and getting there would take days by walking. Wade managed to convince Cable to reprogram aSentinelboot for him. After finding two essential parts for his plan, Cable built Deadpool a boot which he used to travel the island by giant leaps, killing numerous enemies in the process, until he managed to make it perform a stable flight.\nAfter realizing he might have used way too many expensive set-ups in that level, Deadpool wondered if Peter was going to be okay with the budget. Stating that he didn't need budget, Deadpool proceeded to perform the next cutscene with papercraft, in which he accidentally crashed in mid-air withRogue, whose flying abilities were being nullified by Sinister. They crashed in an old Genoshan prison, where Rogue was captured by Blockbuster. From the fall, Deadpool lost his arm and got his neck twisted. He had to retrieve his limb from his dog,Mr. Shuggums, who mysteriously appeared on the scene. After reattaching his arm, Deadpool turned his neck to the right place and started looking for Rogue, hoping that after saving her, he would get a kiss.\nDuring his search, Deadpool got High Moon Studios to upgrade his teleport ability. Mr. Shuggums led Deadpool to where Rogue was, an arena where she was going to be executed by Blockbuster in the presence of Sinister. Deadpool decided to sneakily set some bombs around the place to impress Rogue for when he rescued her, and decided to stealth kill Mr. Sinister, who was in his lodge. Deadpool beheaded the villain and posted the photo with his head in the social network Twert. Cable contacted him and told him that he had killed another clone, and that while he wasted his time, Rogue was being brought to the arena. Deadpool went there, managed to kill Blockbuster and saved Rogue, activating the bombs to make his rescue astonishing. Rogue needed to heal, and Deadpool decided to give her his healing factor through skin contact, by kissing her. Deadpool's powers, abilities and even his inner voices were absorbed by Rogue, who recovered while Deadpool fell unconscious. Rogue took Wade's mask and started killing Sinister's goons who came to fight her, the inner voices specifically appreciated the fact of being inside a woman. Wade woke up, still disoriented, and tried to help Rogue by launching a grenade to his enemies. The projectile was caught by Mr. Shuggums, who wanted to return it to Wade as it was a toy, exploding.\nThe ground below Deadpool collapsed and Wade got his legs severed, falling to a hidden catacomb. Deadpool got hung in a part of the ceiling by his intestine, while his legs ended up in a mine wagon. The merc cut his intestine in order to get free, and fell on the head of one of Sinister's goons, making him look like a four armed monster which terrorized his fellow thugs. During the confusion, Wade was hurled to the wagon where his legs were and fell unconscious. In his dream he was visited byDeath, who asked him his help to retrieve the souls of some mutants whose corpses were being profaned by Sinister, who was harvesting their DNA in his attempt to perfect the world. Wade got his legs reattached and begun his quest to free those souls.\nWade encountered Cable once more deep in the catacombs, where he handled Sinister's army of clones while Deadpool went through different parts of the caverns in order to retrieve the souls for Death. After this task was accomplished, Death brought Wilson back to the surface, where he resumed his mission to stop Sinister.\nWolverine found Deadpool while the mercenary was getting some material for a surprise to \"the player\". Logan demanded Wilson to focus and told him to get moving to the citadel. Wade raced the X-Men across Genosha, and found Mr. Shuggums alive in the modified Sentinel boot, but it took flight before Deadpool could do anything. Deadpool got to the location where the surprise for \"the player\" was, a custom flying bike with which he would arrive to Magneto's citadel much faster than the X-Men. With an elaborated \"domino effect\" with objects, Deadpool pointed the X-Men where to go.\nDeadpool arrived near the citadel and quickly headed there. After getting there, he battled clones of the Marauders, Arclight, Vertigo and Blockbuster, until numerous clones of Sinister showed up in order to face him. After the clones were killed, the X-Men arrived to the citadel. The real Sinister finally showed up angry with Deadpool's interference, quickly subduing the X-Men using concussive blasts. Sinister started insulting Deadpool, without noticing he was standing right in a giant \"X\" the mercenary had painted before the final battle. Wade asked the player to push a button in order to execute his super-awesome plan. Deadpool proceeded to punch Sinister in his crotch, and used the Sentinel boot to crush him when he was reeling from the pain, finally killing him. The X-Men recovered and Cable arrived from the future in order to congratulate his friend. After reappearing on top of the boot, Deadpool demanded the credits to roll out."

Stryker collected DNA from mutants whose powers could be used collectively within one body without destroying it. With Creed's help, Stryker gathered the DNA of several mutants, including Wraith, Bradley,Scott Summers, and Logan, with Wade being the host body.

The changes he made back in Germantown had affected the timeline allowing the soldiers to have tanks and robots during theAmerican Civil War. This gave Deadpool a huge advantage over Cable and his group after they showed. Deadpool and his soldiers kept the mutants,WarpathandDominoat bay with the advanced technology while Cable traveled back to 1777 to check on the others.\nAs Deadpool lost his list of things to change, Cable reappeared prompting a fight between the two of them.

Out of a need to belong and feel wanted, she joined the side of a group of rebels fighting against loyalists in theUnited States.\nAccording to Wanda, the fight started because fascists in the federal government started to impose their will on the people, a schism in congress, generals were taking sides and states declared independence, which eventually to United States' current situation.\nGeneral Americais leading the loyalists and Wanda is leading an assault against forces inWashington, D.C.and meets up against Wanda's one-woman resistance. The two have met before - leading to Deadpool's interference (withHeadpool) and the amputation of the General's right arm.[1]As the two meet again, he starts to get the better of her but Deadpool teleports in and helps Wanda take out General America. Deadpool informs Wanda of the plight at hand and because she is so easily sweet-talked into things, she quickly accepts and the two teleport out of that universe. Later when Deadpool returned to his apartment with Headpool, Lady Deadpool is found playing guitar hero withKidpool.[2]After her adventures with the Deadpool Corps, she eventually returns home.[citation needed]\nSeeing Wanda all on her own, we learn that she is a relatively secluded person, not wanting to go out into the sun until her Cable goes out. Once outside, she is hired byShamus Onusto protect the face of some \"Rebel's Force.\" Wanda quickly falls in love with the failed actor turned Rebel LeaderCharles Randolph, who happens to already have a girlfriend.[citation needed]\nWanda continues to try and impress Charles one way or another. Lucky for Charles she was there when a very angry man, who had been left by his wife and kids because they wanted to follow the rebellion, decided to assault Charles with his shoe, Wanda is there to intercept the shoe with her face. Losing several teeth in the process but it was worth it to her.

When they arrived at their destination, they asked for help from a police officer, who led them to an alley and revealed himself as being an U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. agent whose backup had just arrived. As Ellie was being taken, Joshua suffered from a heart attack. Luckily, Deadpool was disguised as one of the agents and rescued Ellie. Before escaping with the child, Deadpool shot into the air to attract the attention of theChicago Police Departmentso they could help Joshua. As they got into a building, Ellie asked if Deadpool was her father.[10]\nIn the end, Deadpool was cornered by U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. agents, and theFlag-Smasherhimself, who, in retaliation for Deadpool's actions, threw Ellie out of a window; however,EvanandQuentin Quire, who were alerted by Deadpool, came to Ellie's aid, and they managed to save her at the last minute.\nDeadpool then proceeded to savagely beat the Flag-Smasher, forbidding him from ever threatening Eleanor again. He then enlisted Quentin's help again, this time to have the police coroner declare Eleanor dead.\nEllie, under an assumed identity, was sent to live with Emily Preston's family, with Deadpool content with watching her from afar. Quentin and Evan offered to have Ellie's mind altered to forget her painful ordeal and Joshua's death, but Deadpool refused, letting Ellie's psyche heal in time with the Prestons and his own support.[11]\nUnder the influence of the eye of the deceased Uatu, S.H.I.E.L.D agentScott Adsithad a vision from the past of Butler discovering Ellie'sX-Gene, which ultimately had led to the events of Carmelita's capture.[3]\nWhen U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. tried to have revenge on Deadpool for destroying their Helicarrier and slaughtering countless of their agents, they tried to kill his allies, including Ellie, by attackingtheir house; however, they survived the assault thanks to the magic ofMichael the Necromancerand escaped to a safe location. After Deadpool retaliated and murdered all of U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.'s agents, he decided to give up his life as Deadpool. As he was celebrating the start of a new life with his friends and family, anIncursionbetweenEarth-616andEarth-1610caused the collision and destruction of both universe's planetsEarth, with Deadpool and his allies dying in the process.[2]\nTheMultiversewas eventually restored along with all of its inhabitants, including Ellie.[12]Ellie, Emily, and her family moved toArizonaunder witness protection as a result of Deadpool's sky-rocketed popularity,[13]because Wade feared his fame could endanger them.[12]When the villainousMadcapimpersonated Deadpool to beat up Scott Adsit, Emily, and her family decided to leave witness protection and help Deadpool,[13]eventually becoming a part of his life once again.[14]\nEmily and the Prestons were put in dire risk as part of a revenge plot schemed by Madcap, who had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier ofan airborne virusthat infected his family. Deadpool had to resort toStryfe, the evil clone of his time-travelling allyCable. Stryfe handed over to Deadpool a cure of Ellie and the Prestons' fatal condition, one that wouldn't exist until the future.[15]\nRaised by herfather, underHydra's rule\nDeadpool fractured his relationship with Ellie when, at the beginning ofHydra'sempire, he kidnapped her from the Prestons and took her with him toWashington, D.C..[16]Having become a Hydra operative, Deadpool neglected Ellie, leading her to cause problems ather new school.[17]When Deadpool disappeared for almost a week, Ellie returned toQueenson her own.[18]When they learned that Deadpool had killed Emily, Ellie and what remained of the Preston family leftNew York Cityto escape from Wade.[19]\nAlthough they parted on bad terms, Ellie was later shown to have forgiven her father. She ran into him on a class trip, but due to mind-wiping himself, he did not recognize her. Despite this, she followed him on one of his missions and tried to prevent him from killing his target- trying to show he was a better man than that.[20]She was later seen watching her father's confrontation with an enemy on the news. As Wade sat completely shattered, Ellie began to tear up before putting away her iPad and falling asleep.[21]\nWhenMephistoand Weasel went after Ellie, Wade regained his memories of her. He was shown a vision of thefuture where Ellie became a hero in the year 2099. Mephisto warned Deadpool that should he not cooperate, Ellie would be mentored under Tasmanian and end up becoming his soul collector, carrying out the job Deadpool had refused. Wade was determined to not let this happen and traveled back to stop Tasmanian from taking Ellie. After defeating him, Wade hugged Ellie before once again saying goodbye to her. Although she wanted him to stay, Wade told her that sometimes one really can't go home again. He left with Mephisto as Ellie went back inside her home with the Prestons.[22]\nEllie becomes Deadpool\nMutant Physiology:Ellie is amutant, with powers similar to that of her father Deadpool, if not better.[3][25]"

Fury had known Peter's parents and sought Peter to enter into his service. He became Fury's assistant, helping him on all manner of assignments. Having to stay inEngland, Peter had to change his surname to Parquagh as duringQueen Elizabeth's rule, Scots were not taken favorably well due to James VI ofScotland.[1]\nPeter Parquagh\nPeter was sent to escortVirginia Dareas she met with Queen Elizabeth and was present when she was taken away by one ofCount Doom's assassins. When Virginia was recovered he was sent toDr. Strangeto have him attend to her. Fury then sent Peter toCarlos Javier's school with a message that he should surrender when Fury's armies came, to avoid bloodshed. When Fury planned on betrayingKing Jameshe released Peter from his service, telling him to return to his aunt and uncle. Unfortunately, however, Peter was captured and questioned by King James, then sent toRoanokewithDavid Bannerto attempt to kill Fury not before allowing him to witness Dr. Strange's live execution. When Fury had slaughtered the rest of the crew sent to kill him, he told Peter that he would let him kill him if he wanted, but Peter simply left. After Fury and the heroes had resolved the situation with the time portal, and Banner's selflessness to protect Peter from the radiation of the anomaly which turned him into the Hulk, Virginia offered Peter to stay with her andher fatherin the colony. Peter accepted, planning to get his aunt and uncle out of England to join him. He was then bitten by a spider that had been exposed to the portal's temporal energies and was gifted as a 'Witchbreed'.[4]\nAs Peter grew up, he had taken the heroic identity of \"The Spider\" and fell in love with Virginia Dare. Also his heroism earned the suspicious scrutiny of Roanoke's journalist printerJonah Jameson, who Peter worked for. Tragically, Virginia was shot and killed byNorman Osborne. He was therefore sent to England to be judged, and Parquagh went along, to make sure Osborne didn't escape.\nThe Spider's first suit\nAfter a fight with theKing's Pinand his master commanderBull's Eye, Osborne was left disfigured and Peter left him to deliver a illegal dinosaur eggs to theBaron Octavius. He also met the actressMarion Watsonne, with whom he fell in love. Later Octavius captured the Watsonnes in order to lure Peter to him, whom he believed was a \"witchbreed\", to get his blood for a concoction. After facing theLizard, Osborne (as the Goblin) and Octavius himself, Peter was able to leave with his new flame and her family.[5]\nPeter was recruited by theS.H.I.E.L.D.ofEarth-TRN461into theSpider-Men, a group of Spider-Man analogs assembled to combat theMultiversal Sinister Six.[6]\nAmong theSpider-Men\nDuring a stage show in theGlobe Theatre,Morlunappeared before him. Peter told Marion's father to take her away after his Spider-Sense warned him that Morlun was a threat, and he engaged Morlun. However, Morlun was much too powerful for Peter, as a single punch to Morlun's face broke his hand. Morlun proceeded to bring the Globe Theatre down around everyone as he staked Peter with one of the support beams, killing him. He absorbed his life essence, before disappearing into another dimension, declaring thatall spiders would die.[2]"

Spider-Man caught him in the act and during their scuffle, he accidentally broke the tablet.Madame Webappeared and explained that the tablet pieces had shattered acrossEarth-TRN580,Earth-TRN581, and the present and future ofEarth-TRN579and recruited Peter'salternateselvesand his future successor,Miguel O'Hara, to reassemble the tablet.\nMysterio, who had a fragment, tracked down Spider-Man to Madame Web's base of operations and threatened to kill her unless he handed over the other fragments. He tried to avoid giving him the fragments, but the tablet reassembled itself in Mysterio's hands. He began to change Earth-TRN579 into his image, but Madame Web was able to teleport the other three Spider-Men to Earth-TRN579 and they defeated Mysterio.[1]Unlike the other Spider-Men (barring Noir), who mocked each other, Spider-Man hoped to meet up with them again and jokingly stated he wanted to start a \"bridge club\" with them.\nWhenDoctor Sloanreturned back in time, he createdanother timeline, wherePeter's counterpartworked forAlchemax. This Peter'sMary Janewould eventually die, leaving thefuture Peter Parkerto get control of the timestream and avoid his past mistakes. However, his plans were stopped and when he was sucked into the same portal Sloan used to return back in time along withAtrocity, the timestream returned back to normal and the memories of that reality's Peter returned to this Peter Parker.[2]\nDuring the downfall of theHeroic Age, it was believed that Spider-Man was killed byDoctor Octopus.[1]\nalong with:"

Whilst practicing on his motorbike, Takuya began to receive telepathic messages fromGariacalling out to him. His sister,ShinkoandHitomi Sakumaasked for his assistance in investigating the crashedLeopardonbut Takuya refused as he had a race to compete in. His father accepted this and set out with Shinko and Hitomi. Later, before leaving for the contest, Takuya received more messages from Garia and went to investigate. In the mountains he found Hitomi and Shinko who told Takuya their father had been attacked. Takuya found his dying father who asked him to continue his work into discovering what alien invaders were trying to conquer Earth. After his father died, Takuya was attacked by theIron Cross Armyand gravely injured and he fell into the cave where Garia was imprisoned. Garia saved his life by giving him theSpider BraceletandSpider Extractand informed Takuya of the invasion ofProfessor Monster, as well as his personal history.[2]\nBack at his house, Garia told Takuya of his new costume and abilities and tested them out, before discovering the Iron Cross Army had kidnappedProfessor Fujita. Spider-Man set out to confront the group and freed the Professor. He was then attacked by his firstMachine BemmonsterBoukunryuand found himself unable to defeat the monster, until he summonedLeopardonand unleashed its sword vigor and destroyed Boukunryu, vowing to defeat the rest of the Iron Cross Army.[2]\nTakuya was later informed by Hitomi that a train had mysteriously overturned. They investigated and during the course of the investigation, the pair were attacked by the Iron Cross Army. Takuya had Hitomi flee so he could change into Spider-Man and was able to defeat the group, but Hitomi believed that Takuya had abandoned her. Later Takuya tracked down the Iron Cross Army and discoveredSoutoukinwas trying to crash another train, but was able to defeat him using Leopardon.[3]\nTakuya was brought into the war against theInheritorsbyEarth-616'sSpider-ManandSpider-Girl, as well asEarth-65'sSpider-Woman. As soon as the group arrived in their former safe zone,Earth-13, Takuya, who was already piloting theLeopardon, faced off againstSolus, but the villain made quick work of the giant robot. Luckily, Takuya managed to escape the confrontation alive and join the rest of thespiders.[4]\nYamashiro stayed with the group of Spiders and during the final battle inLoomworld, he was reunited with Leopardon.Spider-Man 2099andLady Spidermanaged to fix the robot with\"some future tech and some steam-power\". After the Inheritors' defeat, Takuya safely returned to his world.[5]\nSomehow either prior to or during the battle with the Inheritors, Professor Monster returned as Prime Minister Monster, eventually engaging Takuya in a decisive battle, Spider-Man managed to capture the living head of Prime Minister Monster and take him to Planet Spider for judgment.[6]\nYamashiro remained on Planet Spider, where he had lived in a traditional Japanese house, and allowedSpider-Zeroto stay with him untilMilescame. Soon after, Spider-Zero and Miles began their journey to repair the multiverse.[7]"

Peter was academically gifted, displaying an uncanny affinity for science that was nothing short of genius. As a student atMidtown High School, Peter attended a public evening exhibition where aspider, accidentally irradiated by a particle beam, fell onto Peter's hand and bit him. Peter left the exhibition in a daze and walked into the path of an oncoming car. Without thinking, Peter jumped onto the side of a wall to which he stuck with his bare hands. Stunned, he realized he had acquired superhuman powers similar to those of a spider: enhanced strength and agility, and the ability to cling to almost any surface.\nTo test his new powers, Peter donned a mask and took part in an all-comers wrestling match againstCrusher Hogan, winning with ease. Spotted by a talent scout who promised to arrange a TV appearance, Peter hurried home and created a more elaborate costume. Thus Spider-Man was born. With his new powers and sudden fame, Peter promised himself he would take care of Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Following his first appearance on television Peter ended up making the decision that would change his life. Peter tackled a burglar escaping past him, saving the owner of the wrestling arena thousands of dollars. The wrestling arena owner thanked Peter by promising Spider-Man a prominent role in his brand new wrestling league.\nThe wrestling league was a huge success and Spider-Man became its star. As the money rolled in, he decided to reveal to his aunt and uncle the powers he had acquired from the spider bite. Initially, his aunt was frightened by these powers, but Uncle Ben was ecstatic. He was happy for his nephew and could see these amazing powers gave Peter self-confidence and a belief in himself he did not have before.\nAt this time the Mutant-Human War went into full swing. Peter, as the mysterious Spider-Man, was accused of being a mutant by the local press. Peter wanted to deny it, but Uncle Ben advised him to stay quiet. Ben could see that Peter was the idol of mutants everywhere. Finally, one of them was not afraid to be seen in public. Ben believed if Peter could give hope to those children who were born different than normal humans, then he should. Uncle Ben's wisdom paid off in the end when the Mutant-Human War ended with mutants victorious. The most public and popular of mutants, Peter revealed his true identity and became an international superstar as a wrestler and an actor. He even starred in a movie with his high school human friendMary Jane Watson, a controversial move since normal humans rarely scored major lead actor roles. The movie ended up launching Mary Jane's career and established Peter as a \"can't miss\" star.\nShortly thereafter, Peter took a break from public life. He married his high school sweetheart,Gwen Stacy, and the two of them attended college together, earning doctorates. Peter returned to public life and he and his Uncle Ben set upSpider-Man, Inc., spreading out into many areas including science and charity work.[1]\nHe was right to be concerned as they did find out, when an embitteredJ. Jonah Jamesonwas given, and revealed to the world, a journal of Peter's which Peter in the guise of the Green Goblin, suffering from some mental instability caused by sensing the truth about his world, gifted to him as he wanted it to be used to release his secret and sabotage his life.[5]\nWhen the truth about how Peter gained his powers was revealed his entire life imploded, he came under public fire for misrepresenting himself as a mutant for years, a movie he starred in about his life was pulled from theatres, stock in his business began to tank, his family members were forced to seclude themselves in their estate, and Peter himself tried to hide for a time.The Rhinoaccidentally harmedCrusher Hoganwhen Peter sent him to see if he knew anything about the Green Goblin, and Rhino began to face public backlash himself which led to him tearing upTimes Squarein a rage until Peter arrived and stopped him. Immediately after calming Rhino down and angry mob chased Peter off, leading him to return to his family and apologize for lying to them for so long.[6]\nRhino was contacted by the Green Goblin, who offered him the chance to further ruin Peter. Rhino was enraged though as the revelations about Peter had cost him the best life he could have hoped for, when he arrived at their meeting place he broughtOx,Vulture, andElectrowith him. Working together they managed to subdue and unmask the Goblin just as Gwen walked in on them, revealing to all that he was actually Peter Parker. Peter tried to convince them he was posing as the Goblin to lure the real one out but they were unconvinced, leading him to bluff that he would harm his wife if they didn't let him go. ASentinelcaptured an image of Peter in the Goblin costume and this information led to even further anti-human crack downs, especially among those trying to pass as mutants.[7]\nThe Stacy-Parker family tried to steal Peter's journal back from Jonah who defended it with a remote controlledSpider-Slayerrobot until Peter arrived and destroyed it to protect his family. Peter tried to take the journal back with him but his father-in-law was able to keep hold of it and the entire family read it and discovered that in the journal was not only the truth about Peter not being a mutant, but also the fact that he knew that this was not the way things were supposed to be, that he knew Gwen, Uncle Ben, andGwen's fathershould be dead. Meanwhile Peter was trying to protect humans from the abuse they were suffering because of him, only to find those he was trying to protect turning against him for increasing the difficulties they face and trying to kill him in hopes of appeasing mutant police officers.[8]\nPeter contacted his aunt and uncle and told them that he had always felt guilty for what he had and that the journal included 'stories' he had made up to try and justify that guilt. Eventually this wasn't enough and he began sabotaging his life for real, such as adopting the Green Goblin persona. Peter decided that the only way to get mutants to back off from the humans was to give them what they wanted, his death. With help from his Uncle Ben he faked his suicide by hanging himself from a bridge and then went into hiding with his entire family and leftMagnetoa message, that if he wanted him to stay dead he would have to 'ease up on the humans'.[8]\nAt some point his reality merged with thePrime Marvel Universedue to theScarlet Witchand he merged with hisPrime universe counterpartwhenLayla Millerused her powers to awaken the mainstream Peter.[9]\nAfter a period of time passed with his family, and without beingSpider-Man, he returned toNew Yorkand reprised his role.[10]Years later,Karntravelled toEarth-58163during his hunt for Spiders all across theMultiverse. He attacked and murdered Spider-Man, leaving his corpse with two puncture marks in the chest. His body was found by the reality-displacedSuperior Spider-Man.[3]\nSpider-Man's corpse found by Otto Octavius\nPeter was later resurrected through unknown means. He was recruited into theSpider-ArmybySpider-Gwenand helped defeat theInheritors.[4]"

Сюжет повествует о четырёх Людях-пауках из разных реальностей мультивселенной, объединившихся для её спасения.\n«Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions» получила преимущественно положительные отзывы от критиков. Рецензенты хвалили идею объединения четырёх вселенных из комиксов Marvel, озвучку персонажей и юмористическую составляющую. Критике подверглись однообразность уровней, выбор злодеев и общий дизайн кат-сцен, а также технические проблемы.\nИгроку предстоит управлять четырьмя персонажами из различных вселенных, каждый из которых обладает своими навыками боя.\nБой с боссом\nУдивительный Человек-паук комбинирует рукопашный бой и атаки паутиной, а также сочетает ближний и дальний бой. Он может наносить больший урон, создавая паутиной разное оружие вроде молотов и булавы, а также использовать посторонние предметы, которые бросает в противника.\nАтака из тени\nЧеловек-паук Нуар скрывается в тенях и в них же нападает на противников, сразу же вырубая, в чём и заключается геймплей. Когда противники его не видят, экран окрашен в чёрно-белый цвет. Когда же кто-то из противников замечает Человека-паука, то полоска, показывающая здоровье персонажа, обводится красным, а все противники наступают в атаку. В этом случае можно либо уйти в тень и дождаться того, как все успокоятся, либо попытаться быстро убить противника, заметившего Человека-паука, но данный способ, скорее всего, будет стоить герою жизни.\nПолёт\nЧеловек-паук 2099 использует в бою акробатику и продвинутость своего костюма, который позволяет ему управлять телом при падении. Также он обладает ускоренным восприятием, позволяющим ему ускоряться (в глазах игрока это выглядит, скорее, как замедление всего окружающего) и тем самым уклоняться от более мощных атак.\nРежим ярости\nСовершенный Человек-паук обладает симбиотом, позволяющим ему легко справляться с противниками с помощью создаваемых им шипов и щупалец. Также игрок может активировать «режим ярости», позволяющий ему наносить наиболее сильные удары.\nВозможности персонажей можно улучшать, а также покупать новые. Покупка в игре осуществляется за игровую валюту, собирать которую можно на всех уровнях — они выполнены в форме пауков, при этом в каждой вселенной знак на валюте выглядит по-разному.\nУровни «Shattered Dimensions» весьма однообразны и строятся по одной схеме: игрок должен долгое время преследовать злодея, сражаться с его подручными, спасать взятых в плен гражданских и несколько раз биться с ним самим. Как и во множестве других игр, здесь также имеется три уровня сложности.\nБой с боссом от первого лица\nВо время сражения с боссами камера может переключиться на вид от первого лица. Тогда игрок может, используя определённые комбинации кнопок (в случае с Nintendo Wii используются джойстики), наносить удары боссу в ближнем бою, а также уклоняться от атак противника.\nВ меню имеется возможность просмотра концепт-арта и прочих дополнительных материалов. Как и во многих прошлых и последующих играх о Человеке-пауке, проходя миссии, игрок может разблокировать костюмы разные костюмы для каждого персонажа, которые лишь меняют его внешний вид.\nМистериопроникает вуниверситет Эмпайр-Стейт, чтобы выкрасть ценный экспонат —скрижаль порядка и хаоса. В этот момент появляетсяЧеловек-пауки пытается помешать злодею. Во время драки супергерой случайно разбивает скрижаль. Как только Мистерио сбегает с одним осколком, Человеку-пауку являетсяМадам паутинаи объясняет, что скрижаль — могущественный магический артефакт, и если хотя бы его осколок попадёт в плохие руки, то последствия будут ужасны. Теперь, когда Человек-паук разбил скрижаль, осколки оказались в разных мирах мультивселенной — в «прошлом, которого никогда не было», «альтернативном настоящем» и «отдалённом будущем, которое может никогда не наступить»; причём в каждой вселенной присутствует свойЧеловек-паук. Чтобы восстановить баланс во вселенной, Мадам паутина также рекрутирует Людей пауков из остальных трёх вселенных для помощи в поисках осколков.\nAmazing-Человек-паук находит один осколок на крыше одного из домов под грудами камней;Ultimate-Человек-паукнаходит осколок на дамбе (причём Мадам паутина одаривает егокостюмом-симбиотом. Поначалу Человек-паук пытается избавиться от него, но Мадам паутина обещает, что не позволит костюму завладеть телом);Человек-паук 2099находит осколок в здании компании «Алкемакс», попутно сразившись с охранниками из «Публичного взгляда»;Человек-паук Нуар, прячась в тенях, находит осколок на вокзале, попутно сразившись с головорезами. После того, как все четыре Человека-паука отдают свои осколки Мадам паутине, она предупреждает их, что им повезло, что осколки не попали в плохие руки. В это время Мистерио обнаруживает силы осколка скрижали и с его помощью становится настоящим колдуном.\nАкт первый\nВ Amazing-вселенной Человек-паук находит осколок в логовеКрэйвена Охотника. Артефакт почти удаётся забрать, однако объявляется сам Крэйвен и усыпляет Спайди; просыпается он в джунглях, где Крэйвен предлагает ему поучаствовать в охоте, и если Человек-паук сможет выжить, то получит осколок. Герой пробирается через разные ловушки и учеников Крэйвена и встречается с самим охотником на большой арене, где Крэйвен собирался показать своим ученикам, на что он способен, однако, тот терпит поражение. Будучи опозоренным перед своими учениками, Крэйвен в ярости поглощает силы осколка, из-за чего обретает сверхчеловеческую скорость. Однако для использования этих сил ему нужен был небольшой отдых, во время которого Человек-паук и победил его, а затем и забрал осколок.\nВ Нуар-вселенной Человек-паук, по наводкеФелиции Харди, находит осколок уКувалды, перевозящего артефактНорману Озборну. Попутно освобождая взятых Кувалдой заложников и расправляясь с головорезами мафиози, Человек-паук, перемещаясь в тени, следует за Кувалдой. Вскоре злодей пытается убить Человека-паука из большой турели на рельсах, но, потерпев поражение, натравляет на героя большую группу головорезов. Когда и эта попытка покончить с Человеком-пауком проваливается, Кувалда поглощает силу осколка, из-за чего два автомата сливаются с его руками. Обезумленный и желающий теперь свергнуть Озборна Кувалда противостоит Человеку-пауку на заброшенном складе, но, пуская туман, герою удаётся из тени разобраться с мафиози и отобрать осколок.\nВо вселенной 2099 Человек-паук оказывается атакованХобгоблином— таинственным наёмником, обладающим осколком. Их погоня привлекает «Публичный взгляд», что усложняет работу для Человека-паука. Забравшись на крышу здания «Алкемакс», Хобгоблин объединяет свои пси-силы с силой осколка, создав свою реальность и клонов для противостояния Человеку-пауку. Тем не менее, герою удаётся победить Хобгоблина и достать осколок; при дальнейшем рассмотрении своего нового противника Человек-паук замечает, что крылья Хобгоблина состоят из нановолокон, и только «Алкемакс» могли снабдить злодея подобной технологией.\nВ Ultimate-вселенной Человек-паук обнаруживает осколок в рукахЭлектро, атакующего ближайшую плотину. Герой начинает высмеивать противника, и в ярости Электро использует осколок, чтобы, поглощая электричество плотины, становиться больше в размере; также Электро создаёт электрических существ, враждебных по отношению к Спайди. После спасения рабочих и починки плотины, пробившись через прислужников Электро, Человек-паук добирается до самого злодея, значительно увеличившегося в размерах. Герою удаётся обманов заставить Электро разрушить плотину, впоследствии чего огромная масса воды выводит злодея из строя.\nЛюди-пауки отдают осколки Мадам паутине. В это время Мистерио, пользуясь силами осколка для своих целей, случайно узнаёт о существовании остальных и отправляется на их поиски.\nАкт второй\nВ Amazing-вселенной Человек-паук находит очередной осколок на заброшенной каменоломне «Roxxon Industries». Забрать артефакт не позволяетПесочный человек. Захватив осколок, злодей захватывает власть на каменоломне, создавая многочисленных слуг из песка. В нескольких формах Песочный человек пытается одолеть Человека-паука, но постоянно терпит поражение, так как под рукой стенолаза оказываются бочки с водой. В конце концов Песочный человек превращается в песочное торнадо и разделяет свою личность на три отдельные. Однако это лишь ослабляет его и позволяет Человеку-пауку одержать победу и забрать осколок.\nВ Нуар-вселенной Человек-паук обнаруживает осколок в руках убийцы своего дяди —каннибалапо прозвищуСтервятник, которому скрижаль дала способность к телепортации. Следуя за маньяком по пятам, попутно Человек-паук разбирается с гангстерами, нанятыми Стервятником, а также спасает мирных жителей из дома, подожжённого Стервятником, дабы задержать героя. Перед последним боем Человек-паук подслушивает разговоры головорезов о том, что Стервятник, как и Кувалда, собирается сместить Нормана Озборна с должности (У которого также имеется осколок). После победы над Стервятником, чьей слабостью оказался свет прожекторов, Человек-паук, теперь знающий, что последний осколок у Озборна, решает направиться к нему.\nВо вселенной 2099 Человек-паук следит за сотрудниками «Публичного взгляда», перевозящими осколок, когда на тех внезапно нападаетСкорпион; монстр похищает осколок и сбегает. Человек-паук начинает преследовать Скорпиона, который, используя силу скрижали, откладывает кислотные яйца в здании «Алкемакс», из которого со всплеском кислоты вылупляются его небольшие копии. Попутно спася некоторых учёных, попавших в центр борьбы «Публичного взгляда» с «детёнышами» Скорпиона, Человек-паук добирается до самого Скорпиона, от которого узнаёт, что осколок выкрасть его попросила выкрасть «леди с блестящими руками», которая взамен пообещала сделать его человеком. Одержав над монстром победу и заполучив осколок, Человек-паук выражает печаль по поводу Скорпиона, ведь тот не имел злых намерений.\nВ Ultimate-вселенной Человек-паук, посматривая телевизор, натыкается на телешоу «Фактор боли», ведущим которого является считавшийся мёртвымДэдпул. Он бросает вызов стенолазу, а за победу предлагает осколок скрижали. Не имея другого выбора, Человек-паук отправляется на место проведения шоу — нефтяной танкер посреди океана. Решив покончить с шоу, Человек-паук начинает ломать камеры, чем заставляет Дэдпула натравить на него своих фанатов, а затем и напасть самому. В конце концов Человек-паук добирается до арены, на которой Дэдпул отдаёт ему поддельный осколок, а затем, узнав о силах настоящего, использует силу скрижали, чтобы клонировать себя. Однако, несмотря на это, Человек-паук всё равно побеждает и забирает осколок.\nЛюди-пауки отдают найденные осколки Мадам паутине, но при Amazing-Человеке-пауке на ясновидящую нападает Мистерио и обещает убить её, если не получит остальные части скрижали. Не имея другого выбора, Человек-паук отправляется на поиски последнего осколка.\nАкт третий\nВ Amazing-вселенной Человек-паук находит последний осколок на строительной площадке, как вдруг на неё врываетсяДжаггернаут, преследуемыйДикой стаей, желающей награду за убийство злодея. Случайно, неизвестно даже для себя, Джаггернаут захватывает осколок, из-за чего Человеку-пауку приходится преследовать злодея. Из-за этого стенолаз также становится целью Дикой стаи, так как награда назначена и за него. Погоня заканчивается на стройкеOscorp Tower, где из-за битвы Человека-паука и Джаггернаута здание рушится. Дикая стая отступает, но Джаггернаут случайно обнаруживает осколок и ненароком использует его, чтобы увеличить свою физическую силу. Но даже несмотря на это, Джаггернаут терпит поражение, и Человек-паук забирает осколок.\nВ Нуар-вселенной Норман Озборн использует силу скрижали и превращается в уродливого монстра. Вместе со своими головорезами он устраивает карнавал, дабы привлечь внимание Человека-паука. Герою удаётся скрытно расправиться с бандитами и освободить заложников. После этого Гоблин нападает на стенолаза, но, начиная проигрывать, сбегает в цирк уродов. Последовав за ним, Человек-паук проходит через группы преступников и ловушки, устроенные Гоблином. Под конец на арене цирка проходит финальный бой между Человеком-пауком и Гоблином, который ранее лишь прятался и атаковал из теней. Благодаря своим скрытности и силе Человеку-пауку удаётся победить и забрать осколок.\nЧеловек-паук 2099 забирается в засекреченную лабораторию «Алкемакс», где находит осколок в стальных щупальцах учёного Серены Пател, главытеневго отдела «Алкемакс», создателя Хобгоблина и нанимателя Скорпиона. Сошедшая с ума из-за силы осколка Серена собирается использовать его силу для питания опасного реактора. Следуя за учёным по зданию, Человек-паук сражается с многочисленными сотрудниками «Публичного взгляда», а также с генетическими экспериментами Серены. В итоге Человек-паук отключает четыре батареи реактора (не без помощи учёных «Алкемакс», также посчитавших план Пател безумным). Тем не менее, сам реактор не отключается, и стенолазу приходится забраться в его главный отсек, управляемый Сереной, которая хочет устроить катастрофу, чтобы продемонстрировать силу артефакта. Тем не менее, Человеку-пауку удаётся выключить генератор и, победив злодейку, забрать осколок.\nВ Ultimate-вселенной Человек-паук добирается доТрискелион, где «Щ.И.Т.» хранит осколок. Там он, неожиданно для себя, обнаруживает развалины и красные отростки, что означает возвращениеКарнажа. Как оказалось, за спинойНика Фьюрив «Щ.И.Т.» проводили опыты со осколком, во время одного из которых его соединили с Карнажем, из-за чего тот научился, высасывая из людей их жизнь, превращать их в зомби-слуг. Продвигаясь по оккупированной Карнажем базе, Человек-паук сталкивается с многочисленными зомби-агентами «Щ.И.Т.», а также с чудовищами, созданными Карнажем как прислуга, ироботами, созданными для уничтожения Карнажа, но нападающими также и на Человека-паука из-за костюма-симбиота. После короткой битвы с Карнажем и спасения от упавшегогеликарриера, Человек-паук добирается до последнего этажа Трискелиона, где обнаруживает огромное яйцо Карнажа. При помощи перепрограммированных роботов, не нападающих на него, Спайди удаётся вырвать Карнажа из яйца, а затем победить. Монстра заваливает обломками, а Человек-паук заполучает осколок.\nАкт последний\nAmazing-Человек-паук не решается отдать оставшиеся осколки Мистерио. В конце концов он решает напасть на Мистерио, но осколки скрижали внезапно начинают соединяться в руках злодея, что делает его всемогущим. С помощью обретённых сил Мистерио разрушает грани между реальностями, дабы построить новый мир под собственным правлением. Это также позволяет Мадам паутине призвать на помощь остальных четверых Людей-пауков. Она призывает их работать сообща, чтобы спасти мультивселенную:\nМистерио теряет скрижаль, и четверо Людей-пауков избивают его до потери сознания. Когда реальности возвращаются к обычному состоянию, Мадам паутина возвращает Людей-пауков в свои миры.\nК Мадам паутине вдруг являетсяСвин-паук, желающий помочь в спасении мультивселенной, но затем он понимает, что немного опоздал.\nГлавные персонажи\nВторостепенные персонажи\nАнтагонисты\nОстальные персонажи\nРасы и виды\nЛокации\nПредметы\nТранспорт\n\n«Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions» была анонсирована 30 марта 2010 года.

Making the next day's issue of theDaily Globe, Spider-Man met with film producerJ.B. Priestabout a movie deal. Later that night, after brushing offFlash Thompsonat school, Peter Parker once again donned his Spider-Man costume and guest-hosted onThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, where he interviewed an actress. The episode was interrupted with a news report announcing the death ofJohn Jamesonand when Peter returned home, he revealed his identity to hisauntanduncle. After Ben tried to talk Peter out of becoming a celebrity and focusing on his education, Peter angrily left them behind and became a famous movie star. WhenDaily BugleeditorJ. Jonah Jamesonhad Spider-Man's identity uncovered and published it in his paper, Spider-Man threatened Jameson by hiring a group of gunmen to dress up in costumes and threaten Jonah. Then, after Jameson was terrified for his life, Spider-Man arrived and passed it of as a joke to get the point across not to cross him again.\nThe next day, Spider-Man set off to start the next phase of his career by sneaking into theBaxter Building. After \"testing\" theFantastic Four, Spider-Man offered them his services as their licensing and promotion agent, which they reluctantly accepted. In the weeks that followed, Spider-Man also signed up theAvengersand theX-Men, following that up with buying a comic book company. After witnessingDaredevil's battle with theFixer, Spider-Man offered his services to Daredevil. Spider-Man's first act was to replace Daredevil's yellow costume with a red costume involving a cape and a trident, which angered Daredevil as he thought that the cape and the trident were pointless. Despite that, Spider-Man remained Daredevil's agent and placed billboards around the city promoting the hero. When J. Jonah Jameson returned and filed a court suit claiming Spider-Man had been promoting a known vigilante, Spider-Man followed Jameson's secretaryBetty Brantwhen she was confronted by theEnforcersover herbrother's gambling debts. Discovering that the Enforcers were hired by theBig Man, better known as Daily Bugle reported Frederick Foswell, Spider-Man wrote an article connecting Foswell to Jameson for a rival newspaper.\nSix months later, during the filming ofSpider-Man vs. the Monster that Ate Los Angeles, Spider-Man was zapped by an unscripted electric shock given off by the film's monsterDragoom. Luckily, he was saved by Daredevil. Later, Peter was visited by Daredevil in his mansion and was warned that the shock could have killed him. Daredevil also explained that Spider-Man had a hit out on him and offered to stay and watch Peter's workout, thinking he might be in danger. During the workout, Peter was slashed by poison-tipped darts claws by a disguisedKraven the Hunter. Two days later, Peter finally agreed that someone was trying to kill him. Soon after, Peter met with the writers of his new movie and just as Daredevil noticed the scent of spirit gum and latex, Peter fell through a trap door. When he recovered, he discovered that the \"writers\" were all supervillains in disguise. Daredevil immediately jumped to defend Spider-Man but was soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of villains. Peter at first hesitated about fighting for real, but decided to join in the fray after seeing Daredevil getting beat nearly to death. Spider-Man defeated the villains one-by-one and unmasked the mastermind behind the attack as J. Jonah Jameson, who blamed Spider-Man for ruining his life. Realizing that Jameson was right, Spider-Man learned a harsh lesson about using his powers responsibly.[1]\nWithSpider-Army\nSpider-Man later recruited toSpider-Armyto oppose theInheritorsonEarth-000.[2]\nAfter the Inheritors were sent toEarth-3145, Spider-Man-80219 probably was sent back to his own reality with other Spiders.[3]"
