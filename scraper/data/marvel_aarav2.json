This, coupled with the fact that Death Metal's creator,Evelyn Necker-8410programmed Death Metal with the history of Earth-8410, made Charnel-9939 be aware of his defeat in the past, with him subsequently making plans to prevent his aforementioned defeat to preserve his timeline.\nHowever, before Charnel could accomplish his plans,Death³managed to defeat him, with Death Metal tearing his heart out as the other two kept him busy.\nShortly following Charnel's defeat, the chronal wave catched up to the year 2020 and this reality was finally erased out of existence.[4]\nMonica RappacciniofAIM-616discovered Earth-9939 as a timeline overwritten by time travel.

Her family was well-paid off, but Natasha's mother never stopped looking for her, which got her killed byGeneral Dreykov's men. Natasha was told that she was abandoned as an infant. She went on to become a spy before the age of six.[1]\nUndercover in Ohio\nFrom1993to1996, Natasha lived inOhioas part of the \"family\" providing cover forAlexeiandMelina, the only parents that she knew. In 1996 their cover was blown and the \"family\" had to flee toCuba, where Natasha and her \"sister\"Yelenawere assigned by General Dreykov to theRed Room Programand shipped back toRussia. Although both Natasha and Yelena fell within the 5% that survived the Red Room training, they became separated early on.[1]Dreykov put her under the supervision ofMadame Bwho managed the Red Room for him. Natasha consistently excelled at her training, becoming their star pupil, but would intentionally show inadequacy in order to not proceed to the graduation ceremony, sterilization. However, she eventually passed all her tests and was forced to undergo tubal ligation.[10][11]Her ruthless effectiveness in later years earned her the codename, \"Black Widow.\"[3]\nRed Room training\nThis life underwent a dramatic change when on a mission inBudapestshe was targeted for assassination herself, and the agent sent to kill her was the similarly gifted soldier,Clinton Barton. Instead of killing her, Barton spared her life and chose to recruit her intoS.H.I.E.L.D.instead. As part of her defection process, Romanoff sought to kill Dreykov. She used his young daughterAntoniato get to him and ordered Barton to detonate the explosives despite the girl being collateral. They brought down the five-story building Dreykov was in and Natasha believed both him and his daughter were dead. She and Barton were pursued by Hungarian Special Forces, spending two days hiding in a subway vent and 10 days in total just getting out of Budapest.[1]The pair developed a lasting partnership from that moment on, though the two would remember the details of the mission differently.[3]\nFollowing Barton, the Black Widow was drawn into a new life as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Her past, however, would remain a touchy subject for her, and Widow tried to start a new life. On several occasions, she cited a desire to atone for past deeds, which she described as being \"red on her ledger\" that she wanted to wipe out.[3]During a mission to escort a Nigerian scientist out ofIran, Romanoff was confronted by the ruthlessWinter Soldier, who eliminated his target by literally shooting through Romanoff when she tried to shield him, which left a small scar on her hip.[2]\nAgent Romanoff posing as \"Natalie Rushman\"\nYears later, Romanoff was taking down aTen Ringscell when S.H.I.E.L.D.Director Nick Furyreassigned her to infiltrateStark Industriesand to keep an eye onTony Starkafter he signed his company over toPepper Potts. Romanoff was also assigned by Fury to assess whether he was suitable for theAvengers Initiative, a plan to bring together a group of people with unparalleled talents.\nAfter some time spent undercover as Natalie Rushman in the Stark Industries Legal Department, Romanoff seized an opportunity to meet Stark by poisoning thesenior paralegalon her way to meet Stark.[12]She immediately caught the attention of Stark and Potts when she briskly took down Stark's bodyguardHappy Hoganin a playful sparring match. Stark ran a search on her and discovered that she was fluent in French, Russian, Latin; and had done some modeling inJapanat some point. Romanoff then became Tony's new assistant and accompanied him while he was inMonaco. She also flirted with him at his birthday party when he started to get suspicious about where she had come from.[7]\nWhen confronting Stark about his reckless behavior, Fury revealed to Stark her true name and affiliation. Despite this, he assured Stark that Romanoff would retain her undercover status in Stark's affairs to continue monitoring him as he worked on a cure for his palladium poisoning. The next night, Romanoff attended the Stark Expo, whereJustin HammerofHammer Advanced Weapons Systemsunveiled his newHammer Dronesand theWar Machine Armorworn byLt. Col. James Rhodes. Stark also arrived uninvited in his new and improvedIron Man Armorto warn Rhodes about an impending attack fromIvan Vanko. It was then that Vanko surprised everyone by remotely gaining control of both the Hammer Drones and the War Machine Armor. While Stark led the immediate threat of the machines away from the Expo, Potts and Romanoff confronted Hammer demanding to know Vanko's location. Romanoff put him in a neck lock, which forced him to reveal that Vanko was working remotely from his nearby facility.[7]\nRomanoff takes on Justin Hammer's security forces\nOnce at the site, Romanoff left Happy to deal with a lone security guard while she penetrated deep into the facility and systematically disabled many more of the security force. Vanko had already abandoned his control systems and left by the time Romanoff found them. She quickly restored control of the War Machine Armor to Rhodes and was also able to radio tactical data, warning Rhodes and Stark of an incoming wave of drones and another armored battlesuit, this one worn by Vanko.[7]She then proceeded to steal Hammer's development projects and fled before the police came to the facility, just as it exploded.[13]\nTwo days later, Fury assigned Romanoff to tail the fugitive scientistBruce Bannerbecause theagentpreviously assigned to the case had been redeployed toPuente Antiguo. She first came across Banner during the military siege atCulver University, where he transformed into the monstrous Hulk right before her.[14]Fury ordered her not to letGeneral Rosstake the Hulk into custody, but the Hulk's destructive force prevented her from doing anything more than report on his fight withCaptain Blonsky.[15]\nShe later followed Banner toHarlem,New Yorkto continue S.H.I.E.L.D.'s attempts to prevent Banner from being taken by the military. However, she had arrived too late as Ross had already taken Banner into custody. Fury sent her to meetDr. Samuel Sternsand make sure Banner left nothing he could work with. She found Sterns trapped under debris after an encounter with another big monster. His head had become grotesquely deformed and he began raving, which caused Romanoff to incapacitate him by shooting his kneecap.\nHaving caught a glimpse of the Hulk's highly destructive battle with the Abomination in the distance, she reported to Fury that the entire situation (involving not only the Hulk, but also Tony Stark's inventions and theAsgardians' arrival in Puente Antiguo) had become too much for S.H.I.E.L.D. to handle as it was.[14]\nPursuing missing Starktech, Romanoff was undercover in Moscow. She attempted to get information from illegal arms dealerMikhail Fjodorov, but he was assassinated right in front of her. She fled the scene when authorities accused and pursued her. Shortly after her escape, she was attacked byhired mercenarieswho put her in contact with \"Sofia,\" the mysterious woman who killed Fjodorov. Romanoff learned that she was a \"fan\" and that she wanted to claim the mantle of the \"Black Widow.\"[4]\nGoing off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar to pursue Sofia, Romanoff encountered her in person in Sochi. She was nearly killed by Sofia, but she was saved by Coulson. Coulson informed her that the missing Starktech had been located on a boat owned by Fjodorov's associates. Romanoff infiltrated the boat and met withAgent Markovto retrieve the tech, but Sofia beat her once again and killed Markov.[6]An enraged Romanoff managed to place a tracker on Sofia and followed it to aSojourn Enterprisesbuilding inVladivostok. Romanoff discovered Sofia was hired by Sojourn ownerRichard Frampton, who, along with Fjodorov, was in business with theTen Rings. She tracked them to a missile launch site near the Russian border. She confronted Sofia, who revealed she idolized the killer nature of the Black Widow ever since she was saved by her when she was 14. Resenting the now \"soft\" Black Widow, Sofia engaged Romanoff in combat but was ultimately killed in an explosion. Fury and other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrived to quell the situation.[16]\nAround a year later, Natasha was working deep undercover inAsia.[14]\nNot long after, while in the middle of interrogatingGeorgi Luchkov, Romanoff received a call from Agent Coulson informing her of her next mission. She was to approach Banner, who had retreated toCalcutta, and enlist his aid in locating theTesseract, a dangerous object that had been stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. by the AsgardianLoki, who had also taken Agent Barton. Even though the thought of Banner's immensely powerful alter ego terrified her, Romanoff carried out the assignment with aplomb and soon had Banner on board.[3]\nHer next assignment was to apprehend Loki withSteve Rogers(aka \"Captain America\"). The mission was successful, although it took the combined skills of Rogers, Tony Stark in his Iron Man armor, and Natasha herself at the gun controls of a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet to subdue him. On the return trip, they also encountered Loki's brotherThor, who had plans of his own to retrieve Loki and the Tesseract.[3]\nNatasha's skills as an interrogator made her a prime choice for extracting information from Loki once S.H.I.E.L.D. had him in custody. She adeptly tricked the trickster into revealing that Loki planned on releasing the Hulk on the team, although his manipulative responses had also hit their mark (citing unspecified incidents presumably from past missions involving Sao Paulo, the daughter of an individual named Dreykov and a hospital fire), and Romanoff became increasingly obsessive about finding restitution for her past. Foremost in these thoughts was her need to wrest Agent Barton from Loki's control, but she found that she didn't have to search. Instead, Barton, under Loki's control, came to them. Barton, leading a commando team against theS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, caused an explosion that collapsed part of the ceiling on Romanoff and Banner. This triggered Banner's transformation into the Hulk and rapidly escalated the problem of enemy infiltration to a chaotic two-front war, with Romanoff barely escaping the Hulk's ferocity with her life. During the chaos she also encountered Agent Barton, and engaged him in a lengthy brawling duel that only ended when blows to his head knocked him unconscious.[3]\nLoki's escape presented a fresh problem for the survivors of the attack. Romanoff attended to her old partner while others counted their losses, but she was quick to join them once they had resolved to go on the offensive. Following Loki toManhattan, Romanoff and the others were confronted by the sight of a huge dimensional rift above the city. Loki's army, a horde ofChitauriwarriors, came pouring through and Romanoff found herself again battling in close quarters, this time against an alien foe bent on world domination.[3]\nThe martial arts skills and small arms of the Black Widow were ideal for battling the Chitauri in the streets, and when her own weaponry was spent, she made good use of Chitauri armaments turned on their previous owners. Eventually she captured one of their aircraft and used it to reach the top ofStark Towerwhere she was instrumental in dealing with the device that held the portal open, thus sealing the rift and barring the amassed forces still waiting to pass through. When the battle was over, Romanoff gathered with the others to see off Thor and the captive Loki. The threat had been neutralized and for a time the world would have little need of its protectors. The others went their separate ways, while Romanoff and Barton returned to S.H.I.E.L.D.[3]\nCaptain America and Black Widow\nBlack Widow became a frequent comrade-in-arms of Captain America when they were assigned on missions together. They became the co-leaders of the counter-terrorist teamS.T.R.I.K.E.. On one mission, S.T.R.I.K.E. was able to prevent a terrorist group from releasing the Zodiac virus uponWillis TowerinChicago, due to Romanoff infiltrating the group weeks prior.[5]\nDuring one rescue mission of ahijacked S.H.I.E.L.D. ship, Nick Fury assigned Black Widow a secret side task to retrieve confidential protected S.H.I.E.L.D. files in a flash drive. The data was more sensitive than she could have guessed, and once it was handed over to Fury he became the target of an assassin. When Romanoff heard that Fury had been gunned down she went to the hospital to keep vigil, and watched helplessly as he was declared dead. Based on Steve's description of the shooter, she identified the killer as the Winter Soldier. After hiding details of Fury's death, Steve became a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D. under the orders ofSecretary Alexander Pierce. Natasha joined him to help him retrieve the confidential files from the flash drive, which Fury had already given to Rogers. Natasha tried to hack the protected files but could only discover the location from where they were created,Camp Lehigh.[2]\nOn the run from S.H.I.E.L.D.\nThere, Steve and Natasha discovered a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. base where the consciousness ofArnim Zolarevealed that after World War II, he had been recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D., and that he and other German scientists had furthered Hydra's plans for world domination through numerous projects, including the infiltration of and influence on S.H.I.E.L.D.. Romanoff interrupted Zola's lengthy exposition of Hydra's activities when her PDA alerted her to an incoming missile. She and Rogers narrowly escaped the resulting blast, and then left the scene before S.H.I.E.L.D. could find them. The following day, Steve and Natasha sought help fromSam Wilson, who they then pulled into their circle of allies by recovering a flight-exoskeleton for him. The trio then captured and interrogated Agent Sitwell to find out about the conspiracy festering within S.H.I.E.L.D. Under pressure, Sitwell revealed his allegiance to Hydra and that Hydra planned to useProject Insightto massacre the millions of people identified as threats to Hydra's new world order.[2]\nNatasha, Steve, and Sam were later attacked by the Winter Soldier and a team of Hydra double agents, led by their former S.T.R.I.K.E. teammateAgent Brock Rumlow. Natasha suffered a bullet wound to her shoulder while trying to elude the Winter Soldier, and Steve was left stunned by the revelation that the Winter Soldier was his old friend Bucky Barnes. With the fight taken out of them, the three heroes were easily captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., but while being transported under guard they were rescued by a disguisedAgent Maria Hillwho brought them to a hideout where Nick Fury was alive and recuperating. Fury revealed a plan to prevent Pierce from launching Project Insight, involving the replacement of the controller chip of each one of the helicarriers.[2]\nNatasha infiltrated theTriskeliondisguised asCouncilwoman Hawleyof theWorld Security Counciland was taken hostage with the other councillors by Pierce as soon as Captain America revealed over the public address system the truth about Hydra controlling S.H.I.E.L.D., and Pierce being their leader. Black Widow eventually dropped her cover and subdued Pierce. She then revealed Nick Fury's survival, and forced Pierce to help Fury release the secrets of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra to the public, as two top-level agents were required to do so. As the files were being uploaded, Pierce activated devices in the security badges of the rest of the Security Council, which killed them. He then attempted to use Natasha for leverage to escape, but she used a micro-EMP device on herself, disabling the badge, and giving time for Fury to shoot Pierce, killing him. The two then escaped the Triskelion in a helicopter to rescue, also rescuing Sam when a helicarrier crashed into the building.[2]\nNatasha later appeared before a Senate subcommittee, in which she defended the dismantling of S.H.I.E.L.D. When asked by military officials as to why they shouldn't imprison her for the newly-revealed crimes that she had committed against the U.S., she responded that people like her were needed to defend the world. She later approached Fury's \"grave\" to say goodbye to Steve, stating that with all of her covers blown, she had to find a new identity. She encouraged him to romantically pursueAgent 13before passing him a dossier on the Winter Soldier.[2]\nWith the dissolution of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Loki's Scepter, which had been in the midst of so much conflict during theBattle of New York, fell into the hands of Hydra'sBaron Strucker, and Romanoff soon rejoined her Avengers teammates in trying to recover it. During this time, she developed a particular connection with Bruce Banner, to the extent that she came to develop the 'Lullaby' system, where she would calm the Hulk down after the immediate mission had been concluded so that he could return to Bruce Banner. Their mission took them to Strucker's Hydra research base inSokoviawhere the alien device had been used in experiments to create enhanced soldiers. Romanoff herself helped fight a multitude of Hydra soldiers outside the base while Tony Stark penetrated the old castle and recovered the scepter.[10]\nFresh from victory, the Avengers returned to the newly remodeledAvengers Towerin New York and threw a party to celebrate. Late in the evening when most of the guests had gone home, the men tested their worthiness trying to lift Mjolnir, but each of them were unsuccessful. The game was interrupted when one of Tony Stark'sIron Legionrobots made a surprise appearance, and after admitting that it was the result of Stark'sUltronprogram mixed with his research into the scepter, it and several more like it, attacked the group. Romanoff took cover behind the wet bar and drew a pistol concealed there to help with the fight, interrupted briefly at one point to drag Dr. Banner in after her. The attack was a diversion however, and one of the robots made off with the scepter while the Avengers and their friends were engaged in battle.[10]\nWhen reports of robots attacking sources ofVibraniumbegan surfacing, the Avengers raced to a coastal scrapyard inAfricawhere Stark believed that a substantial quantity of the rare metal might be stored. They arrived shortly after Ultron and its two enhanced allies, twinsWandaandPietro Maximoff. A fight broke out with the Avengers trying to stop Ultron taking Vibranium from the site, and Romanoff found herself incapacitated by Wanda's power to instil nightmare visions. She languished in a scene from her childhood while the fight carried on around her and the enemy made their escape. Still haunted by the ghosts of her past, Romanoff had a welcome respite when Barton took the group to his farm, and the laughter of his two children welcoming their \"Aunty Natasha\" helped to wash away her troubles. She also had time to speak privately with Banner and discuss their feelings for each other, even suggesting that they could depart together, but Banner was quick to point out that there was nowhere that she could be safe with him. Nick Fury also arrived at the farm and spoke with the group at length about stopping Ultron.[10]\nAfter Banner made the observation that Ultron was trying to evolve, the remaining Avengers split into two groups with Black Widow joining Captain America and Hawkeye in a bid to stop Ultron from obtaining cellular regeneration technology inSouth Korea. The trio raced for their objective, and found that Ultron's plan to create a new android body for itself were already well underway, but the Avengers' arrival caused it to grab the body and flee. Barton located Ultron escaping in a truck trailer in heavy traffic, and when a window of opportunity presented itself Romanoff dropped to the streets on a motorcycle to pursue it herself. She and Rogers managed to jointly fend off a number of Ultron sentries, and although Romanoff was successful in delivering the dormant android to Barton, she was captured by the robots shortly thereafter.[10]\nWhen she awoke, Romanoff found that she had been transported back to Sokovia, where Ultron made a show of demonstrating his latest upgrade before confining her to a cell. She turned to using old Cold War-era communication techniques in a bid to expose her location without being detected, but could do little else but sit and wait. Barton did indeed receive her signal, and eventually she was treated to the welcome sight of Bruce Banner sneaking in alone to free her while the other Avengers, and their new allies, made a show of confronting Ultron outside. Romanoff forced Banner's transformation, and then they too joined the fight to stop the robot.[10]\nThe Avengers fought hard to break the ranks of Ultron's amassed robot force in the Sokovian city. As the battle wound down, Romanoff and Barton turned their attention to evacuating the civilian populace, but soon she received the call to \"sing a lullaby\" to the Hulk, and calm him back to his more human state. Her calming technique was interrupted by Ultron, at the controls of the Avengers' very own quintet, raking the Hulk with gunfire. The Hulk grabbed Romanoff and bore her to safety on a newly arrived S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier before leaping after Ultron to vent his rage. Romanoff soon learned that the Hulk had won over Ultron in the departing quintet and appealed to him through a video link to disengage the plane's stealth technology, but the Hulk simply severed the connection.[10]\nAfter Ultron's defeat, the Avengers returned to New York. Abandoning the city, they began setting up anew basein Upstate New York for a significantly restructured team, after several Avengers chose to either retire or depart Earth. Romanoff- although mourning Bruce's departure- joining Rogers in welcoming the four new Avengers - Sam Wilson, Col. James Rhodes, Wanda Maximoff, and theVision.[10]\nWhile working with the new Avengers, Natasha took a particular role in training Wanda in tactical observation, which Wanda attempted to put into practice as the Avengers tracked Brock Rumlow, who had managed to survive the fall of the Triskelion and was looking for revenge upon Captain America. Going by the alias \"Crossbones\", Rumlow attacked a research lab inNigeria. Although Widow and the other Avengers were able to stop him stealing a biological weapon, Rumlow triggered his suicide vest, and Wanda's action of throwing him away from Rogers resulted in the destruction of a building and the death of twelve members of a Wakandan outreach program.[17]\nThe following month, Thaddeus Ross (now Secretary of State) and Tony visited the Avengers base to inform them of the Sokovia Accords, a U.N. legislation that would make the Avengers directly answerable to government authority. Steve openly opposed the documents, while Tony didn't dismiss the idea of regulation. To the surprise of the team, Natasha sided with Tony. Opinions on the Accords divided the team, but before they could argue any further, the team was notified that founding member of S.H.I.E.L.D.Peggy Carterhad passed away. Natasha attended the funeral because she felt that Steve needed comforting.[17]\nBy the time the leaders of the world coming together inViennafor a ratification of the Accords, Natasha, Tony, Rhodey, and Vision had signed to abide by the accords. At Vienna, Natasha briefly conversed withKing T'ChakaofWakandaand his sonT'Challabefore the assembly began. The assembly was interrupted due to a bombing which killed several people, including King T'Chaka, with the Winter Soldier being named as the apparent perpetrator. Following the explosion, Natasha attempted to console T'Challa, but T'Challa was firm when he declared that he was going to kill the Winter Soldier himself. Similarly, Steve expressed his desire to bring Barnes in personally, to which Natasha tried to persuade him against the decision.[17]\nNatasha, along with Tony and Rhodey, reported for duty under the orders ofEverett Rossand theJoint Counter Terrorist CentreinGermany. Steve, T'Challa (who had assumed the mantle of the Black Panther), Barnes, and Sam were soon apprehended and detained to the facility. Natasha was watching Barnes' interrogation when suddenly, the facility went through a complete loss of power. Barnes escaped his cell, so Natasha, Tony, T'Challa, and Agent Sharon Carter tried to prevent him from escaping, but they were unsuccessful. Natasha and Tony soon learned that Steve and Sam escaped along with Barnes. Tony requested for 48 hours from Secretary Ross to bring Steve in peacefully, before agencies started treating him as a fugitive.[17]\nTony decided to assemble his team with Natasha. He needed to travel toQueens,New Yorkfor the final member, while Natasha recruited King T'Challa, who still intended on killing Barnes himself. Tony's team, which comprised Natasha, War Machine, Vision, the Black Panther, and an enhanced teenager known asSpider-Man, took toLeipzig/Halle Airportand confronted Captain America, who had assembled his own team of enhanced individuals, which included the Winter Soldier, Falcon, Wanda Maximoff, an enhanced individual who went under the alias ofAnt-Man, and Hawkeye, whom they brought out of retirement.[17]\nTony and Natasha initially tried to reason with Steve, but a fight soon broke out between the two groups. The battle was evenly matched at first, but as it progressed, it became clear that Steve's allies were losing. Ant-Man, had the capability to shift the density of his molecules, which allowed him to grow to an enormous size. With Iron Man's team momentarily shocked and distracted, Steve and Barnes used the opportunity to make their escape on a quinjet. Black Panther chased after them, but Natasha attacked him before he could prevent their escape. Tony confronted her later at the Avengers Facility, from where she departed to go in hiding.[17]\nNatasha had her old contactRick Masonset her up with an off-the-grid cabin inNorwayand a bunch of new fake identities. However, before she could lie low, she was attacked byTaskmaster, who was after a package from her old safe house in Budapest. Outmatched in the fight, Natasha managed to escape with the vials, which had a on photo of herself and Yelena in them. Still on the run from Ross, Natasha found Yelena in Budapest and learned from her that Dreykov was not dead as she assumed and that the Red Room was still fully operational. Determined to free the rest of the trainees from the chemical conditioning but lacking the means to locate theRed Room Academy, Yelena and Natasha broke Alexei out of theSiberianprison, who in turn led them toMelina, resulting in their \"family\" reuniting for the first time in 20 years.[1]\nAs part of the plan to bring down the Red Room, they were captured and taken to the floating Academy that served as Dreykov's headquarters. Natasha and Melina switched places using aPhotostatic Veil, expecting Dreykov to see through it eventually. Dreykov revealed that a pheromonal block prevented her from harming him and revealed to Natasha that the Taskmaster was in fact his daughter whom Romanoff blamed herself for murdering and send Taskmaster to deal with other saboteurs while occupying himself with Romanoff. After provoking him into hitting her in the face had no effect, Romanoff broke her own nose, counteracting the pheromone block. Meanwhile, Melina blew one of the engines which destabilized the structure, forcing everyone to make a frantic escape. Natasha downloaded the files on the Widows, while Yelena used the existing antidote to free those present in the Red Room. Dreykov was escorted to an aircraft, but Belova risked her life to blow up its engine, causing the entire craft to crash and killing Dreykov in an explosion. She was rescued by Natasha who, after making the successful landing, said goodbye to her family and tasked them with replicating the antidote and freeing the rest of the Widows across the world.[1]\nTwo weeks later, after Natasha's mission was already over, Mason was finally able to deliver to her a proper S.H.I.E.L.D.Quinjet. Natasha decided to use it to locate Steve Rogers and help him rescue the Avengers imprisoned in the Raft.[1]She reunited with Steve and the other Avengers, and continued fighting terrorism from the shadows.[18]\nTwo years later, Natasha was contacted by Steve to help Wanda and the Vision. Arriving inScotland, Natasha, Steve, and Sam saved Wanda and Vision from aliens known asProxima MidnightandCorvus Glaive. Taking Wanda and a badly injured Vision with them, the group returned to Avengers base, violating the Sokovia Accords. The group encountered Banner, who had been sent from deep space to warn the Avengers that an alien warlordThanoswas looking for the Mind Stone in Vision's head. Natasha and the rest of the team departed for safe haven in Wakanda.[19]\nAt Wakanda, while T'Challa's sisterShuriworked to extract the Mind Stone from Vision, Natasha helped the Avengers and Wakandans fend offThanos's forces, even helping Wanda andOkoyebattle Proxima. Their efforts were ultimately in vain, as Thanos himself arrived, killed Vision, and retrieved the Mind Stone, which allowed him to snap half of the universe's population away through the use of theInfinity Gauntlet. Natasha was one of the survivors.[19]\nWhile taking stock of the casualties on Earth, the Avengers encounteredCarol Danverswhen they were investigating a mysterious pager Nick Fury had on him when he died.[20]Not long after, Danvers rescued Tony andNebulafrom outer space. Pooling together all the information they had on the Mad Titan, Natasha and the Avengers tracked down Thanos to his hiding spot in theGarden. They hoped to get theInfinity Stonesand bring back the fallen. When they arrived, they learned that Thanos had destroyed the stones, which led Thor to kill Thanos in rage.[21]\nOver the next five years, Natasha led the Avengers in reforming the world after the snap. Aware that Clint, who had lost his family to Thanos, had become a vigilante, she often sent Rhodey to look for him, to no avail. One day, while casually conversing back at headquarters, Steve and Natasha were surprised by the sudden appearance of Scott Lang, who was believed to be one of the fallen, at their front door. Scott, who was trapped in the Quantum Realm for five years but experienced it in five hours, proposed that the Avengers could travel through time using the Quantum Realm to retrieve the stones.[21]\nAccepting the idea, the Avengers decided to experiment. Tony, who had started a family, was unwilling to go through the idea, while Bruce, who had since merged his mind with the Hulk's body, accepted the idea. After Banner's tests failed, Tony (having changed his mind) arrived and perfected time-travel. Meanwhile, Natasha went to Japan, where she convinced the rogue Clint that there was still a way to save his family.[21]\nWith the Avengers reassembled and Clint's testing of time travel successful, the team brainstormed a way to get the Infinity Stones across time. The team spent months going over appearances of the Infinity Stones throughout history. Traveling to2014, Natasha and Clint went toVormirfor theSoul Stone, where they met theStonekeeper, who explained that the Avengers needed to sacrifice someone dear to them for the Stone. Though Natasha wanted to sacrifice herself due to her past, Clint wanted to sacrifice himself to save his family. The two battled each other to be the sacrifice but ultimately Natasha sacrificed herself for the Soul Stone. The grieving Barton returned to 2023, where the team was able to unite the Stones and bring the fallen back to life.[21]\nNatasha Romanoff is a high level trained combatant and S.H.I.E.L.D. operative. She is fluent in multiple languages including Russian, Italian, and Latin. She also possesses high level computer training and psychologist training. She is deceptively strong, though not superhuman.

However, attacking black holes caused the Unmaker to be corrupted and began attacking whole galaxies. This came to the attention of theLiving Tribunalwho stopped the Unmaker. Too powerful to be simply eliminated, the Living Tribunal deactivated the Unmaker and sealed it into the core of the newly developedEarth.\nDuring the modern era, the Unmaker awakened and began attempting to break out of the Earth, threatening to destroy the entire planet in the process. After theWatchertold Earth's heroes of the Unmaker, they came up with a plan to stop the Unmaker.Vision,Scarlet Witch, theThing,Invisible Woman, andDoctor Strangewere chosen to go to Earth's core to stop the Unmaker while the other heroes did their best to mitigate the damage the Unmaker was doing to the surface. The Unmaker easily kill Thing and Scarlet Witch. After witnessing Scarlet Witch's death, Vision angrily phased through Unmaker's head, buying the heroes a few extra seconds. Strange was able to finally stop the Unmaker by opening a portal to another dimension that released an EMP that put an end to it. However, Unmaker fatally injured Strange. Before dying, Strange saved Invisible Woman by sending her back to the surface. Because he died, Strange didn't get the chance to close the portal he opened, unintentionally unleashing an EMP that wiped out every electronic device on Earth.[1]\nThe EMP along with the destruction the Unmaker inflicted upon the surface caused various wars to break out for different reasons, including ideology, resources, and borders. All these situations led to the deaths of billions. To stop the fighting, various heroes interceded and asked those who were fighting to find a better way to settle things. Eventually, society began rebuilding itself over the next 7 years. People fled the most inhospitable places and lived in communities. Various geniuses gathered together inWakandato develop new innovations to create a post-apocalyptic utopia. A network of telepaths helped the places of the world connect and communicate with one another. With electronic lighting wiped out, werewolves and vampires attacked frequently. So, weblines were used to alert people when they attacked, allowing defenders to take care of them.\nThe only place not free wasEurope, which was taken over by the villainous mutantApocalypse. Apocalypse had sensed the power of the Unmaker and wanted to reawaken it for his own needs. To do this, he enlisted the help from thePurple Manto brainwash the world's greatest geniuses to work for him, includingReed Richards,Riri Williams, andTony Stark. He also forcibly turned the mutantMagnetointo an electromagnet to counter the EMP.[2]\nThe world's heroes suspected Apocalypse was up to something after he forcibly kidnapped Tony Stark.Quicksilverwas sent to investigate Apocalypse's operations and discovered the geniuses being forced to serve Apocalypse. He also discovered his father Magneto being forced to be an electromagnet and tried to save him but was thwarted. He was then brainwashed by the Purple Man to attack his allies and killedOkoyeandHuman Torchbefore being subdued. Quicksilver then revealed what he learned to his allies.[3]"

TheAvengersare taken to the concentration camps, except for Captain America who is kept around to witness the destruction of Earth. He ordered the use of the Omni-Wave Annihilator, a weapon that not even the Supreme Intelligence dared use and which generations of Kree refused to use.

Within seconds, the planet was consumed by flames billions of degrees hotter than that of a star.\nSoon afterwards, theKreedid the same to theShi'ar Empire, destroying their homeworld.Iron ManandGoliathwere now hunted down as terrorists by the Kree vowing to continue the fight, to save 1000s of other worlds from the same fate. Iron Man created a diversion outside while Goliath infiltrated the prison using Pym particles, and switched places with Captain America.

Several days later, with the help of the Kree Underground Resistance, Captain America freed the remaining Avengers from the concentration camp.Sersiand Hercules their lives and took out the camp while giving Captain America, the Black Knight, Cystal, and the Kree rebels time to escape. Kree warships intercepted them, only to be destroyed byQuasarand the Shi'ar dreadnoughts that came out of a warpgate. On board the warships were the remnants of theShi'ar Imperial Guardand the Avengers who had been tasked to go to the Shi'ar throneworld but never made it there. Captain America then vowed that the Kree Empire would go down.[1]\nSeveral years after the Kree's victory over the Shi'ar and the destruction of Earth, the Kree dominated six sectors of space. Any resistance they encountered was brutally crushed. It was a genocidal fascist empire that had exterminated 1000s of \"genetically unfit\" races and 1000s more faced extinction, and in their prison camps were those who opposed their rule including both theSkrullsand rebellious Kree. Galaxies squirmed and pleaded for mercy under the boot of Kree oppression. Ruling the empire was the mad emperor, Ael-Dan. Keeping what little hope remained alive where a band of rumored and rarely seen heroes, freedom fighters made up of survivors of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard and the Avengers. Within the Kree Empire, even the Kree are oppressed by Ael-Dan's regime, overseen by \"Morale Officers\". Citizens are often forced to go without food, as the resources of the empire are devoted to the ever growing military-industrial complex.\nThe freedom fighters infiltrated a remote lunar Kree base, and stole billions of gigabytes of data, though at the cost of Smasher who gave his life to cover their escape and of the Black Knight who died from his wounds en route back to the Avengers' secret base. In addition Vision was gone, as the data storage units they stole were too badly damaged, therefore he volunteered to have the data overwrite his mind. Using the stolen data, a fleet of warships made up of the remnants of the once mighty fleets of those races that had been conquered by the Kree headed toward Hala in a desperate attempt to overthrow the Kree regime. Leading them were the Avengers and assisting them were Fifth columnists within the Kree military. Greatly outnumbered it appears the fleet would be destroyed when out of a warp gate \"Space Patrol\" emerged, a force of superhumans led by Quasar (and including the Silver Surfer, Firelord, Nova, the Super Skrull, and others) and joined battle against the Kree fleet. Another team of Avengers infiltrated Kree airspace via a small dropship from which they bailed out of before it crashed into the Citadel of Judgement. Thor in turn led an Asgardian force into Hala via a portal, joining the battle."

Finding two children fighting each other in the castle's training grounds, Natasha was reminded of her past and vowed to never again allow children to be turned into weapons. Natasha spotted a caged dinosaur and set up explosives next to its cage. She then revealed herself to an Elite Hand Ninja and detonated the explosives, freeing the T-Rex. The monster wreaked havoc and took down the Hand's forces. Before it could endanger the child recruits, Black Widow mounted the dinosaur and electrocuted it. The Elite Hand Ninja ordered the children to leave and confronted Black Widow, but he and his subordinates were defeated. Investigating a suspicious wall sculpture, Natasha opened a secret passage leading her to the Hand Ninja Castle, where she defeated more elite ninjas. The Hand's child recruits standing in front of the castle prepared to confront Natasha, when to her surprise, she was approached by The Hand's leader,Daredevil. He told her that the planet has become a savage place that wasn't safe beyond the walls of the castle, and assured that the children could only survive if they become warriors. After Black Widow put Daredevil in the ropes, the children stepped between him and Black Widow. Matt decided to let them decide whether to stay or not, and the children followed him back into the castle despite Natasha's pleas.

        "content": "Home to Guardians of the Galaxy 31st CenturyGalleryOfficial NameEarth-691[22]StatusExistingCreators and AppearancesCreatorsArnold Drake,Gene ColanFirstMarvel Super-Heroes#18(October, 1968)\nOn Saturday, June 29, 1901, theMartian Masterslaunched an invasion of Earth that since became known as the first War of the Worlds. Though man's most powerful weapons proved useless against the Martians with their mechanical tripods and heat rays, the invaders were brought down by terrestrial bacteria. In the aftermath, the event was fictionalized through a novelization and a disinformation campaign.[1](On Earth-616 the first invasion took place in about 1907, but was hushed up to prevent market panic. There was another attempted invasion in 1917.[2])\nThe economic depression of the 1970s, with a constantly rising cost of living, marked the rapid deterioration of western civilization. Rather than encouraging the populace to reduce the rapid consumption at the heart of the depression, world leaders opted instead for the rapid proliferation of nuclear fission plants to power more factories to produce more inferior goods from quickly-dwindling natural resources. The aerosol industry, for example, grew to an enormous three billion dollar a year industry in the 1970s, though scientists warned that the gas in the cans would break down the world's ozone layer. The public, however, refused to listen, at least until the first skin cancer epidemic of 1982. It became so deadly to be out in the sun that protective clothing was needed simply to cross the street.[3]\nDivergence fromEarth-616definitely occurred by the early 1980s.[4]All non-essential funding was shifted to bionics, primarily in an effort to find replacements for limbs destroyed by cancerous sunlight. Farms were moved indoors, and the use of hydroponics to cultivate food stocks from chemicals began to slowly edge out more natural farming methods. Traditional schooling methods were supplanted in favor of pre-recorded, audio-visual lessons undergone at the student's pace in individual cubicles, while teachers did little more than change the tapes. The mural-phonics system, which allowed the audience to see, hear, and even experience the sensations of its subjects through virtual-reality helmets, became the dominant entertainment medium. Militarily, the superpowers continued to research and construct nuclear and biological weapons. A lunar base was established, and at least one mission was successfully landed on Mars. Before the majority of its funding was diverted to bionics research,NASAlaunchedProject Starjump-- an effort to launch a single human, whose life would be prolonged by periodically-interrupted cryogenic suspension, toBeta Centauri IV-- as its last major effort in 1988, with MajorVance Astroas the pilot.[citation needed]\nBy this time theBionics Wars-- vast mobilizations ofcyborgarmies competing for scarce resources and food stocks -- were already raging across the globe. In 1995, a thermonuclear reactor -- one of the many fusion reactors embraced by nations and corporations after 1993, despite popular opposition -- exploded as a result of cyborg fighting. The resulting explosion rendered WesternCanadauninhabitable, and worldwide public outcry threatened a massive revolution if the nations could not end the senseless violence. The Bionics Wars formally ended in that same year with the signing of theTreaty of Pekingand the formation of the firstConfederation of Nations. By the late 1990s, high-speed transbelt conveyors became the primary mode of overland shipping and travel. Even more sophisticated artificial reality and sensation systems were developed:Cinderellawas re-released in a sensory-stimulating version in 1996, and the octo-tympanum-viewscope -- a fully-immersing system which combined musical tracks with solid-holographic imagery and emotional stimulation -- was developed in 1998.[citation needed]\nIn 1999, anti-mutanthysteria gripped the world and led to the construction of an army of upgraded, highly powerfulSentinels. The Sentinels decimated the mutant population, killing many in what would become known as theGreat Injustice.Namorconclusively ended the Great Injustice by sending the Sentinels to a watery end.[5]In the aftermath, a band of mutants underMagneto's leadership, known as theX-Iles, abandoned Earth to escape destruction. The group first settled onJupiter's moonEuropa, establishing a city under the northern magnetic pole, but eventually left the Sol system for the planetHaven.[5].  At around the same time in 1999, an astronaut was sent on a manned flight to Mars without proper shielding, and was affected by the cosmic rays.  He returned to Earth through unknown means and remained in a coma-like state at the Miami Museum of Cultural Development.[6]\nOn the night of June 29, 2001, the Martians launched Attack II, the second attempt to invade the Earth. The Martians' initial assault simultaneously destroyed all human stockpiles of nuclear arms, assuring that not one nuclear weapon would be fired in the course of the war. By morning, the Martians had begun dismantling transportation systems. Terran forces used biological weapons against the invaders, only to discover that they had developed a general-purpose immunity. While the Martians sought to keep as many humans alive as possible for food, labor, and entertainment, the biological weapons deployed during the assault killed or mutated many. Armies conducted counter-attacks, and civilians either rose in defense or fled. The second assault -- skirmishes with pockets of resistance, civilian freedom fighters, and remainingSuper Heroessuch asCaptain AmericaandSpider-Man-- lasted into 2006, but the initial assault had been so devastating that the event soon became known as the One Night War.[citation needed]\nLed by a powerfulHigh Overlord, the Martian Masters enslaved most of the population, as labor in converting Terran edifices to new uses, guards for their fortresses, or even as simple cattle. Some were drafted as gladiators to fight for the Martian Masters' amusement, while others were trained as Exterminators to hunt down the last freemen threatening Martian rule. The Martians were particularly interesting in co-opting scientists, many of whom becameKeepers, collaborators responsible for overseeing their fellow humans. In 2014, the gladiatorKillravenescaped from captivity and soon became the leader of a particularly troublesome band of freemen. Along the way, Killraven would also team up with Earth-616'sSpider-Manin 2019.[7]Despite any hopes humanity held for a savior, the Martian force would not depart until 2075, having finally depleted Earth's resources.[citation needed]\nWith the Martians gone, humanity was free, but barbarous. Societies soon formed around independent city-states ruled bytechno-barons, who controlled the fruits of scientific progress. In 2188, one such techno-baron namedIsaac Harkovdeveloped a theoretical means of faster-than-light travel. For the most part, though, the techno-barons fought among themselves for territory and other prizes. At some point, the serfs rebelled against the techno-barons, refusing to fight for possession of the Moon. By 2525,Kwaal, the last of the techno-barons, was killed by the serfs.[citation needed]\nIn 2850, Harkov's texts resurfaced, and in 2900, the fuel necessary to implement Harkov's theory of faster-than-light travel was found in quantity atMercury's core, and dubbed \"harkovium\". By this time, humanity had spread to several planets within the Sol system, using genetic engineering to modify humans to survive in the harsh environments ofMercury, Jupiter, andPluto. Humans engineered to withstand extreme heat and light operated the mining colony on Mercury. Massive, dense humans were engineered to surviveJoviangravity. Humans were altered into a crystalline, silicon-based form to survive on the manufacturing colony ofPluto. UninhabitableVenusbecame home to thermo-electric plants which transmitted power to Earth and its lunar colony via laser relays. In 2908, the first Harkovian star-ship,Andromeda, was constructed, but lost on its maiden voyage. In 2940 a fleet was launched for the Alpha Centauri trinary star system. There, humans established their first friendly contact with an alien race: blue-skinned, pre-industrial beings on the planet Centauri IV, a planet orbiting the Beta Centauri star. In 3000, Earth, its colonies, and Centauri IV joined as equals under theUnited Federation of Earth. In 3006,Vance Astro's ship (all attempts to reach him before this point having failed) finally reached the Alpha Centauri system, where he was dismayed to learn faster-than-light travel had rendered his mission pointless.[citation needed]\nIn 3007, the peace was shattered by the invadingBrotherhood of Badoon. The Badoon completely destroyed the human colonies, killing all. On the final push for Earth, the Badoon easily overwhelmed the inferior fleet of theUnited Lands of Earth, and killed and enslaved millions as they conquered the planet. Guided by the unseen hand ofStarhawk, a sole survivor from each colony, along with Vance Astro, sole survivor of the twentieth century, banded together to resist the Badoon as theGuardians of the Galaxy. Eventually, the Sisterhood of Badoon traveled to Earth to take the males into custody. With the Badoon gone, the Guardians found that Earth offered little for them,[8]and re-dedicated the group as an interstellar enterprise, primarily funded by the sale of historical docu-chips Vance made of the group's time-traveling encounters with beings from the Age of Heroes, such as theAvengers. Among their many adventures was the \"Shield Quest\", in which the team (at Vance's urging) followed rumor, myth, and legend to ultimately find the long-lostshield of Captain America.[citation needed]\nSometime laterThe Spotof Earth-616 came to this reality where he gave hiscounterparthis abilities before killing this reality's Ohnn to further empower himself, afterward Ohnn left. Right after, the Spider-Man of Earth-616 and theSpider-ManofEarth-1048came to this reality where they were greeted by the deceased corpse of this reality's Spot. The 2 Spider-Men were then attacked by aSkorpsmanand defeated it with the help of Killraven. The Spider-Man of Earth-616 was happy to see Killraven again while the Spider-Man of Earth-1048 was horrified by the state of this reality, Spider-Man of Earth-616 quickly explained what happened in this reality to his 1048 counterpart. However 1048 thinking of his reality'sfriendsandlovedoneshe asked to see if they were still alive.[9]"

There he found human-mutant relations in utter chaos: His ownX-Menfractured,Havokbrainwashed,ColossusandDazzleramnesiac,Muir Islandunder the influence of theShadow King, and a group known as theMutant Liberation Frontcommitting terrorist acts across the world.\nXavier called a meeting between the X-Men,X-Factor,Excalibur, and theNew Mutants, telling them that they had all fallen apart. Newly appoint New Mutants leaderCabletook offence to this and told Xavier that times had changed and the X-Men needed to take a harder line on their enemies. Xavier admonished Cable, calling him a worse threat thanMagneto, and ordering him removed from stewardship of the New Mutants. This was met by protests from the New Mutants and ultimately a fight between them and the X-Men, ending with the New Mutants escaping. Contacting Cable telepathically, Xavier swore he would wrest back control of the New Mutants from him, and Cable responded by telling him that he was ready to go to war with Xavier if that was what it would come to. Shortly thereafter while Xavier was meeting withCyclopsandMarvel Girl, Cable assassinated them with a bomb, killing all three.\nAt the funeral,Wolverineswore vengeance on Cable and vowed to kill him in retribution for murdering Xavier, whileStormbelieved that Cable should be brought to justice, not murdered. This clash of ideologies lead to the remaining members of the X-Men picking sides.Forge,Colossus,Beast,Strong Guy, and others joined Storm; whilePsylocke,Havok,Archangel,Iceman, andJubileejoined Wolverine.\nWith the death of Xavier, many of the X-Men's foes capitalized on it to strike back at their enemies. Storm's X-Men were caught up trying to stop aGenoshanincursion on the United States;Apocalypsetargeted theScarlet Witch, leading to a battle with theAvengers;Fenrisattacked New York City; and theMutant Liberation Frontattacked theFantastic Four. Worsening human sentiment towards mutants resulted in them targeting theMorlocksleading to many being slain andFreedom Forcebeing charged with forcing them back underground. While in theSavage Land,Zaladaneand herSavage Land Mutateswarred on the world to expand the borders of the Savage Land. Other countries were also destabilized by anti-mutant hysteria;Gideonand theExternalsbegan taking advantage of the violence;Mr. Sinisterdispatched hisNasty Boysto collect the CEOs ofRoxxon Oil, the P.T.L. Club, and the Boy Scouts of America;Sebastian Shaw, fearing the worst, began talks with the President of the United States to restart Project: Wide-Awake.\nMeanwhile, Wolverine's team of X-Men tracked down Cable and the New Mutants. In the ensuing battle, Wolverine ultimately killed Cable who died telling him that Xavier was a better man than Wolverine because he had the strength of his convictions and didn't let his emotions blindly cloud his mind from the mission. Wolverine failed to understand the meaning of this. The Mutant Liberation Front next attacked the remains of the X-Mansion, leading to a clash with Storm's X-Men, but they soon retreated. The X-Men were next attacked by Zaladane and her Mutates, leading to the deaths of Beast, Nightcrawler, andPolaris, and ending with the X-Men fleeing their base. Watching this destruction was Magneto, who decided this was the time to try and unite mutantkind.[2]\nMagneto eventually killed Stryfe, taking over the Mutant Liberation Front, and began accepting other disenfranchised mutants into his army, including members from both Wolverine and Storm's ranks. Magneto launched an attack on Washington D.C., clashing with many of Earth's non-mutant heroes including the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. As Storm's group mourned their losses, Wolverine's team eliminated Mr. Sinister's Nasty Boys, prompting Psylocke to leave and find Storm's group.\nMagneto's group won a victory, taking Washington D.C., however the ousted President of the United States then activated the Sentinels, unleashing them upon America. The Sentinels were easily held at bay by Magneto's magnetic powers, however they cut across the country eliminating mutants and other super-human threats that resisted capture. Those who were captured were put in internment camps. The Fantastic Four, New Warriors, and Savage Land Mutates were all be wiped out. Wolverine's group was decimated, with Havok and Archangel killed and Iceman captured. Wolverine escaped, vowing to get revenge, while Storm and Psylocke joined Magneto's group for sanctuary."

In response to this threat, the organizationS.T.R.I.K.E.had sentSpider-Manand a SHIELD agent to hunt down Kingpin's mercenaries and stop him from sending inter-dimensional orbs to Ultimus. Assisted byLuke CageandPunisher, the team manage to stop the orbs from being sent through a portal, stopping Ultimus from getting his hands on the heroes.\nCrossbones, who had been defeated by the team before, had been double-crossed by Hydra and Ultimus. Because of this betrayal, he joined STRIKE to get some payback.Elektrawas being framed by one of Ultimus' imposters, and joined STRIKE to stop her imposter and the big bad.\nWith multiple heroes on their side, the team of heroes traveled far and wide to stop multiple invasions by Ultimus before recovering the pieces of an interdimensional portal. They headed behind enemy lines to gather intel and returned back with their information. Receiving a distress call from another universe'sCaptain America, they were sent after a version ofHulkto retrieve a cure for Ultimus' conversion. Retrieving it, they were finally sent with Thor to find the various keys to unlock the tomb of their universe's Ard-Con, who joined forces with them to take down the enemy.\nWhile the heroes were out on their quest, the villains of the world rescued the Kingpin from a corrupt SHIELD base. They were then tasked with taking over the Hand, destroying Ultron's armies, and uniting Hydra and A.I.M with SHIELD. With the task of uniting all villainous teams finished, a covert operation was launched to assassinate the 5 leaders of Ultimus' fallen dimension, slowing his momentum in the Nexus. Their final operation was to infiltrate a dimension controlled by corrupted versions ofStar-Lordto retrieve Ultimus' power source, the Ego Seed.\nWith their dimension's Ard-Con on their side and Ultimus' power diminishing, shocking news was received: Nick Fury was kidnapped by Ultimus and was to be corrupted. After being rescued, Ultimus unleashed a full-scale invasion. The villains and heroes were forced to work together to defeat Ultimus. STRIKE was deployed worldwide to stop the invasion, destroying portals across the globe. As another strike, Ultimus deployed his soldiers to locate various artifacts of mystical power, such as the Ka Stone and the Siege Perilous. As Ultimus hammered down on earth,Scientist Supremesuggested to manufacture the vaccine for STRIKE. As it was administered to members of STRIKE, they retaliated by destroying Ultimus' key Conversion Warship. The warmonger himself fought STRIKE as they fled.\nMultiple times, STRIKE has been sent to handle unrelated issues, such as whenDeadpoolwent on a rampage for the destruction of his favorite Mexican restaurant, and whenThanosattempted to kill Ultimus."

The Celestials were beings of godlike power, having advanced their natural evolution to a point where they were beyond physical forms and thus unable to reproduce. The Celestials found a way around this problem by \"impregnating\" planets with a portion of their essence, which in time would grow to into a new member of their race. The native life of these planets was genetically modified to protect their planet, and unknowingly, the Celestial embryo growing within.\nIn time, the Celestials overpopulated their home universe, causing its eventual collapse. They, along with a number of otherbeingswould survive however and re-emerge as the universe was born anew. A mortal namedGalan of Taaalso survived the end of his universe, and was reborn asGalactus, a devourer of worlds. Galactus was a cosmic equalizer, feeding on worlds impregnated by the Celestials to prevent them from overpopulating and destroying this new universe as they had the previous one.\nAnother ancient race known as theWatcherswitnessed the creation of Galactus, but did not act, as their code forbade involvement. Seeking to free themselves from the confines of their own guilt and their inability to live up to their own laws of non-interference, they eventually petitioned the Celestials for slavery, giving up their right to free choice. The Celestials charged them with watching over worlds impregnated and manipulated by them in order to protect the Celestial embryos within.[2]\nA number of other survivors, known as theElders of the Universeknew not to oppose the Celestials directly. Instead, they sought to recreate their lost universe from the remains of the Celestials' procreation. To that end, they created theRealm of the Dead, which would serve as a collecting pool for both the souls and the matter of the new universe. The Elder known asDeathwould be charged with stewardship over this realm.\nEventually, the Celestials arrived on Earth to impregnate it, as they had done to countless worlds before. Most of the native life of the planet was destroyed as the Celestials carved out a piece of the Earth to create theMoon, whereUatu the Watcherwould oversee the growing Celestial embryo.[3][4]\nCapturing primordial humans, the Celestials manipulated their genetics. Their first creations were theDeviants, but these were programmed with too much aggression and rebelled against the Celestials almost immediately. A second, more stable race was created, known as theEternals. These were instead too perfect, not concerned enough with the fate of the world or aggressive enough to defend it or humanity at large from the threats of the cosmos. The Celestials then implanted the seed within the rest of mankind, believing that humans would escape the notice of both Eternals and Deviants until they could mature into protectors of the Celestial embryo within Earth. With the exception of a few human tribes who avoided Celestial manipulation, all were imbued with an evolutionary seed.[3][4]\nIn time, these seeds would germinate, leading humans to mutate. The first tier of mutation would lead to super-powered individuals, with their powers dependent on the circumstances of their mutation. The second tier would be when all individuals on the planet began to converge, with a shared, common mutation. The third tier would be a complete loss of identity and shape, making the individual susceptible to being shaped by the beliefs of others.[3]\nOne of the first Deviants created by the Celestials wasMephisto. Mephisto reached the third tier of mutation, and with others believing him to be the devil, that would be what he became. Believing that there would come a final, divine judgement and an end of days, Mephisto would use time travel to create alternate realities, ensuring the continuous creation of alternate worlds which he could escape to in order to avoid the final judgement he believed was waiting for him at the end of time.\nAs the Celestials departed, human civilizations would grow and develop at their own pace. The Eternals made their homes in the mountains, becoming the origins of humankind's first myths of divinity, as they were sought out by humans living in the valleys below them. But below these valleys, the Deviants would make their home. 25 000 years ago, they conquered and enslaved humanity, threatening the survival of the human race.\nThis was deemed unacceptable to the Celestials, so the Second Host arrived on Earth and destroyed the Deviant Empire, crushing its capital ofLemuria. The destruction was so total that it crippled Deviant control of humanity, and led to a shift in the tectonic plates, sinking the entire continent ofAtlantis.[3]\nThe Celestials were not the only beings to visit Earth and manipulate its populace. Themselves the victims of Celestial manipulation, theAsgardiansand other creatures who had reached the third tier of mutation arrived on Earth. Believed to be gods by those who discovered them, that is what they became. A crippled storyteller by the name ofDonnersonwas a key figure in shaping the Asgardians. Guided by Mephisto, Donnerson assumed the guise of Odin and became the All-Father of the Asgardian pantheon, weaving stories and tales which the gods reenacted. In exchange for his aid, Mephisto asked for a small piece of Asgard that would be his own. Here Mephisto would plantYggdrasil, which would serve as a map that would allow him to navigate the multiverse.[3][5]\nThe alienKree, a race which had never been manipulated by the Celestials, also arrived on Earth, using theTerrigen Mistto trigger the Celestial seeds implanted within humanity to create theInhumans, hoping to use these super-powered beings as soldiers in their bitter war against theSkrulls. Instead, the Inhumans rebelled against their Kree masters, and hid themselves from the Kree and humanity at large in the hidden city ofAttilan.[3]\nThe Celestials would return one thousand years ago, with the Third Host appearing before the new \"gods\" of Earth. An agreement was struck, whereby the gods agreed not to interfere with the affairs of humanity.[3]\nIt was not until the 20th century, shortly before the arrival of the Fourth Host, when the Celestial seed within mankind began to germinate in great numbers. The first step would be the creation of the originalHuman Torch, an android, while the human-atlantean crossbreedNamor the Submarinerwould be the first example of mutation through natural and environmental means.[3]\nAsWorld War IIraged, the evolution of mankind was sped up as a result of the demands of war. Other superhumans such asCaptain Americabegan to emerge, and this processes would only be sped up further in the decades to come, as more and more mutations began to occur, both through natural means, leading to the emergence ofmutants, and through unnatural means, leading to superhumans such asSpider-Manand theFantastic Four.[6]\nThe alien Kree would revisit Earth, with one of their number, a Kree soldier known as Mar-Vell eventually betraying his people and becoming a defender of Earth. Through the EternalKronos, Mar-Vell gained a portion of the cosmic consciousness, making him aware of the true nature of the cosmos and the universe of the Elders that had preceded his. Despite not fully understanding, Mar-Vell knew he needed to stop the Elders and that in order to do so, he needed to die. He would allow himself to be exposed to a nerve toxin, causing him to develop cancer and soon thereafter passed away.[7]\nAround the time of the creation ofAdam Warlockthe Fourth Host visited Earth, and deemed that things were progressing as planned.[6]\nThis era of history largely mirrors that ofEarth-616up until around the time of the emergence ofOnslaught.\nThe years leading up to the final and complete mutation of humanity proceeded largely as the Age of Marvels had before it.\nAt some point,Captain Americawas asked to become the president of theUnited States of America, but declined.[6]\nWhen theUnited Nationswere made privy toReed Richards' discovery of theNegative Zone, it became a dumping ground for toxic waste, nuclear weaponry and undesirables who could not be held in human prisons. Briefly before the ultimate mutation of humanity, legislation was being passed to exile allmutantsto the Negative Zone. Dismayed by the misuse of his discoveries, Reed destroyed all portals to the Negative Zone and focused instead on solving the energy crisis, hoping that this could unite humanity.\nUnaware of Galactus' role as a cosmic equalizer, Reed Richards turned Galactus into a star in an effort to save a planet from being consumed by him, unknowingly leaving the universe more vulnerable than ever to the Celestials.[8]Despite his new state, Galactus remained sentient. In the far future, the star that was Galactus was discovered byPrince Wayfinder. Within the star, Wayfinder found a sword which he would carry with him on a journey through time and space that would eventually bring him to Earth in the distant past. The sword held the sentience and energy of Galactus, which would become theEnigma Force. The Enigma Force aided in the creation of theMicroverseand bonded itself to Wayfinder. Upon his death, it found a new host in Wayfinder's descendantArcturus Rann.[9]\nArcturus Rann would eventually meet his end, with the Microverse following not long thereafter. With Rann dead, the Enigma Force travelled with him to the Realm of the Dead. Here, Rann bestowed it to Kree heroMar-Vell. With the power of the Enigma Force and the remains of his own latent cosmic consciousness, Mar-Vell began plotting a war to destroy Death herself, to free all those trapped within her realm, and to safeguard the universe from the interference of the Celestials and the Elders of the Universe once and for all.[10]\nAt some point, the never-ending war between theKreeandSkrullsreached a point where both races succeeded in nearly wiping each other out. Their alien empires more or less ceased to exist, and some scattered refugees came to reside on Earth, attempting to blend in with the mutated population. TheSupreme Intelligencesurvived the fall of the Kree and was hidden on Earth's moon by its followers.[11][12]\nIn the Inhuman nation ofAttilan, the Inhuman populace began to grow weary of living under the thumbs of the royal family and Inhuman councils, prompting them to leave the Hidden City in ever-greater numbers.Black Boltknew his people would face persecution and disease in the outside world. Before leaving for exile in space, he activated a bomb created by his brother, unleashing theTerrigent Mistsinto Earth's atmosphere. In order to prevent anyone from learning of his actions, Black Bolt blinded theWatcherbefore releasing the Mists. This led to globalTerrigenesis, causing the entire human population of Earth to mutate.[4]\nThe reasons for humanity's mutation would not be known to anyone besides Black Bolt, leaving many to speculate. Some blamed theSkrulls, the mutants, a divine curse, evolution or the government. Reed Richards would believe that the failure of his vibranium energy project was what caused the mutation of humanity.\nThe result of the mutation was complete anarchy, as scores of super-powered people began fighting each other in the streets for ever diminishing resources.[13]The many heroes of Earth, based out of theBaxter Building, did their best to help as many as possible, but their attempts to reverse the mutations proved futile.[14]\nThe mutation of humanity would lead to the birth of theSkull. When this young child mutated, he gained vast psionic powers. His power was so great that when it manifested, the resulting psychic shockwave killed every telepath on Earth.\nWith humanity rapidly mutating, theSentinelswere activated in a last-ditch effort to contain the surging mutant numbers. With mutants herded into concentration camps, the mutant terroristMagnetostruck against the Sentinels. His attacks were so disruptive that every remaining Sentinel was dispatched to stop him. Magneto led them to theSavage Land, where he could use latent metal in the air itself to destroy them. From the remains of the Sentinels, he constructedSentinel City, a sanctuary for mutantkind, that soon became obsolete, when virtually every remaining human mutated.[15]\nUsing the mutation of humanity and the collapse of society to his advantage,Norman Osborn, formerly the villain known as theGreen Goblinused his power and influence to become president of theUnited States of America. He largely monopolized the American economy, and created theHydraparasite as an enemy to unite the various factions and heroes of America under his banner.[16]\nIn the wake of the mutation of humanity, many nations turned to established super-humans for leadership, believing that those who had experience governing their own powers would be well suited to governing others who also had powers. Democracy came to be considered archaic and obsolete.[17]\nThe mutation of humanity was followed by a disastrous global shortage of food and a failing of industry. What had once required an assembly line and a machine to accomplish now required only one mutated man, and people began staying home and using their powers to take what they needed rather than working, leading to widespread lawlessness.[16]Russiawould emerge as the foremost producer of wheat and breads, becoming a primarily agrarian society, whileEnglandused its navy to distribute Russia's surplus. Other nations, including theU.S.turned to the oceans for sustenance, earning the ire ofAtlantisand its ruler,Namor the Submariner.[17][11]\nAll of what was once Europe would eventually become part of the Kingdom of Britain, ruled by King Britain, the hero also known asBrian Braddock.[18]\nIn the east, former X-ManSunfirewas crowned the new emperor of Japan, and would in time consolidate East Asia and the Pacific Rim in a similar manner.\nAfter being excluded from aU.N.meeting to solve the food crisis, Namor made common cause withDr. Doom, the ruler ofLatveriaand attacked the meeting, murdering the delegates. TheFantastic FourandCaptain Americaintervened, and in the ensuing battle, theHuman Torch,Invisible Womanand Doom all lost their lives, whileFranklin Richardscursed Namor to burn whenever leaving the oceans as punishment for murdering Frankin's uncle.[11]\nThe mutation of mankind also affected their ability to age, with those mutated by the mists seemingly aging at a different rate than those who had mutated previously. It also appears to have sterilized humanity, leaving them unable to reproduce.[19]The mutation of humanity heralded the end of the age of gods. Many gods and those worshipped as gods went into hiding or left Earth, chief among them the Eternals.[20]\nAround the time of the mutation of humanity,Carl Creel, the thug known as the Absorbing Man, used his abilities to transform into a germ. This germ would spread across the globe, killing a third of Earth's population overnight before Creel's lover Titania begged him to stop. After Titania was put into a coma during a battle with theAvengers, Creel merged withUltron.[21]With Creel's near-limitless powers matched with Ultron's intellect, the new combined being laid waste toWashington D.C.and killed theAvengersbefore finally being destroyed byVisionand shattered into pieces which were given to various superhuman defenders around the world for safekeeping , to prevent the Absorbing Man from ever re-constituting himself.[22]\nTo address the hole left in the cosmic balance with Galactus' destruction, theHigh EvolutionaryandWarlockapproached Reed and Franklin Richards for a solution; the High Evolutionary would use his technology to accelerate Franklin's mutation to the third stage, allowing him to replace Galactus. While Reed objected, Franklin volunteered for the good of the universe. Accompanied by theSilver Surfer, Franklin became Galactus, restoring balance to the cosmos.[21]\nNow blind, and unable to observe the Earth, Uatu the Watcher courtedthe Machine Man, known also as Aaron Stack or X-51, to be his new replacement. An artificial man whose highest desire was to truly know what it was to be human, Aaron was convinced by Uatu to accept his summons to the Moon. Here, X-51 would find himself stripped of his human skin, now a translucent machine. Uatu managed to convince X-51 to be his eyes, watching humanity and learning what had happened to the Earth while Uatu was blind.[3]Uatu led X-51 to believe that humanity's ultimate destiny was to becomeCelestials, hoping to gradually dehumanize him until he no longer cared about humanity's true fate.[23]\nThe mutation of all of humanity had triggered the emergence ofBenjamin Beckley. Beckley had the power to place any sentient human within his control, dominating them entirely. This was part of the Celestial plan, as a way of preventing humanity from destroying itself before the infant Celestial could be born, by placing them all under the control of one person acting in their own self-interest.[4]\nBeckley adopted the name “The Skull”, began using a red-dyedPunisherskull as his insignia, and set about conquering America.[11]Using his powers, he began creating an army of superhumans inCalifornia, gradually marching east towards New York City, the seat ofPresident Osborn.[4]\nBeckley's rise to power in the west coincided with the return of theInhuman Royal Familyto Earth.[11]They began searching fortheir sonand the rest of the Inhuman nation, managing to findReed Richardsand convincing him to aid them. In turn, the Inhumans informed Reed of the remains of a destroyed planet, now encased inVibraniumwhich they had discovered on their travels.[19]\nReed's resulting investigation allowed him and the rest of the Royal Family to eventually learn that humanity had mutated due to the Terrigen Mists. Medusa finally figured out that it was Black Bolt who had released them, while Reed was told by X-51, now desperately trying to warn the heroes of Earth of the coming of the Final Host.[4]With humanity having mutated before its time, the Celestials were marching on the planet to scour all life from its surface.[24]\nThe Skull's army finally reached New York, and were faced by an army of heroes from around the world assembled by Captain America. This army quickly came undone as the Skull asserted control over all of them.[8]Captain America narrowly escaped death when he was rescued bySpider-Man. Aware that the Skull could only control creatures with a mind of their own, Captain America launched a last ditch effort to stop the Skull. Using animated clay-versions of heroes in their prime, as well as a distraction by the newX-Men, Captain America was able to get close enough to the Skull to snap his neck, ending his mad campaign to conquer the nation.[24]\nAware that the seed within humanity had germinated far too soon, the Celestials returned to Earth to scour all life from its surface, fearing that humanity would harm the infant Celestial within the planet if left to their own devices.[24]Knowing that Earth's end was coming soon, Reed asked Black Bolt for a favor; Black Bolt, who had figured out the truth about the Celestial plan before releasing the Mists but had been unable to tell anyone, would use his superhumanly powerful voice to cry out for help.[8]When the Celestials arrived in Earth orbit, Black Bolt flew out to face them, and with his dying scream, cried out a name;”Franklin”[24]\nAs the Celestials descended on Earth, its heroes and defenders did their best to drive them off, to no avail. Salvation arrived however, whenGalactuscame to stop them. Galactus was drawn to Earth by hearing his true name, “Franklin”, and managed to drive off the Celestials. After speaking with Reed, still unaware of his true identity, Galactus agreed to spare the Earth, ripping the infant Celestial and the Vibranium it fed on from the Earth's core.[25]\nWith the Earth saved and the cause of humanity's mutation discovered, Reed began building beacons around the world to burn out the Mists from the Earth's atmosphere, hoping to eventually reverse the mutations.[25]\nThe destruction of the Celestial embryo would have unforeseen and catastrophic effects on the world. The Earth's very mass was changed, affecting the planet's polarities. This led to massive climate changes. Within a year of the first human torch being litNew York Cityfroze over, with the cold killing a quarter of the population.[22]\nReed's attempts to reverse the mutations were not welcomed by everyone. Soon, every torch around the globe, including the one in Reed's home within Dr. Doom's castle were under siege by superhumans wishing to keep their powers.[22]These people were egged on byImmortus. Believing that mankind's destiny was to leave the Earth and colonize space, Immortus believed Reed was misguided in attempting to reverse the mutations. Acting through his organization, the Church of Immortus, he and his associateMr. Churchamassed a growing army of superhuman followers.[22]\nWith Osborn dead, the office of president was seemingly abandoned, withJack Muldoonsworn in as Marshall and Lawman of New America.[22]\nFollowing the destruction of the Celestials, former vigilanteKyle Richmondbegan to be plagued by dark visions of the future. At the behest of his friend and former teammateIsaac Christians, Kyle allowed Isaac to record his visions for posterity. Kyle was unaware that Isaac, who due to his mutation had lost the ability to physically feel anything, had made a deal withMephisto, sending him Kyle's visions in exchange for Mephisto helping him with his condition.[22][2]\nWithin the Realm of the Dead, Mar-Vell had launched his plans to destroy Death shortly before the arrival of the Fourth Host. He began appearing in the dreams of certain Earth heroes, warning them of the coming end of Earth at the hands of the Celestials, and also began appearing in the dreams ofAdam Warlockand his wifeEve, telling them he was to be reborn through them.[26]With the help ofAlicia Masters, Mar-Vell was reborn as an unmutated human and placed into the care ofNamor the Submariner, so that he might be protected from the mutated mobs who feared that his birth would herald the end of their powers. Now existing as a binary being, Mar-Vell would wage his war both in the Realm of the Dead and the lands of the living.[27]\nThree years after the destruction of the Celestial embryo, Mar-Vell launched his war in earnest. Within the Realm of the Dead, he and his allies (chief among themArcturus Rann,Phoenixand the astral form ofDr. Strange) began recruiting dead heroes and villains by reminding them of their deaths.[28]\nIn the lands of the living, Mar-Vell began a quest to gather several artifacts of great power as well as to reassemble the full cosmic consciousness, a part of which he had possessed in life. The purpose of collecting these artifacts was threefold; to prevent mankind from destroying itself with them, to use them in the war against Death, and to use them to createParadise, a realm he would build for the dead to inhabit after Death's destruction and which would serve as a bulwark against the Celestials and Elders of the Universe.[28][29]\nAided by Captain America, Mar-Vell gathered several objects of great power before Cap's death during a mission to retrieve the Dimensional Doorway. Following Cap's death, Mar-Vell's retinue expanded to include several heroes, among themBruce Banner,Venom, Namor, andThor.[9]\nWhile Mar-Vell was engaged in his war, unbeknownst to himMephistowas manipulating events for his own purposes. Believing that a final day of judgment awaited him, Mephisto attempted to leave the world in such a wretched state that someone would use time-travel to attempt to undo what had happened, creating a new alternate reality where Mephisto could escape from God's judgment. To this end, his servantRed Roninled theTong of Creelin reassembling theAbsorbing Man, while he posed as Immortus' aide Mr. Church.\nJust as Mar-Vell was preparing for his final battle against Death, the Absorbing Man was reassembled, immediately attacking Manhattan. While Creel wreaked havoc on Manhattan, Mephisto barred Immortus' entry into Limbo, causing him to mutate. Despairing, Immortus planned to use Doom's time machine to travel back and undo his mistakes, just as Mephisto had anticipated. In the last second, Immortus was found by Mar-Vell and his compatriots. Mar-Vell convinced Immortus not to believe Mephisto's lies, and together with Kyle Richmond revealed the truth to Mephisto; that he was merely a deviant, believing himself to be the devil.[30]\nShaken, yet still defiant, Mephisto retreated to the Realm of Death. Here, Mar-Vell's army of the dead had begun to unravel as Death and Mephisto convinced most of Mar-Vell's army that they were still alive, causing them to abandon him. After receiving the final piece of omniscience from Kyle Richmond, Mar-Vell was rendered catatonic in the Realm of the Dead. With his army dissolved, he was captured by Mephisto and Death.[30]\nIn his attempt at stopping the Absorbing Man once and for all, Vision tricked him into absorbing his intangibility, trapping him as a living ghost. This had unforeseen consequences however, as everyone on Manhattan became intangible. This prevented Mar-Vell from completing his plan, since the Silver Surfer was unable to enter the Realm of the Dead, robbing Mar-Vell of the last piece he needed to defeat death. Vision was convinced however to restore Creel's physical form by Loki. Once a villain, Loki had learned the truth about his origins during the battle against the Final Host. Now seeking to free himself from his enforced identity as a villain and trickster, Loki convinced Creel to transform into vibranium and allow the hero known as theIron Maidento redistribute him throughout the Earth's core, in order to save the planet from impending destruction. After appealing to his love for his girlfriend Titania, Creel agreed. With the Surfer once again having physical form, he entered the Realm of the Dead, granting Mar-Vell thePower Cosmic, just as Captain America rallied Mar-Vell's army of the dead. With the final pieces of the puzzle now complete, Mar-Vell convinced Thanos to kill Death, revealing to him that the entity had impersonated his mother, a Skrull who had died during Thanos' own attack on his homeworld.[30]With Death destroyed, Mar-Vell was free to create his Paradise.[30]\nThe destruction of Death and the creation ofParadisewould have many consequences for the world. With Death gone, the denizens of the universe were unable to die, no matter how grievous their injuries.[31]Now unfettered from his fear of the final day of judgement and seeking vengeance for his defeat, Mephisto began randomly attacking and mutilating people, helping to create an ever expanding number of people begging for death.[32]\nWithin Paradise, Mar-Vell had empowered several of his deceased allies as theAvenging Hostand charged them with ferrying the souls of the deceased from theRealm of the Deadinto Paradise. Within Paradise, all of the deceased were given a shard of theCosmic Cube, with which they could create their own personal paradise.[31]Not all of the deceased accepted this new paradise however. Many remained in the Realm of the Dead, unprepared to cross over, and several who had already journeyed to Paradise, led byWilson Fiskchose to return to the Realm of the Dead and carry on a facsimile of their old lives.[31]\nAfter the creation of Paradise, Mar-Vell began to grow more distant from his followers. In addition, the link between his Kree and human selves was severed, leaving the young Mar-Vell on Earth unaware of his counterpart's actions in Paradise.[33]This led to increasing doubts about Mar-Vell's intentions, both among his deceased followers and his still-living allies.[32]With each soul brought to the new heavenly realm, Paradise grew. However, with Paradise located in the heart of theNegative Zone, it soon began to consume ever more worlds within the Negative Zone, angering its denizens.AnnihilusandBlastaarbelieved the blame lay withReed Richardsand went in search of vengeance.[32]\nIn Britain, a marriage between Queen Medusa and King Britain, the foster father of her sonPrince Ahurawas brokered as a way to unite the Inhuman nation.[33]Launching his schemes, Mephisto undermined the wedding by freeingQueen Meggan, Captain Britain's petrified wife, from her stony prison.[34]\nIn an effort to solve the problems caused by Death's destruction,Reed Richardsassembled some of the most brilliant minds of Earth. He reached the conclusion that a replacement to Death needed to be found, to restore the natural balance of the universe.Jude the Entropic Manwas identified as a potential replacement, and freed from his prison before being captured by Richards.[35][36]\nWhile Reed searched for a new Death,ThorandLokicarried out a plan to overthrow Odin and free their people from his story. Now allied withSurtur, they reenactedRagnarokas a way of bringing an end to Odin's control of the Asgardians. With help from X-51, they were able to resist Odin's attempts at warping reality, and managed to convince their people that Odin had lied to them. With Asgard itself fading away, Odin was abandoned in space, unable to die. However, while Thor and Loki left, most of the other Asgardians returned, wishing to carry on living in Odin's stories.[37]\nReed succeeded in synthesizing an artificial compound from Jude which would allow him to administer death to those who desired it. However, Mephisto appeared and freed Jude from his jail, on the condition that Jude would administer his gift of death to all those who already be in Death's realm. Jude agreed, and once freed, began pursuingSusan Richards.[38]The Richards' managed to flee, and having been alerted to the ongoing destruction of the Negative Zone by Annihilus and Blastaar, resolved to find Mar-Vell and learn his intentions first-hand, while Jude, guided by Mephisto, made his way to Britain. With Yggdrasil lost to Mephisto after Thor and Loki's Ragnarok, Mephisto sought theSiege Perilouswhich would give him access to the multiverse once more.[39][40]\nAt the head of an army of Deviants, Mephisto seemingly slew King Britain and triumphed. This was merely a feint however, as King Britain's wife Meggan had assumed his form and sacrificed herself. Mephisto was then killed by King Britain withExcalibur, the only weapon still capable of dealing death, ending his threat once and for all.[7][41]\nFollowing Mephisto's death, King Britain struck a deal with Jude; he would grant Jude an island of his own, and would bring him all those who craved the gift of death. In return, Jude would agree to spare all those who wished to keep living.[41]As theAvenging Hostplotted against Mar-Vell, Captain America recruited theSkullto help him free all those now trapped in their own personal paradises, which had rapidly spun out of control, in some cases becoming waking nightmares.[42]The Avenging Host confronted Mar-Vell, only for him to destroy them. Just as the denizens of Paradise discovered their fate, Paradise was invaded by theKree. Now worshipping Mar-Vell as the new Supreme Intelligence, the Kree sought to resurrect their empire, beginning with the conquest of Paradise.[43]"

She was later released along with other dormant Champions byGuillotineon the Collector's orders as a last ditch effort to stop theMaestroafter learning of his plans. The Summoner was then informed by Romanova that the Maestro had forged anISO-8superweaponthat could threaten theMultiverse.[3]\nWhen the Collector was weakened by theGenesis Stone, a Cosmic Civil War broke out among the Champions of the Contest. Black Widow ideologically sided withIron Man'sIron Faction, who shared the goal of defeating the Collector and using theISO-Sphereto free everyone.Falcon, aligned with the opposingBlue Faction, confronted Natasha in an attempt to get Iron Man's location.[4]\nAfterBlack Pantherscattered the Infinity Stones across the Battlerealm, Black Widow was sent in a battlegroup to retrieve theNightmare Stone. Romanova worried that the stone's abilities would mess with theWinter Soldier's mind, though T'Challa reassured her that his issues were resolved byShuri. The battlegroup retrieved the stone fromProxima Midnight, though they were ultimately tricked into theDeath Stone's mirror dimension. Without anyone to oppose them, theNamelesseffortlessly retrieved theIlluminati's Infinity Stones forThanos.[5]\nWith a completedInfinity Gauntlet, Thanos became the supreme being in the Battlerealm.

They arrived atWakandaafter exploring all of the realities within the Battlerealm, where they encounteredEbony Mawattempting to resurrect their Thanos. Despite his defeat, Maw summoned some Thanos variants into T'Challa's throne room to overwhelm his foes. The Thanos variants were defeated, leaving the Summoner and the Avengers to face Ronin's Thanos, who was also defeated by them.[7]\nBlack Widow andVisionrequested the Summoner to help them find doppelgangers of themselves. They immediately noticedAarkusandCaptain AmericainterrogatingLokifor the whereabouts of a sorceress. As Captain America introduced everyone and explained Aarkus' mission, Loki escaped. As a replacement, Aarkus led everyone toJoe Fixit, who put them on a chase that eventually led them toDiablo, who revealed he attacked them and controlledScarlet Witchto avoid punishment fromClaire Voyant, who shares Romanova's Black Widow alias. They were able to track Voyant down to a dark cave, where the Summoner and Aarkus entered, leaving Natasha and Vision at the entrance in case she attempted to escape.[8]\nWhen theHulkwas killed by an arrow to theHypothalamus, Black Widow was quick to pin the blame onHawkeyeor one of his variants, citing the precision as evidence. When Barton reluctantly confessed, Black Widow had him arrested by the Summoner, after which he revealed that Bruce Banner himself had asked him to do so out of fear of an \"Immortal Hulk\" personality. Iron Man then reported that the Hulk's body had escaped from his lab, prompting them to search for him. Per Romanova's suggestion, they enlisted the aid ofProfessor X, who telepathically entered Hulk's mind and located him at the ruins ofShadow Base. There they encountered the Immortal Hulk, using abandonedHulkbustertechnology to build something. Heeding Banner's warning, the Summoner stopped Immortal Hulk but unknowingly opened theGreen Doorin the process. The Immortal Hulk informed them that he was collaborating with Banner to close the Green Door, but they were now trapped in theBelow-Placealong with a chunk of the Battlerealm.

During the fight, Nat fought hercounterpartand helped Iron Man againsthisone. Eventually, T'Challa changed the past, avoiding Kang sending the first Biomechanoid in the present, the evil Avengers disappeared and the present ones were moved to the new timeline,Earth-92147automatically.[4]"

He raises them for nearly thirteen years before Ultron discovers their existence. When the Vision emerges after a 12-year absence and reveals that he survived - albeit barely - the attack from Ultron, Stark learns that Francis Barton, son of Hawkeye, is also alive. Unfortunately, while the kids are spying on Stark, trying to figure out who the Vision is and what's going on, James accidentally sets off the launch of a series of robots that consist of Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Panther, Thor, Black Widow and Giant Man, designed in the Avengers' image. As a result, Stark's base is revealed to Ultron. Fortunately, Stark stalls Ultron long enough for the kids to escape, but he is ultimately captured. Before this, the Iron Avengers, the robotic versions of the children's parents, are reprogrammed by Ultron to do his bidding.\nHeading to rescue Stark, the four young Avengers meet Barton (whose father survived the initial fight that killed the other five, but was recently killed by Ultron), and team up with him to rescue their guardian. The five then escape Ultron's citadel, (along with an aged Betty Ross), heading for the desert, where former Avenger Bruce Banner, alias the Hulk, is hiding out. After he refuses to help them, James devises a plan to lure Ultron there so as to bring out the Hulk, who can then destroy him. Fighting a losing battle against mechanical doubles of the six fallen Avengers and Thor (whom it is revealed had left to rule Asgard before Ultron surfaced), the young Avengers manage to awaken the Hulk, who fights and ultimately destroys Ultron, ripping him in two. Torunn then flies his body into space to ensure that he can't rebuild himself, and nearly dies in the process. As a result, her father appears to her and explains his reasons for leaving her, and invites her to enter Asgard. Torunn chooses instead to return to her family on Earth, which Thor accepts, telling her that he's proud of her and sends her back in a copy of his armor."

Scavenging a free-floating Shi'ar battleship, crippled by the Builders whom the X-Men hadn't seen in a long time. The last of the X-Men were now scavengers, forced to rely on the supplies of space derelicts to survive. After taking the supplies back to the Blackbird, they prepared to leave the Shi'ar battleship when Beast alerted them all that there was an incoming ship, which it surprised them as it had been a while since they last encountered anyone. It was an Avengers Quinjet and the last of the Avengers boarded the Blackbird. The X-Men weren't sure they are the Avengers and not Skrulls, but Sunspot convinced Cannonball they were the Avengers.\nThe two teams then caught up with each other. Cannonball told Sunspot about what happened on Earth. Of how when they arrived back to Earth, they escaped as quickly as they could. He witnessed the Helicarrier try to evacuate into space, only for the Builders to easily dismantle it, sending its dead into space. In turn Sunspot informed him that they witnessed the death of Thor and he and Smasher were now together. Rachel went to get more Shi'ar wine and discovered the Black Widow and Starbrand stealing their supplies. Using her telepathy she discovered that the Avengers were going to kill the X-Men and were being controlled. Sunspot was unable to tell Cannonball who had been controlling them but did say that they had been stealing the supplies of ships they've come across, and killing their crews."

In this universe both Marvel and Capcom characters live together, though the stories occasionally say that the two sets of characters are in separate universes linked by a rift, with the Capcom universe itself being an amalgamation of different fictional and non-fictional universes therein. This varies between games.\nNames inboldare characters important to the reality (i.e. selectable in at least one game in the series). Bosses are represented inbold italics.\nThe Marvel characters depicted in these games were often based on their incarnations in various early 1990s animated series (particularly X-Men), and were often voiced by the same voice actors. Similarly, theMarvel vs. Capcom 3cast bear similarities to and share voice actors with their late 2000s animated incarnations, such as those seen in Wolverine and the X-Men, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes.\nMany of the characters and fighting mechanics used in these games were first developed and refined in two other fighting games Capcom had developed earlier, serving as precursors to the series:X-Men: Children of the Atom, which featured characters strictly from the X-Men universe, andMarvel Super Heroes, which gleaned characters from Marvel's entire roster (X-Men included).\nAlthough the tag-team fighting concept was not new, it was refined with this series (although fans would argue whether this was for better or for worse). New fighting game terminology, such as \"Aerial Rave\" (the act of performing a combo on an opponent while the opponent remains airborne) and \"Variable Combination\" (the act of having two or more characters on the same team to perform their hyper combos at the same time) were added to the fighting game vernacular with this series.\nThere does not appear to be a concrete story behind each game in the series, although several plot points run across the various games of the series. However, various pairs of characters - typically one Marvel and one Capcom, were often partnered with each other during gameplay (although later games randomized the partnerships so that it was possible to complete the game facing all-Marvel or all-Capcom teams).Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worldsand its update,Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, unlike previous installments, tie into the game's storyline and plot.\nHowever, several interesting (but non-canonical to both Marvel and Capcom continuities) side-plots did emerge throughout the series, some of which contradict the others:"

Driven mad by her powers and the loss of her children, Wanda manipulatedrealityto create Earth-58163, a world where her loved ones were granted their deepest desires.[2]\nIn this reality, rising tensions between humanity and the growing mutant community led to all-out war in the late 20th century. During the early stages of the Mutant-Human War, mutants were driven into hiding by mankind. Scattered and leaderless, the divided mutants were losing the war. Civil wars between humans and mutants began tearing apart not only countries, but entire continents. During this period of insurgency, the ancient mutantApocalypseand the youngMagnetoemerged as leaders of the mutant resistance.[3]\nDisturbed by Apocalypse's brutal and merciless methods, Magneto challenged him for leadership and won. Moments thereafter, Magneto was launched onto the world stage. Using his magnetic powers he destroyed a fleet ofSentinelrobots and declared war against humanity. Having claimed the war's first victory, Magneto's speech was aired live to the entire world.[4][5][3]\nWhile humanity's leaders were horrified and hardened in their resolve to destroy mutantkind, this victory gave hope to the thousands of mutants in the world, who then rallied behind Magneto. Despite this early victory, the war would not be short and remained a guerrilla war for many years. Years after Magneto's declaration of war, the mutant resistance claimed their first major victory in the liberation ofGenosha, by a mutant strike force led by Magneto andCharles Xavier.[4][5]\nNow liberated, Genosha would become the first mutant nation on Earth. Now a head of state, Magneto sought aid for his people. He turned to other outsider-nations, likeAtlantis,Wakanda, andAttilan. While not gaining the aid he had hoped for, Wakanda officially recognized Genosha as a mutant nation, Attilan entered into a defense pact with it and Atlantis agreed to send arms and financial aid.[6]\nHoping to provoke a war that would allow him to destroy Genosha and mutantkind once and for all, U.S. vice presidentBolivar Trasksent a squad of assassins into Genosha with the goal of killing Magneto, using the murder ofGraydon Creedas his reason for striking. When the assassins killed Charles Xavier, Magneto led a strike team against theWhite Houseitself. After learning that Trask had retreated to Manhattan to launch nukes against Genosha, Magneto pursued him. Here, Magneto and his mutants defeated Trask's non-metallic Sentinels, whileKing Black Boltof the Inhumans defended Genosha from the American missiles. After capturingPresident Nixon, the war was effectively over. Magneto presented proof to the public of a grand, multinational anti-mutant conspiracy. With the U.S. defeated, Magneto ushered in a new world order; dominated by mutantkind, and where he reigned supreme.[7][4][5]\nThe world became a Mutant Utopia, in which mutants no longer had to hide and were able to live their lives to the fullest. As they are able to use their abilities without restrictions, they have been able to accomplish things that humans could not have thought possible in their wildest dreams. While the mutants prospered and multiplied, humans became a minority as they dwindled. Humans are tolerated by mutants, but due to their simple genetic structure they are at a definitive disadvantage and among the humans only a few have truly prospered (e.g.Tony Stark).[4][5]\nS.H.I.E.L.D., the worldwide intelligence and peacekeeping organization which had previously waged war against mutantkind, now serves Magneto and his family.Sebastian Shawwas placed in command of S.H.I.E.L.D. and works to assure that mutants remain in control of the world. Its top strike force is theRed Guard, which is led byWolverine. The organization uses a combination of mutant agents, Sentinel robots, and human agents to maintain the new world order.[4]\nEvery day, thousands of mutants emerge throughout the world. The best and brightest of them receive training to become the soldiers and leaders of the future. Two academies were established, one of which trains them to become leaders and diplomats (the New Mutant Leadership Institute in the formerUnited Nations buildingin New York City) and the other one trains them to become S.H.I.E.L.D. Magnus Agents (at a military school within theS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier).[4]"

After theSavage Landspread over much of the planet, thedinosaursroamed freely while humanity could only find relative safety in isolated, fortified settlements.\nStar-Lordarrived on the Savage Shadowland and traversed its landscape using a scanner to track down his friendGroot. Approaching a fortress, Star-Lord drove off a group ofCompsognathusthat attacked him, but had to chase one that took off with his scanner, and was forced to fight more of them. He retrieved the scanner but was getting multiple readings for Groot, making Quill think that it had been broken. When a pack ofVelociraptorsurrounded a group of natives, Star-Lord used a smoke bomb to scare them away, but his scanner started beeping, alerting the creatures. Quill took down the raptors and their alpha. One of the locals,Jekug, thanked Quill and explained they had fallen to the raptors' grasp while trying to rescue their friends who had been captured bySaurians. Quill offered to help out and heads towards the Saurian tribe. He used a hologram projector to cast a holographic image of himself to lure the Saurians away and freed the humans from their cages. Saurians arrived and Star-Lord defeated them and their chief. The chief fled as the Saurians released a rampaging mutatedT-Rex, but was knocked down by it. After Star-Lord took down the dinosaur, he noticed the natives running away in fear, and failed to interpret that a female native was warning him of an incoming mutatedQuetzalcoatlus. The dinosaur lunged at Star-Lord and the native and snatched them. Quill fired at the creature, causing it to drop both of them. Star-Lord catched the native and then defeated the dinosaur. Quill parted ways with the native,Nasati, who warned him about trees that watched in the area. Quill thought she might be referring to Groot and resumed his search. A group ofFlora colossiemerged from the ground and attacked him, but Quill defeated them. He was then confronted by a pack of megaFlora colossibut took them down as well. Moving deeper into the jungle, Star-Lord was confronted and defeated an elderFlora colossi. Afterward, theStar-Lord of New Stark Citydropped behind Quill. Star-Lord initially opened fire and was then disconcerted to be facing a version of himself.New Stark City's Star-Lord invited his counterpart to join him, but Quill was reluctant since he wants to find his team. New Stark City's Star-Lord assured him that his team would find no matter what. Quill joined his counterpart aboard aQuinjet, and the ship flew into a portal to thePrimary Earth.\nDuring the night,Black Widowinfiltrated a Hand Compound and interrogated aHandninja about the location of a group of abducted children to no avail. She was spotted and fought her way through enemies. Delving deeper into the grounds of the Hand Ninja Castle through its roofs, Romanoff took down more ninjas and evaded their traps. Finding two children fighting each other in the castle's training grounds, Natasha was reminded of her past and vowed to never again allow children to be turned into weapons. Natasha spotted a caged dinosaur and set up explosives next to its cage. She then revealed herself to an Elite Hand Ninja and detonated the explosives, freeing the T-Rex. The monster wreaked havoc and took down the Hand's forces. Before it could endanger the child recruits, Black Widow mounted the dinosaur and electrocuted it. The Elite Hand Ninja ordered the children to leave and confronted Black Widow, but he and his subordinates were defeated. Investigating a suspicious wall sculpture, Natasha opened a secret passage leading her to the Hand Ninja Castle, where she defeated more elite ninjas. The Hand's child recruits standing in front of the castle prepared to confront Natasha, when to her surprise, she was approached by The Hand's leader,Daredevil. He told her that the planet has become a savage place that wasn't safe beyond the walls of the castle, and assured that the children could only survive if they become warriors. After Black Widow put Daredevil in the ropes, the children stepped between him and Black Widow. Matt decided to let them decide whether to stay or not, and the children followed him back into the castle despite Natasha's pleas. A portal opens behind Natasha, and theBlack Widow of the New Stark Cityarrives from within. She warned her counterpart of a multiversal threat and the two Black Widows walked into the portal to Primary Earth.\nhttps://www.marvelfuturerevolution.com/en"

        "content": "OriginalZombiverseGalleryOfficial NameEarth-2149[19]AliasesEarth-Z[1]StatusExistingCreators and AppearancesCreatorsMark Millar,Greg LandFirstUltimate Fantastic Four#21(July, 2005)\nEarth-2149 was largely identical to that of the main Marvel reality,Earth-616, with only a few minor differences and some major differences. For example, theSteve Rogersof this Earth was 3 ranks ahead of his 616 counterpart and was known asColonel America. He was also at one pointPresident of the United States, though he never served a full term. Some characters, such asLuke CageandFalcon, retained older versions of their costumes, and as evidenced by the appearances ofVenom,Dark Phoenix,Scarlet Spider, and theWinter Soldier, events such asthe first Secret Wars,the Dark Phoenix Saga,the Clone Saga, andBucky's time as the Winter Soldierstill happened,Black Catalso had a twin sister known asNight Catand theVultureseemed to have been a superhero rather than a villain given his allegiance to the zombified heroes. For major differences, it also appears that this Earth had not yet been visited by Galactus and the Silver Surfer before, and thus theGalactus Trilogydidn't occur either, since the Marvel Zombies show no familiarity with them, and based onThanosappearing as one of the infected in the 40 years later time jump, theInfinity Gauntletnever came to be.[2][3]Given the roles that Galactus and Silver Surfer played in events native to Earth-616, it might mean that Earth-2149's interaction with cosmic and alien beings was very limited until the outbreak.[4]Generally, Earth 2149's main point of divergence is unknown.\nThis reality continued on in this way, until it was ravaged when a version of theSentryofyet another alternate universe(who was sent byhis native Watcherto create a temporal loop and prevent the infection from spreading to alternate realities),[5]brought with him a disease that turned individuals into flesh-eating zombies. The Avengers were the first on the scene after Sentry crashed in the middle ofManhattan, and all were quickly infected. The disease soon spread throughout the superhuman community, with the super powered undead feasting on the non-powered population. With most of the human life of this Earth extinguished, the super-zombies wandered the world, tormented by hunger with nothing to eat.[4]\nMagneto's last stand\nSoon afterMagneto, one of the last uninfected villains/heroes, was eaten, theSilver Surferarrived to announce the coming ofGalactus. Many zombies tried to eat him, but onlyHulk,Wolverine,Spider-Man,Iron Man,Giant-Man,Power-Man, and Colonel America succeeded. TheZombie Galactiabsorbed his powers, so they used it to toast the other zombies and eat them, hoping they would taste better fried, but after eating them, the remaining zombies commented how they tasted bad anyway and were left starving once again.[6]\nAfter eating Galactus\nHowever, Galactus immediately arrived, and the initially zombies tried to eat him too and launched an unsuccessful and ineffective attack, but an enraged Galactus attacked them for eating his herald. After retreating, they usedVibraniumto create a machine that united theirPower Cosmicto take him down, but their zombie villains used the opportunity to try to eat Galactus as well; the Zombie Galacti faced their old enemies one last time and killed them. Before Galactus could recover, they quickly devoured him, absorbed his Power Cosmic, and used it to travel through space to consume other life forms.[7]During this time, some remaining zombies on Earth tried to reachthe mainstream reality, but their plans failed, with some of them being killed by their original counterparts.[8]\nIntergalactic Zombie Group\nAfter forty years consuming planets, at the edge of the known universe, the Zombie Galacti realized that practically all the life in the universe was gone, so they decided to return toEarthto repair an old Dimensional Travel Machine of Reed's to consume other dimensions. By this point, Phoenix, Firelord, and Gladiator had joined the Zombie Galacti; Thanos joined them as well, but was killed by the Hulk after he accused the green monster of being as responsible as the other zombies for the extinction of life in the universe and for eating more than the rest of them. After arriving back to Earth, they encountered a group of survivors led by a zombifiedBlack Panther, who survived with the severed heads ofWaspandHawkeyein robot bodies along with theAcolytes.\nThe Hulk tried to eat them, but was stopped by Giant-Man who suggested creating some sort of breeding project to produce more \"food\", but Spider-Man was against the idea and attacked Hank, who demanded that someone kill Spider-Man. Wolverine tried to do it, but Power-Man stopped him, then Wasp, Hawkeye, and T'Challa helped them fight the \"bad\" zombies while the group of humans hid.\nA forcefield was activated and separated the good zombies and humans from the bad ones; this made the Hulk lose consciousness and revert into Bruce Banner, cut Power-Man in half, and trappedGladiatorinside, resulting in his death. Having no remaining way to prey on the survivors, the \"bad\" zombies decided to return their attention to the Dimensional Travel Machine at theBaxter Building.\nThere they discovered that the Dimensional Travel Machine was actually in the survivor's camp, so they returned to New Wakanda, where Wasp, Spider-Man, Hawkeye, Power-Man, and Black Panther offered to give up the machine if the \"bad\" zombies left them, and the humans, alone. Deception and another battle ensued. Banner gained consciousness and tried to eatReynoldsin a security room from which he was watching the battle, which also contained the lever that activated/deactivated the force field. In his panic, he accidentally disabled the force field, so the \"bad\" zombies concluded that they could not only steal the machine but also eat the humans as well, but their hunger for flesh left before they could do it. Banner turned into Hulk and started eating again. All the various zombies tried to stop him, but Iron Man,Phoenix,Firelord, and Hawkeye were killed.\nReynolds offered to let the Hulk eat him if he would spare the others, having lost his lover the Wasp in the previous battle with Ant-Man. After eating Reynolds, Hulk changed back into Banner and let himself be killed by the remaining zombies before he could become the Hulk again. Weeks later,Malcolm Cortezdecided he liked his lifestyle and didn't want the zombies around, so he tricked them, sending all of the remaining zombies toEarth-91126.[9]\nZombie Reed tricking the Ultimate Universe's Reed"

As a young adult, Amanda became a small-time musician under the stage name of Amanda Strong. One night after a performance, she was recruited intoS.H.I.E.L.D.byValentina Allegra de Fontaine, hoping to use her career as a cover for missions around the world.[2]\nWith the help of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s contacts, Amanda became a moderately successful vocalist for her own band. One night before travelling toGermanyto deliver a package, she met the package's courier, a fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. agent namedJude. When she arrived to the Indra Club inHamburg, Amanda's cover was blown, and she was attacked by an assassin. Jude saved her life, later admitting that he had followed her to Germany hoping to see her performance and ask her on a date afterwards.[2]The two agents were soon intercepted by undercoverHydrasoldiers, but managed to escape from the hotel where Jude had taken Amanda regardless of the enemy presence.[3]\nYoung Amanda\nThe incident at the Indra Club was covered up as an attack from an overzealous fan, allowing Amanda to remain operating undercover. She continued her career, and started dating Jude. After a two-year relationship, Amanda became pregnant and quit S.H.I.E.L.D.. A week before the baby was due, Jude tried to convince Amanda to disappear. He eventually revealed to have been working as a Hydra double-agent, showing his true nature as a selfish man who had no problem working for both sides and selling out fellow agents as long as it made profit. As Jude was trying to convince Amanda to accept Hydra's protection, she stabbed him in the neck with a pair of scissors.\nShocked by this development, Amanda decided she was going to give up the baby for adoption to a happy and safe family, requesting wherever he was sent to, the baby retained his birth name: Anthony. S.H.I.E.L.D. partially granted Amanda her wish,[3]and instead left the baby in an orphanage inSofia,Bulgaria, the place where it was born.[4]After learning of Amanda's pregnancy, S.H.I.E.L.D. founderHoward Starkkept an eye on the baby and adopted him, taking the birth records in the process.[3]\nReunited with her son\nDecades later, Amanda had become aLondon-based music producer. WhenTony Starkinvestigated his true parentage, he found that Amanda could've been his true mother, and visited her at her record label.[4]Tony demonstrated his desire to get to know his mother, and the two hugged as Amanda called him, \"My boy.\"[3]Before Amanda could bond with her son, Tony fell into a coma as a consequence of thesecond superhuman civil war. Tony's company,Stark Industries, fell to the hands of Amanda as established by his will. Amanda accepted the position to prevent the board of directors from taking control of the company, while Tony's A.I. assistantFridayran the company behind the curtains.[5]\nWhen Tony recovered from his injuries, he went into hiding for a brief time. After he meet up with Amanda to ensure her he was safe, she was approached by Jude.[6]He revealed her he had been resurrected by Hydra, and continued operating from behind the scenes for decades, only deciding to step into the light after learning what had become of their son. Jude coerced her into luring Tony to a trap. However, Tony's assistantMary Jane Watsonappeared and shot Jude in the shoulder, which prompted him to decloak a battalion of Hydra soldiers. A massive fight sparked afterIronheartand many other heroes arrived to confront Hydra. In the middle of the brawl, Jude got hold of MJ's gun and tried to shoot Amanda in the back. Before he could to so, he was knocked out by Iron Man.[7]\nAmanda joined the upper management of her son's subsequent enterprise, the think tank calledStark Unlimited.[8]She hit it off with roboticistAndy Bhang, a music aficionado and a fan of hers,[9]and eventually got into a relationship with him. On the other hand, Amanda found it hard to connect with her son, and struggled to find common ground with him since Tony was constantly occupied; something Amanda worried Tony was doing on purpose to avoid her.\nAmanda being confronted by Motherboard inside the eScape\nWhen Tony launched his next major project, a virtual landscape called theeScape, Amanda followed him into the digital world,[10]but she was abducted by the eScape's operating system,Motherboard,[11]who had been unwittingly damaged and left corrupted by a hacker attack from the villainousController.[12]Motherboard was a program made from the engrams of Tony's late adoptive motherMaria Stark,[13]and she contended that she was Tony's true mother.[14]To this end, Motherboard used her ability to warp eScape to her whim to enthrall Tony. When Amanda managed to snap Tony out of Motherboard's influence, she disclosed that since Tony had effectively rebuilt his body from scratch when he woke up from his coma, he was genetically a completely different being.[12]This revelation shook Tony and Amanda to their core. When they escaped from the eScape, Amanda decided to leave Tony's life since she felt she had no attachment to him. She tried to convince Andy to leave with her, but he refused in favor to continue working with Stark.[15]"

When Shang-Chi succeeded on murdering Petrie, he would escape into the night beforeSir Nayland Smithwould awaken and find his friend dead. Because of this difference in events, Shang-Chi would never learn from Smith of his father's evil and remain loyal to Fu Manchu. Returning to his fathers headquarters, Shang-Chi would be further convinced by his father that Smith was evil and must be destroyed as part of his goals to convert Earth culture to that of ancient China.\nHe would send Shang-Chi on a mission to Highgate Cemetery in London to collect the bodies of fiveDacoitsthat were killed by Smith twenty years earlier. Smith meanwhile would be gathering his alliesBlackjack Tarr,Clive Reston, andLeiko Wutogether to try and put an end to Fu Manchu. Intelligence from M.I. 6 would lead them to Highgate Cemetery where they would clash with Shang-Chi and Fu Manchu'sSi-Fanwarriors.

When Shang-Chi would learn of his fathers goals to resurrect these men as his soldiers as a means of taking over London, he would begin to have wavering doubts about his fathers \"noble\" goals. Meanwhile, Blackjack Tarr and the others would question a captured member of the Si-Fan to learn the location of Fu Manchu's headquarters.\nWhen Fu Manchu would unleash his Dacoits of Death on Buckingham Palace in the hopes of eliminating the royal family, Smith and his friends would be there with the police to try and fight them back. Shang-Chi, not wishing to let innocent people be murdered by his father would break out of his home and go to Buckingham Palace to stop the Dacoits of Death from completing their mission. Shang-Chi would help M.I. 6 fight off the invaders, however he would be horrified by Clive Reston's use of a flame thrower to incinerate the Dacoits. Confronting his father, Shang-Chi would renounce him and his mission to take over the world and Fu Manchu would escape. When the remaining Si-Fan minions would be rounded up by the police, Nayland Smith would offer Shang-Chi to join them. However, having come to consider M.I. 6 to be no different than his father, willing to kill to suit their own ends, Shang-Chi would refuse and try to stop his father on his own.[1]"

TheFantastic Fourcaptured him and brought together a science team consisting ofReed Richards,Hank Pym,T'Challa, andHank McCoyto figure out what has happened to him. They learned that Spider-Man's DNA had been completely rewritten, leaving him as he was but primitive and predatorial human being.\nDespite what was happening to Spider-Man life continued normally forWolverineuntilPsylockewas kidnapped and later found completely devoured. As he took up the search for her killer, the world fell apart around him. The second major incident occurred at a Chinese restaurant wherethe Blobate twenty-five people inside.\nThings started to get worse when the science team realized that the virus had been around for a while, making it almost impossible to keep up with it. Reports started popping up in all five boroughs of New York and some in New Jersey. Reed started to view it as a global threat.\nLogan was sent to pick up equipment that was shipped to the science team fromUtopia, which was supposed to have arrived the day before. He found the shipment in Central Park and killedAngelwhen he saw that he was infected. Realizing that the infection has spread to Utopia, Wolverine traveled there and killed the infectedX-Men.[1]\nWhen Logan returned, the scientists had figured out that the outbreak was caused by Survivor 118. Based on police reports, they deduced that the Punisher had ambushed a shipment of Survivor 118 and sent Logan to bring him to them. After finding him, he brought him to theBaxter Buildingfor the scientists to give him blood and tissue tests. However, along the way, Magneto and Electro got into a fight, causing an EMP explosion that knocked out the city’s power. Inside, they found that Hank McCoy had succumbed to the plague and the infectedBen Grimmhad released Spider-Man. To make matters worse, Spider-Man and Beast were eating Hank Pym. Punisher killed Hank McCoy, but Spider-Man was able to flee. Thing and his alliesRed She-HulkandThundrafought against the Punisher, Wolverine, Reed and T’Challa until he chose to escape with Thundra while using Red She-Hulk as a distraction.\nIn the aftermath, T’Challa told them aboutWakanda's demise. His sisterShuriescaped toNew Jerseywith a handful of refugees on aQuinjet, but their exact location was unknown. New Jersey was also the location of a warehouse where Reed stored old machines that could be used for starting a new lab. With this knowledge, Reed and T’Challa decided to move operations to New Jersey.\nThing went tothe Hulkin hopes of merging tribes with him so that they may kill the scientists. An escort of heroes led a convoy of scientists out of New York, but the Hulk’s tribe confronted them on the Goethals Bridge. The heroes held them back for as long as possible while the scientists were led to safety. The battle claimed many lives on both sides and cost Wolverine his left arm and one of his claws.[2]\nThe science team was able to successfully reach Elizabeth, New Jersey and was hiding in a storage facility. Afterwards,Captain America,Deadpool, and the Punisher recovered Wolverine from the river and brought them to a hidden base. From there, Deadpool was sent to gather intelligence on the Hulk's mission to find the scientists. However, Deadpool was infected himself and was hiding it from the group. Black Panther met up with the group to give them information about their situation. Their rescue ships had not arrived for them, they had lost all contact with Shuri, and the trucksLuke Cagewent to find would take three to four hours reach the scientists.\nThey then formulated a plan to hold off the Hulk, who was moving in closer and closer to the science team and were approaching Newark Bay. Ten minutes later, the small group gathered to fight the Hulk's army, but the Hulk was nowhere to be found. So while Captain America and the Punisher fought the army, Wolverine and Deadpool went after the Hulk. Locked in battle, Captain America was beginning to turn, so the Punisher put him out of his misery. Wolverine and Deadpool eventually found the Hulk and confronted him, during which Wolverine was sent flying into the distance. Luckily, they were able to hold the Hulk back long enough for the science team to escape. Along the way they found Wolverine and brought him with them.[3]\nThorrallied what was left ofthe Avengersat Ground Zero of the plague. There,Doctor Doommade his move and offered them a cure in the form of his Doomstones, made from his own brand of science and alchemy.[4]In exchange, he wanted to be named Emperor of Earth. Outraged by his proposal, the Avengers fought him, only to be interrupted by an army ofSubterraneansled byHercules. Doom helped kill the army, eventually convincing the Avengers to accept his offer.[5]\nOperating from the Baxter Building, Doom rerouted the backup power to power an electrified fence around all five boroughs while hisDoombotsmanufactured the parts. The Doomstones were designed to keep the plague from coming to the surface and wipe the mind of the infected. With the city now secure, safety camps were established to house the uninfected, including theJavits Convention Center, which housed 20,000 people and one third of the medical team. The Avengers questioned themselves for taking part in this plan, but Thor took it the hardest, choosing to abandon the planet he had called home rather than assist Doom.\nDoom demonstrated his cure toHawkeyewhen he showed him the previously infectedDakenwith a Doomstone embedded into his chest. The Doomstone allowed him to reclaim his humanity, but his mental state was reduced to that of a child.\nAs the Avengers continued to wrestle with trusting Doom, Hawkeye stumbled on Deadpool dragging a dead body into the Baxter Building. When he followed him inside he found out that Doom was infected.[6]Doom revealed to him that he created the Doomstones to turn its wearer into a cannibal while still allowing them to retain their intelligence and memories. Doom activated them, turning almost everyone in New York, including the Avengers, into cannibals.\nHawkeye, the Punisher, andBlack Widowwere the only heroes left. Tasked with finding any remaining heroes, they fought against many cannibal tribes, during which Spider-Man kidnapped Black Widow. The Punisher broke off from Hawkeye to hunt and kill Spider-Man, leaving Hawkeye to confront Doctor Doom. Using an arrow made from Wolverine's broken adamantium claw, Hawkeye succeeded in killing Doom and swore to avenge his fallen comrades. However, seconds later, Thor returned briefly to kill Hawkeye for unknown reasons, making the Punisher the last person in New York City to fight the infected.[7]\nThe infected started forming tribes that fought each other for land, manipulated in secret bythe King of Death, one of the more intelligent and cunning cannibals. Spider-Man, now referred to as Patient Zero, was the most successful, drawing in scores of infected to his tribe. He claimedManhattanfor himself while other tribes left to stake new lands.\nOver the next few years, the King of Death and his tribe destroyed the other tribes and forced them to join him. Using his resources, the King of Death was able to move into Manhattan fromBrooklyndespite the destruction of every bridge and tunnel and made a push to take Manhattan from Patient Zero.[8]\nTwo years later, the scientists had moved operations to theNorth Poleand were preparing for human testing. Wolverine was still with them and assisted in bringing uninfected to their lab for safety.[3]\nMeanwhile, the Punisher continued his war against the cannibals, even taking the heads of those he killed and placing them on pikes outside his base of operations. Among his most notable was his victory over Thing, who he killed by destroying him in the Baxter Building. On day 1,813, he killed Deadpool for the thirty-third time.[9]Then on day 1,830, he finally killed the Hulk with the same arrow that Hawkeye used to kill Doctor Doom.\nWith the King of Death moving to take his territory, having also taken his mateMary Jane Watson, Patient Zero sentVenomto request help from the Punisher. Frank ran into him at a church, where he had just found a priest (who he called \"Padre\") and a young boy. But before he could explain his reason for being there, Frank killed him. He tried a more direct approach by appearing at Frank's base of operations with Deadpool[10]and told him about his troubles. He then offered to give him the survivors that have been hiding if he killed the King of Death and brought back his mate.\nAt first against his offer, the priest convinced him to agree to it. Patient Zero's tribesmen Deadpool, Black Widow, andScorpionjoined him on his mission. After arriving at the King's lair near Ground Zero of the infection, they were attacked by his tribe.[8]The Punisher was tortured for information on Patient Zero's location while Deadpool was imprisoned, but Frank didn't tell him anything, knowing that the hidden survivors would be found and killed as well. Deadpool broke out and served as a distraction while Mary Jane freed the Punisher. Then, he took the opportunity to kill the cannibals, along with Deadpool. With the King of Death's tribe decimated, the Punisher killed him.\nWhen the plague first hit, the Avengers helped hold back the infected in New York. Slowly, they lost several important members of their team, including Captain America and Thor. Hawkeye was the last Avenger standing until Thor returned to kill him.\nThe Avengers included many other spin-off teams such asAvengers AcademyandNew Avengers.\nBased inCalifornia, the X-Men were thought to be safe from the plague. Unfortunately, that was not the case and, in fact, everyone on Utopia was infected. Wolverine traveled there to kill them and put them out of their misery.\nA team of over 80 of the world's top scientists brought together by Reed Richards and anchored by T'Challa, Hank Pym and Hank McCoy. They originally operated out of the Baxter Building until they were attacked, causing significant losses in their staff with the deaths of Hank Pym and Hank McCoy. They moved operations to Alaska and then the North Pole later on to find the cure.\nRuled by Shuri, Wakanda would eventually fall to the plague. Shuri was able to escape with a few survivors to New Jersey on a Quinjet and kept in touch with her brother T'Challa. Unfortunately, they lost all contact at some point and the subsequent fate of Wakanda's uninfected remains unknown."

The warp changed the time period to a medieval setting altering the Avengers clothing, speech patterns, and thought processes. All of the Avengers involved believed themselves to be a part of the Queen’s elite guard known as theQueen's Vengeance.[1]\nIn 1998, the civilized world was ruled from Tintagel Head, off the coast of Cornwall, from which Queen Morgan the First oversaw the lands and dominion, issuing decrees and meting out justice. The queen was loved by the citizenry and those who didn't died in the dungeons.\nThe Queen's Vengeance, the Queen's elite guard, were deployed against the Picts in the north but were unable to stand against them. When they struck, they do so without hesitation and show no mercy. The Queen's subjects have pride in the Queen's Vengeance and yet feared them also. Morgan allowed the Pictish rebellion to occur for her entertainment. She also permitted the existence of other powers on Earth for her amusement, including MandarinChinaand the Empire ofDeviant Lemuria. In this reality, all mystic power was reserved for Morgan.\nTheScarlet Witchwho was imprisoned in the dungeons and fully aware of what had happened, reached out to anyone who could hear her thoughts. This resulted inThor (Donar)having doubts which he presented to his queen, and then left to go toAsgardto find the answers.Captain America (Yeoman America)was the first to realize the truth and convinced five other heroes to remember their past. Most of them didn't though and battled the six until Thor arrived. He remembered and helped them escape. Meanwhile, Wonder Man was restored to life in the dungeons and freed the Scarlet Witch."

Decades later, theX-Menhad played a major role in the world as a force for justice and peace. Strucker had been convicted as a war criminal and sentenced to death. A peace treaty had been signed by Palestine and Israel. Kenya elected Ororo Munroe to be their president. Magneto and Gabrielle Haller were married and Xavier was an adviser to the President of the United States, and had weekly meetings with the heads of the Federal Security Bureau, the National Security Council, the National Security Affairs, and the Weird Happenings Organization.\nBolivar Trask considered mutants a threat to the human race, and with his son controlling one of the world's most powerful corporations, posed a dangerous threat to mutant kind. Valerie Cooper advised Xavier that the President needed him to broker negotiations with Genosha, as he was the only one they trusted. At the Xavier Institute, all the mutants that had been found so far by Xavier were at the institute but they suspected there were far more out there but lacked the means to find them until their powers manifested in public or were brought to the institute.Dr. Hank McCoybroughtJean Greyto the institute, hoping they could help her. Unnoticed by all, a man left a small device at institute. Colonel Vazhin of Russia introduced Xavier toPeter Rasputin, trained by the Black Widow herself.WolverineandMystiqueworking security, pulled over a freight truck leading a convoy. The scanner inside revealed that the policewoman (Mystique) who pulled them over was a mutant and the driver shot her in the face with a shotgun. Logan and Mystique then attacked the truck, and realizing that they've been discovered the convoy of trucks launched their cargo toward the institute.\nBack at the institute, Xaviar was discussing with McCoy the case of Jean Grey who had been in a coma since childhood due to psychological trauma, but had recently begun to exhibit paranormal abilities. LaterKitty Pridetook McCoy and Peter on a tour of the Institute which included its underground bunker complex and all the tech they had. Erik (Magneto) used his powers on Jean Grey, and was able to determine that her abilities were similar to that of Xavier. While discussing her condition, the institute came under attack by Sentinels. Which being made of plastics and ceramics were immune to Magneto's powers. Kitty and Peter headed to the surface and engaged the Sentinels, quickly taking one out.Sageand McCoy reached the surface afterwards and opened up on the Sentinels with sniper rail-gun rifles firing depleted uranium rounds, and took out another one. Logan and Mystique arrived at that moment in one of the trucks, and Logan took out another Sentinel. At the moment that the Sentinels had adapted to their powers and were on the verge of killing the X-Men, every Sentinel was completely destroyed and turned into molecules by an awakened Jean Grey."

Vision then informed him of what had been happening in the past two months. Regarding the Skrull invasion, the sleeper agents hidden among the population, and the devastating results. In which 88% of the planet's human population had already been exterminated, including the Young Avengers. TheX-Menwere the first to be targeted, and mutants were now nearly extinct. Tony Stark's New Hero Initiative had been compromised by the Skrulls from the beginning and most of them had been destroyed. Only a few superhumans remained and though they continued to fight on, their efforts so far had not borne results.\nHulk left with Vision and joined the resistance known as the Avengers which so far had been waging a guerrilla war. In the process giving the civilians hiding out with them hope. Weeks later news reached the Skrull capital city on Earth, New Satriani (formerlyLas Vegas), that the human resistance was growing, numbering in the 1000s with new superhumans joining their cause, including the Hulk. The Bishop gave the order to unleash their secret weapon to end the human resistance once and for all. While Hulk was giving a motivational speech to his new Warbound, the Wasp revealed herself a Skrull to Hank Pym and gave him an injection which turned him into a genetic time bomb. Which killed all present except the Hulk."

Among them are many familiar faces such asThe Spider(Spider-Man),The Bard(Daredevil) andSir Nicholas Fury, living alongside historical figures of the time like monarchs Elizabeth I of England and James VI of Scotland, William Shakespeare, and the first English child born in America,Virginia Dare.\nThe origins of the 1602 universe (Earth-311) actually began in an alternate future reality designatedEarth-460. The Earth-460 version ofPurple Manhad become President-For-Life, and many of Earth's other heroes had either died from old age or been hunted down and killed. OnlyCaptain Americaremained to fight for democracy, but he too was betrayed and captured. Not wanting to leave any remains that could serve as a rallying point for rebellion, the Purple Man instead had him sent into the past ofEarth-616.\nCaptain America found himself in America shortly before the Europeans founded theRoanokecolony.[1]For reasons unknown, the Captain's arrival caused the early creation of other heroes and villains and the subsequent destabilization of reality. Eventually, the destabilization was fixed by Captain America's return to his own timeline, and the alternate history he unwittingly created was separated from Earth-616 and preserved as a new dimension, called Earth-311.\nAnother notable and unexplained difference in this timeline was the continued existence of dinosaurs, variously referred to as \"leather wings\" and \"thunder lizards\" depending on species. Though they lived throughout Earth-311, such as in Latveria - where they are the size of small birds - and as pets in Carlos Javier's school, they were found most most prominently in the so-called New World, which was home to many even larger specimens.\nAt some point, the A.I.M. of Earth-616 also established an interdimensional outpost on this Earth.[2]\nFollowing the split, Earth-311 was kept within a jewel byUatu the Watcher.\nCover ofMarvel 1602#1\nThe world of Earth-311 is much as it was in the year 1602 onEarth-616. Political powers includeEngland,Scotland, the Catholic Church centered onRome, andLatveria. Latveria was ruled byCount Otto von Doom, who was called \"the Handsome\" and intended to rule the world. England was ruled at first byElizabeth I, and later by James VI of Scotland following Elizabeth's assassination by Doom's minions (a year earlier than her death in the real world). The Roanoke Colony in America also declared its independence from Britain after many super-powered individuals fled persecution under James I.\nMutantsexist, but they are most commonly referred to as the \"witchbreed\" (also called \"mutantur\", Latin for \"changing ones\"). The Catholic Church, as well as devout Protestants such as James VI, considered the witchbreed to be devil-worshipers and hunted them down. The InquisitorEnrique, himself a witchbreed, allowed witchbreed to survive if they could pass as human so that they could eventually join his \"Brotherhood of Those Who Will Inherit The Earth\". Elizabeth I also allowed witchbreed to live in England, where they were taught atCarlos Javier's Select School for Sons of Gentlefolk. James VI's first act after Elizabeth's death was to round up and imprison all of Javier's students, forcing them to escape to America.\nEarth-311 was once beset by bizarre weather, including lightning storms without rain and blood red skies. Earthquakes, floods, rains of lizards, and other natural disasters were also reported. These phenomena were caused by the destabilization of reality (in turn caused by Captain America's presence in the time line), and ended once Earth-311 was separated from Earth-616.\nThe remnants of this reality, which perished due to theincursions, were salvaged byGod Emperor Doom, and were made part of hisBattleworldas the domain known asKing James' England.[3]\nWith Earth-311 seemingly fully restored as part of theEighth Cosmosonce the incursion crisis had subsided, it eventually came under the threat of a new multiversal crisis in the form of a mysterious plague dubbed theRed Death. While scientists such asBaron Victor Octaviussought to find a cure,Prince Ionelloinstead chose to isolate himself in his own castle with his \"dearest compatriots\" and his jesterHieronymus Skeltonso that they might party safely until the disease had run its course. The red pestilence eventually arrived at their door, however, and killed everyone inside the castle.[4]"

Toshiko arrived and it was discovered the Dr. Jasper Scott had infected Iron Man, Cap and Hawkeye with a new strain of the virus that was not responding to the current anti-virus and she revealed he was her brother and the actual source of the virus. Whilst they had been working on an early stage of it, they discovered it could regenerate missing fingers and Jasper was patient zero. Jasper, meanwhile was unleashing his new zombies onto New York.[5]\nThe Avengers went out to Jasper and were overwhelmed by the zombies long enough for Jasper to kidnap Bruce and attempted to use him to convince Tony to return to weapon's manufacturing. Bruce refused and was eventually rescued just before it was revealed that Jasper was mutating into a Human-Chitauri hybrid.[6]"

As the Maestro's demands became too excessive, the Collector used hisISO-Sphereto disguiseSkrullsas the desired Champions.[18]When Champions fell in battle, the Collector experimented resurrecting them with mixed results.[19]The Champions who failed to meet certain standards were discarded in storage.[20]\nAt some point, the Maestro forged the shards of multiple dimensions onto the planet he brandedBattleworld.[16][21]\nThe Maestro's endgame\nThe Collector brought theSummonerandKang the Conquerorto the Battlerealm to compete in the Contest of Champions for his ISO-Sphere. The Summoner prevailed against Kang by collaborating with their Champions instead of commanding them with the ISO-Spell.[22]When the Collector summonedThanosfrom his crystal, the Titan proved insusceptible to control and allied with the Summoner to defeat Kang.[23]The Summoner continued to be tested against minor opponents until the Maestro pitted Thanos against them. Despite the motivation to defeat the Summoner and challenge the Maestro's reign, Thanos was overpowered by the Summoner and banished to his crystal. In the meantime,Captain America,Iron ManandDoctor Strangefreed Champions from the ISO-Spell.[24]\nLeaving the Collector to manage the Contest on his own, the Maestro orderedYellowjacketto haveAdaptoidsharvest ISO-8 from theMicrorealmsinto an Infinity Stone.[25]UponAnt-Man's warning of a sinister plot, the Collector and the Summoner formed a rebellion opposing the Maestro. Knowing of their betrayal, the Maestro retaliated, threatening to use the newbornGenesis Stoneagainst them. Released as a reinforcement, Thanos interrupted the Summoner and Maestro's battle by overpowering Maestro and escaping with the Genesis Stone.[16][26]\nThe Maestro was left to die on Battleworld,[21]leaving the Collector, weakened from Maestro's retaliation, in full control of the Contest. This triggered the Cosmic Civil War between Iron Man'sIron FactionandCaptain America (WWII)'sBlue Faction, each of which had conflicting plans for dealing with the Collector and escaping the Battlerealm.[27]As the war intensified, each faction's lieutenant defected with the Summoner to find the reclusiveCivil Warrior, who helped put an end to the fighting.[28]\nPreviously promoted as the Collector's science advisor,[20]M.O.D.O.K.dispersed ISO-infusedTerrigen Mistacross the Battlerealm that enhancedmutantmutations at the expense of their sanity. A mutant rebellion formed in response, quietly backed by the Summoner. In a failed attempt to hijack theGhost Orchid,Magnetoraided the Collector's Champion Vault, freeingJean Greyand scattering countless Champion crystals across the Battlerealm.[29][30]Awakened by the ISO-Terrigen, thePhoenix Forcewithin Jean Grey transformed her into Dark Phoenix and purified the atmosphere. After the Summoner's Champions prevented her from causing more destruction, Jean's body underwent a unique ISO-basedTerrigenesisthat birthed theEvolution Stonein time for Thanos to seize it.[31]\nThe Collector bound!\nConcerned by Thanos' advances, Doctor Strange assembled theSorcerer's Conclaveto magically speak withGuillotine, who was kidnapped by the Mad Titan. Although their communication was sabotaged byKarl Mordounder Thanos' influence, Guillotine was able to divulge how Infinity Stones are made.[32]Using this revelation, Doctor Strange manipulatedDormammuinto trapping himself in the Battlerealm to create theWar Stonefrom his defeat.[33]\nMeanwhile, the Collector was preoccupied with the Grandmaster's return and challenge to his dominion over the Contest— the Elder's War.[14][32]The Grandmaster swiftly outmaneuvered the Collector by siphoning power from the ISO-Sphere and seducing the Battlerealm's residents with promises of liberty. When the Summoner was swayed against him, the Collector was vanquished by their Champions and imprisoned into his own crystal by the Grandmaster.[34]\nNow armed with the full power of the ISO-Sphere, the Grandmaster immediately betrayed his promises by rewriting the Contest's rules to prolong it. In an attempt to organize the Contest, the Grandmaster split every Champion by their elemental Class. Collaborating through a covert network, the Summoner and Champions discovered crystalline fragments that seemed to be the Battlerealm's foundational cornerstone. Reconstructing the cornerstone would drain the ISO-Sphere's energy, preventing the Battlerealm from collapsing under its pressure. This did not go unnoticed by Grandmaster, who permitted the reconstruction only after the Summoner beat his game. It was then revealed that the cornerstone was actually the crystalized body of Carina Tivan, missing only one final piece.[34]\nIntimately familiar with their design, the Collector escaped his crystal, coinciding with Sentry's unanticipated return. Although Sentry succeeded in retrieving Carina's heart, theVoidovertook his mind in the decades prior and sought revenge. Following the Void's takedown by the Summoner, the Collector secured Carina's final piece.[17]The Collector tried to restore Carina's life with the remainder of his ISO-power but failed.[13]\nUnited to combat Thanos,[33]theIlluminatitraveled toDystopian WakandaforKillmonger's completedInfinity Claw. Using Killmonger's pride against him,Black Pantherchallenged him to Wakandan combat ritual without the gauntlet, winning and claiming the Infinity Claw for himself. Now armed with athird Infinity Stone, Thanos arrived the following week and engaged Black Panther in a cosmic battle, each wielding their respective gauntlets.[35]\nBattle of the Gauntlets\nBlack Panther eventually overpowered the Titan, trapping him in a nightmare[36]and scattering the Battlerealm's native Infinity Stones in the process, including the Illuminati's two stones.Helareleased Thanos and gifted him theDeath Stone, which he used to trap the Summoner and their allies into theDeath Realmwhile hisDeathlessclaimed the Infinity Stones unopposed.[37]\nMany heroes took refuge in theAstral Planeto escape the Mad Titan's cosmic wrath. With the completed Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos now superseded the Grandmaster, who pleaded for the Contest to continue. Uninterested, Thanos drained the ISO-Sphere and forced the Summoner to his side with mind control. Hela encouraged Thanos to massacre the entire Battlerealm, thoughMephistoargued that would immortalize them as martyrs. Plotting against Thanos, Mephisto volunteered to go with the Summoner under the guise of converting the Titan's opposition. In the Astral Plane, the Summoner was freed from Thanos' control and they teamed up with the combined efforts of Mephisto, theAvengers, Doctor Strange and M.O.D.O.K. to kill Thanos.[38][39]\nRebirth\nThe Infinity War caused the Grandmaster to lose a great deal of power and control.[13]The subsequent power vacuum enabled the rise of theCabal, a criminal organization secretly lead byDoctor Doom.[40][41]Seeking to restore his authority, the Grandmaster partnered withthe Championto repower the ISO-Sphere with ISO taken from his victims. This threatened Carina's essence that was scattered across the Battlerealm, prompting Ægon to return and subdue the Champion. Now driven to heal rather than fight, Ægon used the power within his ISO-Belt to bring Carina back to life.[13]\nWith her newfound ability to control ISO-8, Carina's rebirth alarmed those who considered her a progenitor of the Elder's oppression. Carina's reputation was further jeopardized when she accidentally produced a harmful flow of Black ISO-8 while trying to help the Avengers. Carina nonetheless found allies among those who understood her good intentions and the Summoner. Upon amending her mistake, Carina sensed the Battlerealm's instability and the impending threat of the Chronoserpent's return.[9]\nShortly after Carina's revival, analternate Thanoswho succeeded in his mission began exterminating other realities inside the Battlerealm with an army of his counterparts. WhenRoninwarned of the impending invasion, the Avengers rallied forces from across the Battlerealm's realities to overcome this second Thanos.[39]\nConcurrently, the process of reuniting the Fantastic Four began whenNight Thrasherseized a beacon from the Cabal that lead him to summoning the Silver Surfer from a wormhole.[15]After finding theThing, the bright minds of the Illuminati createdM.I.C.R.O.with the Surfer'sPower Cosmicto rescue theHuman Torch[42]andInvisible Woman.[43]Before he could be saved from his quantum prison built by the Cabal, Mister Fantastic reconfigured M.I.C.R.O. to lureGalactusto the Battlerealm. Thecosmic beingwould theoretically collapse the Battlerealm by devouring its core, providing its inhabitants the means to escape.[41]Upon learning from Carina that the core, Battleworld, harbored civilizations, Mister Fantastic began working to amend his mistake.[44]\nThe Grandmaster was outplayed by the Summoner with the aid of Carina and her allies. Just as the Collector began to boast, Carina warped him and the Grandmaster away, taking the ISO-Sphere and establishingher councilin their place, finally letting the Battlerealm's denizens lead themselves. After the council adjourned, Carina interrogated and threatened the malevolent Chronoserpent.[9][45]Behind the scenes, a group namedOuroborosbegan recruiting anyone willing to oppose Carina.[46]\nWho killed the Maestro?\nMany years elapsed on Battleworld since the Maestro's defeat thanks to its accelerated passage of time. Acting as the Chronoserpent's puppet, the Maestro conquered the divided Houses of Battleworld. The subjugated Barons colluded to secretly assassinate the Maestro with help from all of their alternate reality counterparts, demonstrating to the Chronoserpent that they could succeed the Maestro as tyrants.[6]After the Maestro's death, the Barons joined into theCouncil of Shawarmato deter the Houses from fighting again. When hostilities persisted, theWatcher's Summoners andAnathiinvestigated into the Maestro's death under the assumption that identifying the culprit would prevent war.[47][21]Battleworld's time synchronized with the Battlerealm's after the barrier between them was breached byKali, aSorcerer Supremefrom theTemple of Vishanti.[48]\nThe ISO-Sphere was taken by Kang the Conqueror and sent toGwenpool, prompting Carina and the Summoner to investigate its whereabouts. While Gwenpool caused tears in reality by toying with the ISO-Sphere, Kang used her mayhem to quickly dominate the Battlerealm. After securing the ISO-Sphere, the Summoner and Carina turned their focus against Kang, who sent a call for his alternate counterparts to support him.Superior Kang, the sole Kang to appear, effortlessly betrayed the other Kang and outpowered the Summoner, seizing control of the Battlerealm. Using the element of surprise from Carina's abilities and help from the betrayed Kang, the Summoner freed the Battlerealm from Superior Kang's grasp.[49]\nFollowing the release of Ikaris and Sersei from the crystal they were trapped in since the Battlerealm's inception, Mister Fantastic deduced from them that the Celestials also wished to keep Galactus out of the Battlerealm.[8]Tragically, time ran out when the Battlerealm was taken by surprise by a horde of Galactus variants.[50]Fortunately,Galan, a humane version of Galactus, proposed theWorld Seedas a solution to sustainably grow planets for their cosmic hunger.[51]\nOn Battleworld, the Barons revealed to Anathi that they all played a part in the Maestro's death. WhenAncient Oneelaborated by using hisTime Stoneto transport Anathi and himself to the Maestro's death,[52]the two were spotted byGlykhan, who abducted Anathi to the Chronoserpent's asteroid for questioning. Anathi received the Infinity Claw from Black Panther and exhausted its power to free herself, fusing her arm to the gauntlet's remnants. An alternateDoctor Strangesummoned Galactus to battle the Chronoserpent, forcing the Barons to have the planet evacuated.[6]Although some Battleworlders tried to fend them off, the planet was ultimately ruined.[53]\nMister Fantastic planted the World Seed on Battleworld after it was fully evacuated. By feeding it ISO-8 and energy fromPhoton, the Worldheart sprouted into a newWorld Tree, blooming into new worlds[54]and restoring consumed ones.[55]\nMeanwhile, Civil Warrior investigated Ouroboros and debriefed his findings to the Summoner and Carina. After defendingAvengers Towerfrom a coordinated attack, their continued investigation exposedScytalisas an undercover mole seeking to divide the Avengers. Following Scytalis' neutralization, Glykhan, the leader of Ouroboros, publicly revealed himself and his organization by hijacking the comms across the Battlerealm to call Carina's motives into question. When the broadcast was traced, the investigative team were lead intoBahamet's trap where they were publicly broadcasted. Although the Summoner overpowered Bahamet, the Council sought immediate explanation from Carina over the broadcast. Because Carina continuously resisted the Council and continued the investigation, the Council's leaders organized a summit to discuss what to do about Ouroboros and Carina's rogue team. Realizing that the Council was playing into Glykhan's hands by uniting the Battlerealm's leaders in one place, Carina teleported her team to the summit to warn them. As Carina's team rapidly presented all of their information on Ouroboros, Glykhan interrupted by revealing himself and unleashing his disguised Adaptoid army in the summit's crowd. Following Glykhan's defeat, the Chronoserpent spoke through Glykhan to offer the summit's audience its \"salvation\" before detonating Glykhan's body.[46]\nSome varieties of the Battlerealm's ISO-8\nAs the result of aCelestial's accident throughExo-Space, the Battlerealm is an abundant source ofNeutronium, most often found in the form of ISO-8, Neutronium's common isotope.[7][21][8]ISO permeates the atmosphere, powering the Battlerealm's residents through its radiation.[43]Fighting can produce more ISO-8 through a process called the churn, which strengthens the fighter while increasing their capacity to produce ISO-8. If the ISO levels hit a tipping point, the Battlerealm will explode into a newMultiverse. Conversely, the Battlerealm would gradually decay into its heat death without conflict.[46]\nAt the center of the Battlerealm is its core,Battleworld, that formed during the realm's creation. The quantities of Neutronium increases upon nearing the planet's atmosphere and concentrated core of Neutronium. On Battleworld, Neutronium exists with an extra nucleon in its ISO-9 form, which behaves exactly like ISO-8 when it should be unstable, held together by a mysterious force.[21]In the event of Battleworld's destruction, the rest of the Battlerealm would also collapse.[56]\nGreat disturbances of ISO-8 energy could be refined into newInfinity Stones.[32]The Battlerealm has its own unique set of Infinity Stones consisting of theGenesis,Evolution,War,Nightmare,ChaosandDeath Stones. Unlike foreign Infinity Stones that only resonate in the shards of their native dimension,[35][9]these Infinity Stones work anywhere in the Battlerealm[32]and are more powerful than their standard counterparts.[38]\nBecauseCarina Tivanwas caught in a blast from the dying Celestial who inadvertently created the Battlerealm, her essence is also tied to the Battlerealm's stability.[13]\nThe realities in the Battlerealm are divided space-time territories, each with their own Battleworld.[57][6]While some beings likeÆgonorMan-Thingcan jump across these realities, most are trapped in their own limited space-time pockets.[39][5]New territories are added as the Battlerealm sucks in debris from dying universes.[58][59]\nAlthough theTime Variance Authorityidentified the Battlerealm itself as a \"pocket timeline\",[60]it may also contain branching timelines of itself, as evidenced bySuperior Kang, who conquered the Battlerealm in a timeline without theSummoner.[49]Chronological brick walls impede time travel before or after the seventh Contest of Champions,[57]which is time-locked to the modern 21st century.[61]Despite this, there are territories that correspond to other periods of time such as theGolden,Silver,BronzeandCopper Ages.[62]\nOnce entered, the Battlerealm is difficult to traverse and nearly impossible to exit. While the outer space's atmosphere is breathable, the uninitiated traveler could find themselves sent back in time or long distances away in the wrong direction.[4]Even using the artificial portal network created by theCollectorandM.O.D.O.K.can prove to be hazardous.[32][63]ISO-Spherescan grant the ability to safely travel through and even exit the Battlerealm.[13]\nAmerica Chaveztheorized that the Battlerealm automatically spawns countless dimensional counterparts of anyone or anything that comes into it.[58]While this would contradict the Collector's efforts to capture Champions forMaestro,[18]her point was seemingly validated when alternate, malicious versions of herself andHercules, both newcomers to the Battlerealm, spawned to fight theSummoner.[58]\nCommunication in and out of the Battlerealm is possible.Dormammucould freely interact with the Battlerealm by possessing Champions, becoming trapped only after materializing himself within it.[33]By modifyingM.I.C.R.O.,Mister Fantasticbroadcasted a signal across the Multiverse, calling variants ofGalactusto the Battlerealm.[56]\nMap of the Battlerealm as of April 2022"

She succeeds in convincing Deadpool, mostly because the merc instantly falls in love with her. Once Deadpool is on his mission however, Black Widow confronts Nick Fury and demands to know why he didn't send her to help Chris and Cap. To this, Fury responds that right now, with Hawkeye having seemingly been killed byCrossbones, Black Widow is too emotional for such an important mission, and he doesn't want to sacrifice all his good agents. After Cap and Chris succeed in their mission and take the injured Deadpool back to the Helicarrier, Black Widow sees to it that his injuries are treated. When he tries a little too hard to flirt with her however, she gets fed up and kicks him out of the Helicarrier, into the ocean.[1]\nWhenSpider-Manwas possessed by theVenom symbioteand began to wreak havoc in New York, S.H.I.E.L.D. sent Black Widow to arrest him. Black Widow first savedEdward Grantwhen Spider-Man was about to attack the boy, and then fought Spider-Man herself. Despite the symbiote having enhanced Spider-Man's powers, Black Widow was able to give him a serious run for his money at the end Spider-Man trapped her in a pool of his weaving Thor also joined the fight, and drove Spider-Man off by accidentally exposing the symbiote by its only weakness, loud sound. Afterwards, Black Widow explained the Avengers and their partners, who had come to investigate Spider-Man's strange behavior, what was going on.[2]Spider-Man soon resumed his rampage and Black Widow fought him again, this time backed up by Captain America. They kept Spider-Man busy, until Hulk showed up with a large bell, which was used to separate Venom from Spider-Man. When Black Widow and Hulk tried to capture the symbiote however, it bonded with Hulk, forcing Black Widow and the Avengers to fight him. Eventually, they were able to separate Venom from Hulk as well and the symbiote was D-secured by Hikaru.[3]\nWhen theWorld Security Councilordered S.H.I.E.L.D. to arrest Dr.Hank Pymfor creating the robotUltron, which had gone rogue and wanted to conquer the world, Nick Fury had Black Widow dig up some dirt on the council members so he could blackmail them into letting S.H.I.E.L.D. handle the situation as they saw fit. This because Fury knew Pym to be innocent and that they needed him to take out Ultron.[4]\nAfterNozomu Akatsukireturned from the Dark Dimension as the villainous Ronin, Black Widow and Hawkeye were tasked with capturing him. They soon discovered that Ronin had no memories of being Professor Akatsuki. That is until Akira. wile worrying about his partner Iron Man (who had lost consciousness due to the dark energies from theDimension Sphere) unknowingly used his biocode to trigger Ronin's memories. Ronin told Black Widow and Hawkeye that they needed Dr. Strange to save Iron Man. Black Widow shared this information with the Avengers and helped them get Dr. Strange's DISK back fromManino Giordani.[5]"

The identity, origin and goals of the attackers was unknown. During the first war against these enemies, the heroes emerged victorious, but suffered heavy casualties, including most of theAvengers, theX-Men, theInhumans, theFantastic Four, theGuardians of the Galaxy, theChampionsand theRunaways.\nAfter the victory, the heroes relished in the hopefulness of their survival, and many of their descendants were born during this time, namelyKatie Barton(daughter ofHawkeyeandBlack Widow),Brigid Thorsdottir(daughter ofThor),Sora(daughter ofForgeandKwannon),Irene LeBeau(daughter ofRogueandGambit),Lucy Rand(daughter ofIron FistandMisty Knight), andFantomex 5. However, a second war abruptly took place, and most of the rest of the heroes were killed. As a result of the invasion, humanity became afflicted with some kind of sickness that decimated what was left of humanity and scattered the heroes to the winds.\nIn the end, the governments of the world nuked the surface of the planet to destroy the invaders. Some of the remaining heroes, includingSpider-Woman,Emma FrostandMagneto, and other survivors moved to an underground facility. The group was shielded byArmorfor over a year, andHazmatabsorbed and redirected radiation to create relatively habitable pockets on the surface where the most resilient of survivors could live for a time.[1]Discovering what had happened to the Earth during her absence, Captain Marvel struggled with survivor's guilt and ventured deep into the galaxy seeking to aid others in memory of her fallen friends. Over time, theSunstarted  dying, plunging the radioactive Earth into a global apocalyptic winter as well.\nIn 2051 A.D., Carol was surprised to learn of the existence of survivors when they contacted her for help to confront a mutated radioactive monster. Overjoyed to find some of her friends and their children still alive, Carol was able to come up with a way for her and the others to defeat and kill the creature. Carol subsequently sacrificed herself to save humanity by restarting the Sun, making the surface of the planet habitable again.[2]\nBy the following year, the survivors had started regaining the surface. They also learned of the existence of other groups of survivors, namely one led byOve.[1]Ove was the son ofNamorand theEnchantress, self-exiled to the surface with his mother after killing his father. Together they had established a haven in the ruins ofNew York CitycalledNew Atlantis, which was mantained with the powers of three subjugated superhumans, Armor,CrystalandJolt.[3]When Ove set out to travel to the past to rule unhindered by the dystopian circumstances of his own time, he enlisted the enslavedMagikto cast the necessary spell. In an attempt to stall Ove's plan, Magik claimed only the life force energy of Captain Marvel could be used to power the spell.[4]To this end, Ove had Magik pluck ayounger versionof Captain Marvel from the timeline ofEarth-616.[5]"

Unfortunately, almost everyone in New York, including the Avengers, were wearing a Doomstone and succumbed to cannibalism.\nLuckily, Black Widow andthe Punisherwere not wearing Doomstones and joined up with him in the hunt for any remaining Avengers, but with a jamming signal keeping them from contacting them, doing so was much harder. Their efforts were fruitless though, and during their search Natasha was kidnapped bySpider-Man, now referred to as Patient Zero.[5]\nAt some point, she succumbed to the plague herself and became a part of Patient Zero's tribe. Years later, Patient Zero's mateMary Jane Watsonwas kidnapped bythe King of Deathand the Punisher was called on to save her. Patient Zero did not send him in alone, though.

Dylan Brock wakes up late one night to find Anne Weying, an alternate version of his late mother and Agent Venom from another universe, standing over him. Saying she doesn't have much time to explain, Anne claims that after Dylan and Eddie left, she spent years waiting for her son - the Dylan Brock of her universe - to awaken from the coma he'd been left in after his connection to Knull was severed. Finally, Anne gave up hope... only to discover one day that the Carnage symbiote had abandoned Cletus Kasady and was seeking Dylan's comatose body as its next host. Restoring the powers Dylan possessed as Codex, Carnage quickly conquered the world, killing nearly everyone and keeping a handful of people - Anne included - alive to torture.

Later, Dylan sits next to a comatose Eddie Brock, who is intubated in a hospital bed, and tells him that he has been able to sense that Dylan and Ana's alternate codices have merged inside the symbiote Hive-Mind. Shedding tears, Dylan says that Eddie has suffered enough from the return of his cancer, and that he can always see him again in the Hive.[64]\nDylan Brocklived the same story as hisEarth-1051counterpartto some extent.

Disguised as Anne, Carnage quickly gained the upper hand and badly wounded Dylan, infecting Venom with an offshoot of his symbiote. However, Dylan's dormant powers reawakened and he used them to summon a horde of symbiotes that forced the Carnage symbiote off of his counterpart's body, which had been reduced into a desiccated corpse under the creature's control. Using his powers, Dylan then obliterated the Carnage symbiote.[64]\nWhen a time-travellerDoctor Doomtried to change the past to saveValeria's life, he fought against all of the superheroes of Earth and killed them all, including Dylan.[2]"

She was trained in hand to hand combat and weapons usage. She trained in English and western culture. In 1937, the unnamed girl appeared to strike up a friendship with another girl in the program, but later killed her during a sparring match when her tutor ordered her to do so.[4]\nIn 1944, she stood beside Fyodor as he greeted four men, including Ivchenko, who were chosen to join Leviathan. She removed the bags from the bound men's heads so that they could see. When one of the men refused to join Leviathan, she stabbed him in the jugular vein and toppled his chair with a kick. In 1946, the unnamed woman took the alias of Ida Emke to seduceHoward Starkand learn his secrets. After learning of his vault containing technology too dangerous to be used and passed the information onto Leviathan, Ida vacated her apartment.[3][2]\nSix months later, Dottie Underwood was the newest resident on the Griffith Hotel inNew York, she joined after the eviction of Molly Bowden. Dottie and LandladyMiriam Frypassed byPeggy CarterandAngie Martinelliwhile the two were reeling from a hard day at their respective jobs. Ms. Fry stated that Dottie was in New York to train as a ballerina.[5]\nUnderwood ate supper with the other women of the Griffith Hotel as Peggy, Carol, and Angie stuffed purses with food. Underwood asked one tenant to construct for her a purse that could hold pickles, as the women discussed the different methods they used to transport food to their rooms. Later that evening, when she stepped out of her door, she found Otto Mink in the hallway. He told Underwood to return to her room, before pressing the point by training his gun on her. Underwood noted that it was an automatic pistol, and promptly killed him with a set of acrobatic moves, before claiming his firearm for herself and moving his body under her bed.[6]\nMeeting up with Peggy Carter at the L&L Automat the following morning, Underwood expressed her desire to see the city, marking several prominent locations like Central Park and the Empire State Building on a map. In response, Carter stated they were \"tourist traps\" and recommended Underwood start with Brooklyn instead, to get to know the city's people. Underwood then \"accidentally\" caused Carter's purse to fall off the table - she quickly picked up the items that spilled out, but pocketed the key to Carter's room.\nAfter Carter had gone to work, Underwood entered the agent's room using the key and began thoroughly searching it. Discovering a hidden compartment in the wardrobe, she pulled out a box that contained photos of Howard Stark's recovered inventions. Taking one of the pictures, Underwood then put back the box, placing everything exactly as it originally was, and moved to the vanity, where she observed a photo of pre-serum Steve Rogers. After briefly assuming Carter's bearing and accent, Underwood exited the room, carefully placing the string that Carter had in the lock as she closed the door. That evening, Underwood handcuffed herself to the headboard of her bed, as she always did since her days at the Red Room Academy.\nThe next day, Underwood took the subway to a dentist office across the street from the New York Bell Company. The dentist working there assumed she was there for an interview and invited her in. During the interview he touched her leg and indicated he wanted a sexual favor from her. She killed the dentist by drilling into his eyeball then set up a high powered rifle in his office window. Underwood aimed her rifle at the office window of Roger Dooley as he interviewed Doctor Ivchenko. As Ivchenko stood by the window, she sent beams of light for him to see. He sent back a coded message that Underwood translated; Peggy Carter was to be killed.\nUnderwood returned to the Griffith Hotel as Strategic Scientific Reserve agents Jack Thompson and Daniel Sousa were leading a raiding party to capture Carter. She saw Carter as Carter was attempting to leave the building. Underwood asked her if she joined her for diner. After Peggy declined Dottie gave her a hug and then suddenly kissed her full on the lips; she had a coating of Sweet Dreams Lipstick on her lips. A suprised Carter noticed the scar on her wrist from the handcuffs, but then started to pass out. Dottie pulled out her switchblade and prepared to kill Carter, but got interrupted by Thompson and Sousa seeing them. When Thompson and Sousa saw the unconscious agent, Underwood told them that she found Carter like that. Underwood watched as Carter was arrested. Afterwards, Angie Martinelli entered her room to announce a meeting that Miriam Fry was holding; Underwood had abandoned it.\nUnderwood went to a store and purchased a baby carriage, telling the salesperson that she wanted a pink blanket to go inside. The salesperson remarked that she must not be far along in her pregnancy, because she was not showing; Underwood silently quipped that she had an arrival coming soon. She then returned to Seth Honicky's Dentist Office where Ivchenko informed her through a Morse code message that she needed to prep for evacuation.\nLeaving the office, Underwood saw Agent Daniel Sousa inspecting various offices in the building. She attempted to walk silently past him, but she was discovered. They fought until Sousa managed to recover his gun; running to the stairs, she was seen by another Strategic Scientific Reserve agent holding a gun. Underwood used the banister of the stairwell to jump down ten flights to the bottom floor. She killed the agent waiting there for her, procured a car, and met with Ivchenko who was carrying Item 17. Learning that Item 17 needed to be tested after its long dormancy, Underwood placed it in the baby carriage and activated it within a movie theater.\nDottie and Ivchenko drove in the car while they discussed the city, while Ivchenko is impressed by the city Dottie considers it like any other. A police officer pulled them over as Ivchenko tells her not to attract attention. Using her innocent persona Dottie managed to convince the officer to not give them a ticket. As the officer prepared to leave his radio informed him to search for a woman matching Dottie her description and the car she is driving. As he went for his gun Dottie quickly held him at gunpoint and captured him. Ivchenko and Dottie got to the hangar of Howard and she quickly killed an employee who tried to stop them. Ivchenko learned of the return of Howard Stark and tells her they will go back to the city.\nAs Howard Stark held a press conference Dottie installed a rigged riffle to shoot at Stark. She then killed the two police officers at his car and Ivchenko hypnotised the captured cop to drive Stark away as he flees in the car. Dottie later killed the hypnotised cop and she and Ivchenko took a captured Stark away by car. Dottie reminded Stark of that they spent a weekend together, as he remembered who she was she hits him with the gun. At the hangar Dottie tied him to a chair and beats him while he tried to remember her name. Ivchenko confronted Howard and told him how his Item 17 killed countless Russian soldiers during the war including his brother, while Ivchenko could only watch. Ivchenko then hypnotised Howard to make him fly a plane to spread Item 17.\nIvchenko and Dottie staid in contact with Howard over the radio as he flied the plane. Carter comes in with a shotgun and confronts them. Dottie quickly disarmed her with a kick and knocked the SSR Agent down. Dottie tried to kill her with her switchblade however Carter disarmed her with a sheet. Dottie ordered Ivchenko to go as she fought Carter and quickly overpowered her. Dottie mentioned that she used to be jealous at girls like Peggy, however now she can be anyone she wants. Dottie prepared to bludgeon Carter with a baseball bat, however Carter manages to kick her out of a broken window. Dottie fell hard on a plane wing and kept laying down while bleeding. When Carter came down, Dottie's body had disappeared.\nUnderwood is a cold-blooded operative. Trained from a young age to be a ruthless killer and a spy, Underwood kills her targets, and anyone in her way, without any doubt. This was shown as she even killed another girl during sparring when she was a child, after her tutor ordered her. Underwood is able to assume the guise of a harmless and innocent woman while completely hiding her true nature. She can fake multiple emotions to trick her victims before killing them. Underwood was even able to befriend and trick Peggy, catching her completely off guard."

The survivors managed to synthesize mutant healing factors into creating a serum with some limited success in halting the spread of the Vi-Lock virus, but were unable to cure those already affected.\nTheExileswere charged with retrieving the body of Douglas Ramsey, held in stasis by Forge within the Vi-Lock base, in the hopes that access to the original strain might allow the surviving uninfected scientists to find a cure. They failed in their mission, after Forge became aware of their plan and destroyed Ramsey.\nThey received a new mission to ensure the planet's destruction, since the Vi-Locks would eventually spread across the universe, but were able to find another solution; they summoned theAsgardians, who had not been present onEarthduring the modern age. Their own healing factors were used to bolster the existing serum, making it strong enough to cure the Vi-Lock strain."

JonesFirstMarvel Fanfare#10(June, 1983)\nThe Black Widow Ops Program (Программа спецотряда \"Чёрная вдова\") was one of theDepartment X's espionage training programs, which played a critical role inNatalia Romanova's life. Based at theRed Roomfacility, it had been aCold Warprogram to train the deadliest female spy in the world. It was created due to the success of their previous sleeper agent and assassin, theWinter Soldier.[1]\nRed Room training\nThe Black Widow Ops Program didn't simply use training, but also employed biochemical enhancements for its agents and also implanted them with false memories reminiscent of those used by theWeapon Plus Program.[1]Department X recruited 28 little orphan girls to make them undetectable deep-cover agents to infiltrateChinaand the West. The core methodology was designed byProfessor Grigor Pchelintsov, a leader in the field of psychotechnics, and allowed for imprinting people with almost completely fabricated memories.[1]They were made to believe that they were trained in ballet in theBolshoi Theatre.[2][3]Natasha was placed with a handler,Ivan Petrovitch.\nFurthermore, the girls all received a special treatment designed byDr. Lyudmila Kudrin, a biochemist. The Kudrin treatment could make women stay young for many decades, as well as superhumanly healthy and resilient.[3]\nNiko Constantinwas the only male trainee of the Red Room's male equivalent dubbed \"Wolf Spider\", Niko Constantin proved to be an effective killer, but impossible to handle or control, leading to the program to be declared a failure. Years later, he was found to be imprisoned in a Russian gulag, leading a gang of convicts dubbed the Wolf Spiders, and holding a grudge against James \"Bucky\" Barnes, one of the trainers for the Wolf Spider program.[4]\nTheK.G.B.continued the Black Widow Ops Program at the Red Room in the late 1970's. The new Black Widow program was making a reality out of the disinformation, thus helping hide what the real project had been. This Red Room program successfully trained their agent,Yelena Belova, though she soon left the service.[5]\nNatasha, weary of espionage and adventure, retired toArizonabut was targeted, as were the other Black Widow subjects of the Red Room, by theNorth Instituteon behalf of the corporationGynacon. Natasha's investigations led her back toRussia, where she was appalled to learn the previously unimagined extent of her past manipulation, and she discovered the Widows were being hunted because Gynacon, having purchased Russian biotechnology from Red Room's successor agency 2R, wanted all prior users of the technology dead. After killing Gynacon CEOIan McMasters, she clashed with operatives of multiple governments to helpSally Anne Carter, a girl Natasha had befriended in her investigations, whom she rescued with help fromDaredeviland Yelena Belova.[6]\nRed Room Massacre\nThe Red Room was the site of mass killings of K.G.B recruits. Surveillance video revealed the killings were carried out by theDark Ocean Societylead by a new Ronin.[7]However before their investigation was completed the group was attacked by theSupreme Sovietsand were forced to split up.[8]Hawkeyeand Black Widow traveled to Sapporo,Japan, the base of operations of the Dark Ocean Society; andMockingbirdandDominic Fortuneheaded to the tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula following mass Russian troop movements.[9]The group reunited on the disputedKuril Islandsand discovered the identity of the new Ronin to beAlexei Shostakov, the original Red Guardian and Black Widow's ex-husband. Shostakov revealed he intended to force a war between Russia and Japan to restore Russia's former glory. A battle ensued as the heroes took on a combination of the Dark Ocean Society and the Supreme Soviets. During the battle Hawkeye received a critical blow to the head, but Widow however managed to take down Shostakov with the help ofFantasma.[10]\nThe Red Room was reformed years later, and an American branch overseen byAlexander Cady[11]was established inWestchester County,New York.[12]In addition to continuing the original Red Room training program, this base delved into a cloning program with the objective to have at its disposal exact replicas of their best agents. A clone of Natasha Romanoff was created shortly after her death at the hands ofCaptain America. Even though her handler Cady intended her only to possess memories related to her service at the Red Room,Ursa Majorsecretly interfered in the process that was supposed to give her only a selected few of the original Natasha Romanoff's memories.\nThe clone went on to target the remnants of bothHydraandS.H.I.E.L.D., while keeping a secret the fact that she remembered the entire life of her previous self. Black Widow eventually investigated the Red Room and found out about the cloning program and that she was a clone herself. Natasha started working against her handlers after Ursa Major urged her to destroy the Red Room and put an end to their operations. After faking the death of one of her targets, ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agentSally Blevins, Natasha killed Alexander Cady and pinned his murder on the Winter Soldier to throw her superiors for a loop.[11]"

        "content": "X-Men ForeverGalleryOfficial NameEarth-161StatusExistingCreators and AppearancesCreatorsChris Claremont,Tom GrummettFirstX-Men Forever: Alpha#1(May, 2009)\nEarth-161 is a reality that generally mirrorsEarth-616in much of its past. However, there are key divergences that center around this reality's version of theX-MenandMutantsin general. In particular is the fact that mutants, with a few exceptions, all suffer from what is referred to as \"Mutant Burn Out\" in which their mutant powers will eventually cause their bodies to burn out, ending their lives prematurely. It is theorized that, on average, Burn Out has prevented mutants from living longer than 60 years.[1]\nThere are a number of familial differences that are unique to Earth-161. For example, on Earth-161 evidence suggests thatWolverineis the biological son ofSabertooth.[2]In addition, the Trask family stretches back toWorld War IIandNazi Germany, starting with patriarch and scientistDietrich Trask. His contemporary descendants includeBolivar Traskand his two children, Larry andZigfried(with his wifeAmelia Trask).[3]Also in this reality, the Stark and Trask families are cousins.[4]It also appears that most of theHowling Commandos, with the exception ofNick Fury, have either died or retired and have been succeeded by their children and/or grandchildren inS.H.I.E.L.D.[1]Also unique to this reality is the nature ofMr. Sinister. In this reality he is a nearly immortal mutant trapped in the body of a young boy and the form most commonly encountered by the X-Men was nothing more than an artificial construct.[5]Also in this reality, the name of the X-Man known as Gambit isRemy Picardas opposed to \"Remy LeBeau\" as in most other realities.[6]Another difference is in that of theAsgardianthunder-godThor. During this period on Earth-616 the mantle of Thor was carried byEric Masterson. In this reality, while Thor resembles Masterson, he speaks like the true Thor. As the real Thor on Earth-616 was dormant within Masterson at the time, this would suggest that the fusion of the two beings on Earth-161 is slightly different.[7]\nA number of events in the past and during the modern age of Earth-161 mirror that of Earth-616 in most respects with a number of exceptions.\nDuring World War II, the Nazis amassed a number of strange technologies, likely of alien origin, in order to retrofit them for their war effort. Among the scientists they hired to partake in these explorations was Dietrich Trask who began pioneering a method of detecting differences in the human genetic structure without the use of a standard blood test, the precursor to his descendant's work that would eventually lead to the invention of theSentinelrobots. This operation was destroyed and Dietrich was assassinated thanks to a joint American/British mission which includedNick Furyand hisHowling Commandosas well as Captain Logan (later Wolverine) of the Canadian military.[8]\nAnother major difference in this reality is thatHoward Starkwas a bigot who sought to eliminate the mutant race and was responsible for relocating the Trask family to South America so that they could continue their family research which eventually led to the creation of the Sentinels. Stark help fund theConsortium, an organization that intended to monitor and eventually wipe out the Mutant race.[4]When Howard Stark passed away, his sonTonywas eventually brought into the Consortium, however as he was the heroic Iron Man, he secretly sought to take down the Consortium from within.[9]\nOutcomes of some of the X-Men's past battles occurred differently, such as whenPsylockewas transformed into Lady Mandarin during theActs of Vengeancecrisis. On Earth-616 this process was facilitated with the help of theMojoverse'sSpiraland her Body Shoppe;[10]however, in this reality it was revealed that the transformation was performed by theHandclan of ninja assassins using a combination of science and magic.[11]During the so-calledX-Tinction Agenda, like on Earth-616, many of the X-Men and their associates were captured by theMagistratesofGenoshato answer for crimes against their nation. This also included the X-Men's leaderStormwho at the time had been de-aged to that of a young woman just entering into adolescence. Like on Earth-616, Storm was instrumental in helping the X-Men,New Mutants, and X-Factor defeatCameron Hodge. On Earth-616, Storm was merely restored to her adult form during the course of the conflict;[12]however, on Earth-161 events occurred in a much more complicated fashion.\nIn this reality, Genoshan Genegineer,David Moreauhad Storm pose as aGenoshan Mutate, secretly spiriting her away while Hodge was otherwise preoccupied battling the X-Men, in order to plot against Hodge. With Storm's powers cancelled out by the Press Gang's Wipeout, Moreau instead had aBio-Synthof Storm that would retain all her powers, as well as those from Wipeout, until such a time Storm's true powers could be restored. However an unexpected side effect caused the Bio-Synth to grow rapidly into adulthood, prompting Moreau to have his minionPipelineswitch Storm with her Bio-Synth in the middle of battle to make it appear that Storm had suddenly reverted to her adult form with her full mutant powers. In reality, the Bio-Synth took Storm's place and the real Storm was stored on Pipeline's terminal to be freed later. However this did not come to pass as both Moreau and Pipeline were killed in the destruction of the Magistrates' headquarters in the aftermath of the battle, leaving no one alive who knew about the switch. The X-Men were unaware that the Storm that continued to fight alongside them was a bio-duplicate of their true friend. The Consortium gained access to Pipeline's terminal and used it to restore Storm from the data-stream, however without Pipeline to facilitate the process it was incomplete creating a version of Storm which had little-to-no memories of her life before meetingGambit. The restoration also caused an energy form of the true Storm, with all her memories, to materialize on Genosha. It was located by Iron Man who confided in her his attempts to take down the Consortium from within, and after outfitting her with a unit to maintain her cohesion, he had the true Storm lay low until they could finalize their plans. Meanwhile, the X-Men continued their adventures nearly identical to those of their Earth-616 counterparts, with the exception of the fact that the Storm that they fought with was not their true friend. As a result, when the X-Men later battled onMuir Islandagainst theShadow King, the biosynth of Storm was affected by the Shadow King's evil influence and soon after was contacted by, and began acting as an agent of, the Consortium in their plots against the X-Men.[9]\nAnother stark difference between Earth-161 and Earth-616 surrounds that ofScott Summers'sonNathan. As on Earth-616, Nathan was kidnapped and brought to the moon byApocalypse. However, whereas on Earth-616 young Nathan was infected with aTechno-Organic Virusand was sent into the distant future where he eventually became the future soldier known as Cable,[13]on this reality events occurred differently: Although the whole situation has yet to be detailed, it has been stated that Nathan was rescued thanks toArchangel'sgirlfriendCharlotte Jones, changing the course of history.[7]After the encounter, Cyclops had sent his son toAlaskawhere he grew up under the care of his great-grandparents, hisspace pirate grandfather, and his team of alienStarjammers.[14]Complicating things is the fact that this reality has its own version ofCable, whose origins and motivations are largely unknown and speculative at best.[15]\nThe final alterations to the general history between Earth-161 and Earth-616 before the major divergences between the two occurred during the final conflict between the X-Men, Magneto and the newly formed Acolytes onAsteroid M.[16]In this reality, Magneto and his Acolytes died (and unlike their Earth-616 counterparts, have apparently perished for good) whileFabian Cortezmanaged to escape via an escape pod, leading to a worldwide manhunt for Cortez spearheaded by SHIELD with the X-Men's assistance.[17]\nFollowing the defeat of Magneto, Wolverine andJean Greywere sent to investigate Hand activity on a tropical island. There the pair began a romantic relationship prior to being captured by the Hand who attempted to turn them into Hand assassins, however they were saved by their fellow X-Men and since kept their romance a secret from the others.[11]With the aid of SHIELD, the X-Men continued their manhunt for Fabian Cortez with the assistance of Excalibur membersNightcrawlerandShadowcat. The group succeeded in capturing Cortez and turned him over to SHIELD, but not before a collision of powers between Cortez, Wolverine, and Shadowcat inadvertently caused one of Logan's claws and his DNA to transfer into Kitty's body, slowly granting her powers similar to his own.[6]Shortly after the team's return to the X-Mansion, Logan discovered the youthful Storm (later named 'Ro) in Storm's room and the Bio-Synth murdered him in secret. Logan's father Sabertooth then went to the mansion to get revenge against Storm, but she blinded him with a lightning strike that his mutant powers could not heal due to the early stages of Burn Out.[2]When the X-Men realized that \"Storm\" had betrayed them, a battle broke out and Shadowcat learned that one of Logan's claws was implanted in her body, which she then used to scar Storm's face. By this point the Consortium sought to eliminate Storm in order to hide their involvement, but failed to do so and Storm managed to escape.[18]\nThe Storm Bio-Synth fled toWakandawhere she was granted asylum by theBlack Pantherwho was also fooled into thinking that she was the real Storm. Using T'Challa's feelings for the real Storm to trick him into proposing to her, Storm conspired with his old foeErik Killmongerto assassinate the entire Wakandan royal family including T'Challa, and in the end betrayed Killmonger in order to make it appear that Killmonger acted alone so that the Wakandan people would accept her as their beloved ruler. The ruse worked and effigies of the Panther god were torn down and replaced with statues of their new leader whom they dubbed \"Perfect Storm\".[19]\nIn the interim, the X-Men discovered the Mutant Burn Out epidemic and the fact that their leaderCharles Xavierhad been hiding it from them for years. Also at this time the Consortium had fully compromised SHIELD and used their inside agents to assist in the freeing of Fabian Cortez.[1]The X-Men were soon dispatched to South America where Sentinels were sighted.[8]Leading to their discovery of a Consortium facility operated by Zigfried \"Ziggy\" Trask,[3]however during the clash, Ziggy and herNeo-Sentinelsmanaged to escape the X-Men.[20]The Consortium then began completing their construction on a satellite armed with a weapon that would wipe out the mutant race from the face of the Earth.[14]The X-Men later came to the aid of their former teammateColossusand theBlack Widowin a clash withCossack,[21]but failed to stop him from transforming Colossus' sisterIllyanaback into the evil Black Magik.[22]The X-Men defeated the Cossack and Black Magic, but Black Magic managed to escape, promising to terrorize the X-Men anew in the future.[23]\nMeanwhile,Mystiquetricked her children Nightcrawler andRogueinto traveling to South Carolina thinking they were coming to help Kurt's ex-girlfriendAmanda Sefton. A fight broke out leading to Rogue being injured enough for Nightcrawler to attempt mouth-to-mouth, the resulting contact caused the pair to switch mutant powers permanently, which was Mystique's plan the whole time in order to save Rogue from the Burn Out due to Mystique and Kurt's unique genetics.[24]. By this time Nick Fury discovered that the Consortium had infiltrated SHIELD and mobilized a covert strike with Sabertooth andDaisy Dugan.[25]During their assault on a Consortium base, they uncovered experiments being conducted on Fabian Cortez who was dying from Burn Out, as well as Tony Stark's involvement with the organization and their orbital platform.[26]The X-Men launched an assault on the Consortium Orbital Platform,[4]once more clashing with Ziggy Trask and her Neo-Sentinels.[27]In the aftermath of the battle, Tony Stark revealed his intentions to take down the Consortium from within and sacrificed his life along with the Beast in order to destroy the orbital platform before it could wipe out the mutant race, seemingly killing Amelia and Ziggy Trask and destroying the last of the Neo-Sentinels in the process.[28]The X-Men then suffered yet another loss when a data breach ofShi'arcaused by Charles Xavier allowed theWarskrullsto attack the Shi'ar empire.Empress Lilandrasent herImperial Guardto Earth where they clashed with the X-Men until Charles Xavier ended the battle by agreeing to surrender to the Shi'ar for punishment.[7]\nFollowing this, the Consortium used their ties within SHIELD to convince theAvengersthat the X-Men were responsible for Iron Man's death. However during the battle, Shadowcat used a combination of Shi'Ar technology and Lila Cheney's Tesseract tech to make it appear that the entire X-Mansion and the X-Men were destroyed in a massive explosion, while in reality they were brought out of synch with reality. Safely hidden in plain view the X-Men, Nick Fury, and the remaining SHIELD agents loyal to Fury then continued their mission to bring down the Consortium.[5]Upon Fury's death, Ziggy Trask (having survived) was appointed as director of SHIELD whileMr. Sinisterbegan taking efforts to capture Cyclops's son Nathan, whileArchangelgathered the remaining mutants loyal to the X-Men in order to bring them underground so they could deal with the threat of Burn Out. Having grown tired of living in secrecy, Rogue briefly left the X-Men's sanctuary and for a time fought crime in New York withSpider-Man,[15]before being pulled back into the fold.[29]Soon afterMoira MacTaggertand Sabertooth were captured by the last survivingMorlocksseeking a cure from Burn Out from the former and revenge for theMutant Massacrefrom the latter.[30]However the X-Men intervened bringing the Morlocks toGenoshawhere they allied with theGhost Pantherin a revolution of the region which was under threat of invasion from Perfect Storm, while the X-Men narrowly avoided being discovered by SHIELD as still being alive.[31]\nMr. Sinister then sent hisMarauders(along with a clone ofSabertooth) to capture Nathan Summers, clashing with the Starjammers.[32]Corsair managed to escape and rallied the X-Men who clashed with the Marauders. During the fight Shadowcat was gravely wounded by a clone ofWolverine.[33]The X-Men succeeded in slaying all the Marauders, save for the Wolverine clone who survived. With their mission seemingly a success, half the team returned to the mansion while the rest decided to remain in Alaska.[34]Discovering that the clone is still alive, Shadowcat tracked it to Japan with 'Ro where they presumed that it plotted to attack Logan's former lover,Mariko Yashida. Upon their arrival they discovered that theSilver Samurai, apparently acting for his sister, was aligning the Yashida clan withMatsu'o Tsurayaba'sHand.[35]However a subsequent clash with the Wolverine clone led to Kitty and 'Ro's arrest. They were freed by Mariko who turned them over to SHIELD director Ziggy Trask, revealing that she was now part of the Consortium, having decided to join in revenge for Logan leaving her for Jean Grey, and the X-Men allowing him to die. The Consortium then offered 'Ro to Perfect Storm in exchange for an alliance in her bid to take over Genosha.[36]"

However, the members of the Herd survived and hid the Key away, passing down their titles throughout the ages and making sure to manipulate empires in order to keep themselves in power.[1]\nThousands of years later,Steve Rogersfought inWorld War IIasCaptain America.[2]among his allies was the Black Panther and king of Wakanda: Azzuri the Wise the grandfather to the present King and Black Panther T’Challa.[3]\nIn the modern age, aS.H.I.E.L.D.scientist[4]namedGeorge Tarletonfound strange crystals in the San Francisco Bay while looking for forms of renewable energy. Unbeknownst to him, the crystals had been brought to Earth by a massiveKree Sentrylying on the bottom of the Bay.[3]\nTarleton named these crystalsTerrigen Crystals, and began looking for investors to help him develop technology that would harness these crystals. He failed to impress the modern-dayZodiac, though he would later find an investor inTony Stark. Around this time, beings of superhuman capabilities began appearing on Earth extremely frequently after a long period of absence, which Tarleton saw as unnatural.[1][3]\nAmong these superhuman beings were the costumed heroes known as theAvengers, who had banded together to defeat the evil Asgardian known asLoki. The Avengers defended the Earth from various threats, such as alien invasions, robot armies and the villainous superhuman group known as theLethal Legion, as well as non-superhuman mercenaries such asBatroc the LeaperandTaskmaster.[5][2][6]\nThe Avengers did battle with the Zodiac, aided by the current Sorcerer Supreme,Doctor Strangeand his alliesDoctor VoodooandWong, as well as CommanderMaria Hillof S.H.I.E.L.D. After the Avengers' conflict with the Zodiac, Stark was inspired to begin working on teleportation technology, due to both the Zodiac and Doctor Strange having the ability.[1][7]\nTarleton and fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. scientistMonica Rappaccini[4]had started their own company calledAdvanced Idea Mechanics, or A.I.M. for short while working for S.H.I.E.L.D.[1]Tarleton had Rappaccini reach out to former college classmate and AvengerBruce Banner, which is how A.I.M. had landed Tony Stark as an investor.\nThis rekindling of their friendship led to Banner and Rappaccini striking up a romance and partnership, with both working on studying Banner's gamma radiation. While Banner hoped their work could cure him, Rappaccini hoped their work could give Banner conscious control over the Hulk, as well as create other conscious beings like the Hulk, in addition to helping regrow lost limbs. This led to Rappaccini secretly experimenting on A.I.M.'s head of security, Emil Blonsky, resulting in his transformation into theAbomination.[4][1]\nStark desired to expand the Avengers membership and start a West Coast branch of their team, a desire which only became stronger after the Avengers' battle with the Zodiac, and became shared byCaptain America. Due to wanting to move from New York City to San Francisco to be with Rappaccini, Banner agreed.[1]\nIn order to celebrate the grand opening of the Avengers' West Coast headquarters, as well as S.H.I.E.L.D. and A.I.M.'s Terrigen-powered Helicarrier named theChimera, all three organizations held a festival called \"A-Day\", and held a fan fiction contest, where the winners would get a special place of honor at A-Day. Among these winners was 11-year oldKamala Khan.[1][3]\nThe glorious celebration of A-Day would be turned into a great tragedy though when an explosion rocked the Golden Gate Bridge. the Avengers mobilized to combat masked terrorists on the bridge. However while they were distracted, their Helicarrier engaged its auto-pilot as someone initiated its security protocols. Once the ship was airborne, Captain America boarded it to investigate, but quickly realized its energy source was overloaded and ordered an immediate evacuation of all civilians on board. The ship then exploded in a huge shock wave, and the Chimera crashed into the bay. The resulting aftermath came to fruition in the form of countless dead with Captain America assumed to be one of the victims as well and many, including Kamala herself, included gaining various powers and being labeled “Inhuman” by the public. The Avengers despite their efforts to stop it were blamed for parading around dangerous technology and along with the testimony of Dr. Bruce Banner AKA The Hulk that the Avengers did indeed pose a danger to society the team was disbanded and went their separate ways into reclusion. In their stead former ally of the Avengers Dr. George Tarleton and his company A.I.M filled the void with numerous robots and drones."

Pragmatically speaking, this means that most of the events, history, and character history associated with the heroes of Earth-616 happened 15 years before they would have on Earth-616, but the overall political, technological, and sociological progress of the world is exactly concurrent with Earth-616. As such, a lot of the superheroes of the past have either grown up, grown old, or retired, and now new groups and new superheroes are proving themselves in protecting the world.[1]\nBy this timeSpider-Manhas retired, having lost his right leg in the final battle withNorman Osbornfollowing theGathering of Five. The Avengers had disbanded for several years, and the Fantastic Four has now become theFantastic Five.[2][3]Younger heroes likeNovahave become seasoned veterans, while others such asCassie LangandKristoff Vernardhave risen to prominence.[4]\nWhile the main point of divergence from Earth-616 is early arrival of the Age of Heroes, this leads to many other smaller deviations from the main Marvel continuity. One example lies in the more catastrophic outcome of the Gathering of Five. Also, on Earth-616 Peter and Mary Jane Parker had a daughter, who they believed to be stillborn; on Earth-982, the child survived, but was kidnapped by Norman Osborn.Kaine, a clone of Peter Parker rescued her and returned her to her parents. She later grew up to becomeSpider-Girl.[5]\nCain Marko (Juggernaut)andSachi Yamaalso had a child,Zane Yama. Zane grew up without his father (who was trapped in a parallel universe), but knew of his role as the Juggernaut. When he inherited a portion of his father's power, he decided to become the costumed crime-fighter,J2.[6]Similarly,WolverineandElektrahad a daughter, Rina who becameWild Thing, andFlash ThompsonandFelicia Hardy(Black Cat) have a daughter,Felicity.[7][8]\nFeatures the adventures of Spider-Girl,Darkdevil,Fantastic Five, a new group ofAvengers,the Buzz, and others.\nThis reality got briefly destroyed during theincursionsand was salvaged byGod Emperor Doomas part of theBattleworld'sMC2domain, but it later got brought back to normal.[9]"

In the Earth-616 timeline, Korvac sensed doubt within her and that caused him to lose the will to live and abandon life. However, in this reality,Carinasuppressed her doubts and returned his love with all her strength, renewing his energy and givingKorvacthe power he needed to vaporize those last four heroes and then Moondragon, who had wished to join his cause. Working together, Korvac and Carina then swiftly sealed off Earth from all the godly and ungodly realms that were adjacent to it, and from all time-travelers, includingImmortus. Korvac then dealt with the remaining internal threats by banishing Doctor Strange, Jean Grey/Phoenix and the Silver Surfer. Korvac also investigated theCelestialFourth Hostbut left them alone when he discovered that they would not interfere because it might affect their ongoing fifty-year judgment of mankind.[1]\nKorvac then went on the offensive, and he and his recreated minions managed to kill a number of the universe's most powerful beings. Among them wasGalactus, whom Korvac hadCaptain Americause theUltimate Nullifierto eliminate at the cost of his own life. During another battle, theMoonwas shattered and its debris formed a ring around Earth. Eventually, theLiving Tribunaldeclared that the crimes that Korvac had committed against the cosmic balance of that universe were so great that he had to take action and mete out justice himself. The Living Tribunal then delivered his ultimate punishment by causing Earth'sSunto go nova, but Korvac was powerful enough to shield Earth from destruction. Concluding that he could do no more and must give that universe up for lost, the Living Tribunal departed, sealing Earth-82432 off from all others lest its evil spread.[1]\nAt some point during (or perhaps before) these events, a divergent counterpart ofEarth-616's Living Laserhad arrived from some unspecified alternate Earth, having become lost in the multiverse while trying to return to his rightful reality. After becoming aware of what was going on in this reality, the Laser chose to fly out into space in an attempt to get as far away from Earth as possible.[2]\nSoon afterwards, when confronted by an intergalactic armada made up of millions of starships, Korvac realized that, although he was now stronger than any being in the universe, he was not stronger than every being in the universe. Deciding that he must arm himself, Korvac consumed every life force remaining on Earth, including those of his minions and his allies, all of humanity, the Celestial Fourth Host and the planet's very biosphere. When Carina then offered him her own life as a gift of love, Korvac absorbed her energy but not for love because, as he told her, he was now filled with nothing but hatred for the universe that had refused to yield to his will. Korvac then grew to an immense size as he prepared to confront the armada.[1]\nAt this point,Quasararrived fromEarth-616, having been sent to this timeline by his reality'sUatuto find and retrieve the divergent Living Laser. As the nativeWatchershowed up, Quasar decided that the super-giant standing on Earth and confronting a huge space armada wasn't his business so he quickly located the fleeing Laser on the other side of the giant and quantum-jumped to him. After absorbing the Laser into hisQuantum-Bands, Quasar quantum-jumped back to the interdimensional portal that would take him to his next target.[2]\nAlthough the Watcher tried to convince him not to use the Ultimate Nullifier and to instead create his own galaxy on the other side of the universe, Korvac was so enraged that his dream of universal order was being thwarted and full of hatred for the universe that had robbed him of that dream that he refused to listen. Instead, Korvac concentrated upon the universe in its entirety so that the Ultimate Nullifier could destroy it all. As he became one with the spirit ofEternity, Korvac sensed a growing void in Eternity's breast, a void that wasDeath, Korvac's unbidden ally and unwanted master, who was about to usher Oblivion. With the universe in his mind and death in his heart, Korvac activated the Ultimate Nullifier and destroyed the universe, making all become nothing.[1]Quasar and his captive escaped at the last moment because they used the interdimensional portal just as the nullification effect was beginning to make everything (including the portal) go white.[2]"

Storm, Magneto, Namor, and Hope went to the airship to convince them that Hope did not pose a threat and that with their help she could control the Phoenix Force. Magneto told the other three that Wolverine was there to kill Hope. Tensions rose as the Spider Woman got ready to attack Magneto and he in turned caused metal to seize and hold her.

Nick Fury called for help and a team of Spider-Man, Iceman, Wolverine and Doctor Strange had arrived on the scene. They saved Fury, prevented the use of the Helicarrier's arsenal on civilians and defeated Fin Fang Foom. Even though the heroes saved helicarrier, it was damaged and the team was forced to move to Stark Tower and use it as their headquarters.\nThe next mission was to check the Omega Base and see if anything was wrong there. It was also necessary to check Dr. Bruce Banner, who worked on the Gamma Bomb project. When the team found Dum-Dum Dugan, he was glad Fury understood his message and sent the heroes in. It was also uncovered, that it was M.O.D.O.K. who took over the Omega base. Because of his interference, the base could destroy a dam, that would flood an entire city. On their way to M.O.D.O.K, the heroes rescued Dr. Banner, who was trapped in one cell with the Thing. Ben joined the team after he was freed. When M.O.D.O.K. was defeated, the team was brought back to Stark Tower only to be sent on the next mission.\nNamorita called for help, because Atlanteans got mad and overthrew Prince Namor. Fury answered the call and sent the heroes to Atlantis. A special nanotechnology, invented by Reed Richards and Hank Pym allowed the heroes to breath underwater as long as they needed. When the Namor was freed, he joined the Ultimate Alliance and escorted the Fury's team through his domain. It was uncovered, that it was actually Attuma who used Sonic Emitters to brainwash the people of Atlantis. When the villain was found, he told that it was Masters of Evil who gave him the Emitters to take whatever they wanted from the catacombs. Since Attuma was scared to face the Atlanteans after what he had done, he quickly ran away and didn't fight the heroes. When the heroes entered those catacombs, they found Mandarin, who actually was there to claim the Tome of Asarius. He refused to answer why would he need it and the battle was started. After Mandarin's defeat, the heroes left the Atlantis.\nFury told the heroes, that Jean Grey and Nightcrawler were kidnapped. It was known, that Jean Grey could be found in Murderworld, so the heroes just went there. Jean was found being trapped in a stasis field. After her rescue, she stayed to rest, while the heroes continued their mission. They had a hand-to-hand battle with Arcade, who told everything he knew after he was beaten. Turns out Doom wanted to boost Nightcrawler's powers with the mutant amplifier and use him to travel to different dimensions. With this information in mind, the heroes went straight to Mephisto's Realm, which was confirmed by Doctor Strange as the Nightcrawler's location.\nThe heroes quickly ran through Mephisto's Realm, but his son Blackheart noticed their arrival and warned the father so he could get ready for the fight. However, Mephisto still was defeated and Nightcrawler - rescued. For some reason, he didn't join the team, but they had a new recruit in the face of Miss Marvel, who was also found near Kurt. The reunion was broken by Doctor Strange, who told that Asgard was under attack, so the heroes went back to Stark Tower in order to get ready for the new mission.\nHermod, a messenger of Odin, came to brief the team on the mission details. The Bifrost Bridge was under attack by the Wrecking Crew. The heroes defeated the villains and opened the Bridge. After that Sif told them to free Balder in Asgard. However, Balder could be freed only if Heimdall and Tyr were rescued before. The heroes completed their mission, defeating Skurge the Executioner in the process. During the mission it was uncovered that Loki is responsible for the attack on Asgard. Now the team needed to help Odin to defeat Ymir in Niffleheim. Ymir told the heroes that Loki was about to get the Destroyer Armor and defeat Odin, which would allow him to rule the Asgard. Ultimate Alliance defeated Ymir only to be blown up by Doctor Doom, who arrived on the scene to gloat.\nUatu the Watcher saved the heroes at the last possible moment and teleported them to Attilan - a home of Inhumans located on the Moon. Uatu couldn't stand idle while Doom was misusing Odin's power. To steal Odin's power it was needed to find two items. One of them was the M'kraan Crystal owned by Shi'Ar Empire. It was told, that Black Widow had more information on it. The second item was the Muonic Inducer - the device, used by Galactus to absorb the energy of planets. Galactus was about to attack the planet, populated by Skrulls.\nWhen the heroes arrived on the place where M'kraan Crystal could be found, they were met by Corsair, who told them everything he knew about Deathbird and how she took the throne from her sister Lilandra. The heroes located the villain and defeated her. Angry Deathbird wanted to destroy the ship with a self-destruct command, but Lilandra overrode the controls and saved everyone. After Deathbird flew away, the grateful Lilandra gave a shard of M'kraan Crystal to the heroes.\nOn the Skrull Homeworld heroes encountered their Empress. She promised a secret, which would help to defeat Galactus, if the heroes would clear a path so she could escape. After getting the help, the Empress gloated how well she played her cards and left without telling anything useful. However, the heroes still could beat the Galactus in close combat without any help and make him unconscious long enough for them to take the Muonic Inducer and get away.\nThe heroes were back on Earth only to see that Doom already remade New York and Stark Tower in his own image. Before heading up to Latveria to finally defeat Doom, the Tower's shields should have been activated. After this was done, Doom's Evil Iron Man attacked Fury. When the robot was destroyed, Fury told that Muonic Inducer was already powered up and the team was ready to meet Doom in the last ultimate battle.\nThe heroes indeed confronted Doom in his castle. The power of Muonic Inducer weakened the villain and he was defeated. Then Odin arrived to take Doom with the traitorous Loki back to Asgard where they would learn the true meaning of torture. After that all the destruction caused by Doom was reverted and the team of heroes was to be kept permanently to watch over threats to the world.[1]\nWhile Nintendo DS version of the game was a port of PSP/PS2/Wii version, which isEarth-TRN1407on the wiki, it seemingly used early versions of the game and differs in lots of moments.

She once metClint Barton, and after that she stopped being an assassin and became an agent ofS.H.I.E.L.D.[2]\nWhilst being interrogated byGeorgi Luchkov, Black Widow was called byAgent Coulson, informing her thatHawkeyehad been compromised. After she quickly dispatched of Luchkov and his forces, Coulson informed her she needed to bring inBruce Bannerfor the Avengers Initiative. On the way to Banner's home, Natasha was briefed on the situation, theTesseracthaving been captured byLoki Laufeysonwho was currently mind controlling Hawkeye andDr. Selvig. Approaching Banner whilst flanked byS.H.I.E.L.D.agents, Natasha informed Dr Banner of theTesseract, bringing him onboard to help study it.\nBoarding theHelicarrierwith Dr Banner, Natasha prepared the runway forSteve Rogers' arrival, setting up the runway light, clearing up an oil spillage and finding a signalling flag so the staff could signal the Quinjet's landing. After Rogers' quinjet landed, he joined the duo and made their way inside.\nNatasha flew a Quinjet, carrying Steve to where Loki was located, rendezvousing withIron Man. The two succesfully apprehended Loki and, while Natasha was pilotting the quinjet transporting him, the group was acquainted withThor, Loki's adoptive brother.\nRegrouping on the Helicarrier, Thor informed Natasha of Loki's plan to conquer earth with an army ofChitauri, prompting Natasha to talk to the imprisoned Loki, able to fool him into revealing his plan, mind-controlling the Hulk. Shortly afterwards, Captain America informed Black Widow, Thor, Black Widow, Bruce Banner and Tony Stark of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s plan to build weapons of mass destruction with the Tesseract, this causing Black Widow and Nick Fury to defend S.H.I.E.L.D.'s actions while the others argued with them and each other. The group were then interrupted by the Hellicarrier being attacked by a brainwashedHawkeye, separating the group. Bruce and Natasha were knocked down to the lower levels, with Bruce transforming into the Hulk due to the stress he was already experiencing, the physical pain which kept escalating due to both the landing and a string of accidents and the influence of Loki. Her andAgent Williamswere pursued by Hulk until Thor engaged Hulk physically. Free from Hulk's pursuit, she then went down to the detention level, able to defeat Hawkeye in combat and free him from his mind control in the process. and She later finds herself and battles Clint freeing him from Loki's control.\nDuring the chaos, Loki was able to escape. She was flown to New York by Hawkeye after a briefing from Captain America. Upon arriving at Stark Tower, Black Widow took over piloting duties, fighting the swarm of Chitauri chariots before knocking Loki's chariot out of the sky with a missile. Upon Loki's further fights with Thor, Loki shot the Quinjet out of the sky, forcing them onto the ground. There, the trio found various group of civilians either trapped or vulnerable to Chitauri attacks. Upon rescuing the civilians with their various abilities, the trio were joined by Thor. The quartet continued fighting the Chitauri on the street, hoping to keep their attention on them and away from the civilians, while Iron Man provided air support. After making their way the Park Avenue Viaduct they were joined by Bruce Banner, who transformed into the Hulk and used his strength to stop aLeviathanin its tracks, allowing Iron Man to target its weak spot and destroy it.\nWith theAvengersnow assembled, Captain America took charge, ordering Black Widow to continue fighting Chitauri on the ground in order to keep the ground forces on them. Upon clearing a squad of Chitauri Park Avenue Viaduct, however, Black Widow decided to attempt to close the portal directly, using Captain America's shield to boost her onto a Chitauri chariot, using a plunger to force a Chitauri to follow her directions. Arriving atStark Tower, Hulk was able to retrieve thescepterfor Natasha after she helped him figure out which Loki was real, allowing her to  to close the portal from which the Chitauri were coming from. Upon Stark redirecting a Nuke into the Chitauri mothership, the majority of Chitauri troops died, signalling a successful end to the battle. After a brief scare where Tony had to be woken up by the Hulk, the Avengers were heralded as heroes by the majority of the world, with Loki and the Teseract being returned to Asgard while the Avengers went to get food at Shawarma palace.[2]\nWhenSilver Surfer's Surfboard was destroyed and the pieces were transformed into Cosmic bricks. Natasha and Hawkeye trackedGreen GoblintoOscorp, after working their way through the Times Square wreckage and infiltrating Oscorp with Nat's stealth capabilities, the two rendezvoused withSpider-Man, whereupon they were attacked by Green Goblin. The three pursued Goblin, working their way through the Oscorp labs until Goblin triggered Oscorp's security systems, shutting down various parts of the lab and turning any nearby scientists hostile against the three. After getting through the security lockdown the three engaged Goblin in combat, resulting in Goblin destroying a nearby elevator shaft to hinder their progress.However, at that point Goblin triggered a trap door, sending them down to the lower levels of Oscorp labs. Turning their attention away from Osborn and instead on escaping the lower labs, the three encounteredVenom, who had manage to pervert the lower labs by infesting it with otherSymbiotes, infecting both the environment and the Oscorp Scientists who worked down there. After working their way upwards, the three managed to subdue Venom by exploiting the symbiotes' weakness to sound and fire.  However, the time that was wasted by their encounter with Venom gave Goblin enough time to escape with the Cosmic Brick. Their mission failed, Black Widow and Hawkeye reported back to S.H.I.E.L.D.\nUpon one of Tony's arc reactors, S.H.I.E.L.D. begun tracking its signature, sending Black Widow and Hawkeye to follow the signal.Despite initially inaccurate coordinates, the two were able to find and enter the Hydra base, where they found claw-marks pointing toWolverine's handiwork. Upon going further into the base and encountering Hydra agents, the two met withHuman Torchwho helped them get past a locked door. Fighting numerous Hydra agents along the way, the three made their way to the command room, where they found Loki,Red Skull, andArnim Zolawho were creating a generator based on Tony's arc reactor technology. Spotting the three, Loki blasted them with his staff, knocking Black Widow and Hawkeye unconscious. After Red Skull and Zola were defeated by Human Torch, Captain America, and Wolverine, Black Widow and Hawkeye were taken into a S.H.I.E.L.D. ambulance to tend to their injuries.[4]\nUponMagnetostealing aRoxxonnuclear source, Thing and Captain America were flown to Magneto's location by Black Widow. Upon reaching the island, the two landed, completing Natasha's part of the mission.[4]\nAfter the Cosmic Brick Crisis was resolved and Galactus was defeated, Tony held a party at Stark Tower. Natasha attended the party and, much like the other guests, found it lifeless and boring. After a DJ table was built andNick Furybegan to operate it, Natasha begun to enjoy the party.[4]\nGoing out with Hawkeye to the circus, the two found the potential romantic date ruined byIceman, who unknowingly acted as a Gooseberry to the two. To make matters worse,Nightmarearrived to take over the circus. The trio took to work, withGhost Riderjoining them to help take down Nightmare. The trio fought projections of Nightmare's image whilst constructing ramps for Ghost Rider so he could ram into his true form. Ultimately, Nightmare was defeated and Clint and Natasha were able to continue their date.[4]\nAfter the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., Natasha, along with theAvengers, started tracking downHydrabases across the world, trying to findBaron Wolfgang von StruckerandLoki's Scepter. Finally, they tracked him down toSokovia. Working with Hawkeye to take down one of the towers, the two made their way upwards, where the Hulk helped destroy a nearby bunker that was firing on them. When Hawkeye was injured byQuicksilver, Black Widow took notice and notified the other team members, causing Thor to escort him back to the jet while Iron Man and Captain America completed the mission.\nFresh from victory, the Avengers returned to the newly remodeledAvengers Towerin New York and threw a party to celebrate, Natasha doting over Bruce before the budding couple were supplied with milkshakes. Late in the evening when most of the guests had gone home, the men tested their worthiness trying to lift Mjolnir, but each of them were unsuccessful. The game was interrupted when one of Tony Stark'sIron Legionrobots made a surprise appearance, and after admitting that it was the result of Stark'sUltronprogram mixed with his research into the scepter, it and the reprogrammed legion, attacked the group. Romanoff took cover behind the wet bar with Doctor Banner. Upon Ultron declaring his intentions, the extinction of the Avengers, Thor destroyed his makeshift body withMjolnir, though Ultron's consciousness managed to escape. Worse still, the attack was merely a diversion, as one of the robots made off with the sceptre while the Avengers and their friends were engaged in battle.\nWhen reports of robots attacking sources ofVibraniumbegan surfacing, the Avengers raced to a coastal scrapyard inAfricawhere Stark believed that a substantial quantity of the rare metal might be stored. They arrived shortly after Ultron and its two enhanced allies, twinsWandaandPietro Maximoff. A fight broke out with the Avengers trying to stop Ultron taking Vibranium from the site, and Romanoff found herself incapacitated by Wanda's power to instil nightmare visions. She languished in a scene from her childhood while the fight carried on around her and the enemy made their escape. Still haunted by the ghosts of her past, Romanoff had a welcome respite when Barton took the group to his farm. Nick Fury also arrived at the farm and spoke with the group at length about stopping Ultron.\nAfter Banner made the observation that Ultron was trying to evolve, the remaining Avengers split into two groups with Black Widow joining Captain America and Hawkeye in a bid to stop Ultron from obtaining cellular regeneration technology inSouth Korea. The trio raced for their objective, and found that Ultron's plan to create a new android body for itself were already well underway, but the Avengers' arrival caused it to grab the body and flee. Barton located Ultron escaping in a truck trailer in heavy traffic, and when a window of opportunity presented itself Romanoff dropped to the streets on a motorcycle to pursue it herself. She and Rogers managed to jointly fend off a number of Ultron sentries, and although Romanoff was successful in delivering the dormant android to Barton, she was captured by the robots shortly thereafter.\nWhen she awoke, Romanoff found that she had been transported back to Sokovia, where Ultron made a show of demonstrating his latest upgrade before confining her to a cell. She turned to using old Cold War-era communication techniques in a bid to expose her location without being detected, but could do little else but sit and wait. Barton did indeed receive her signal, and eventually she was treated to the welcome sight of Bruce Banner sneaking in alone to free her while the other Avengers, and their new allies, made a show of confronting Ultron outside. Romanoff forced Banner's transformation, and then they too joined the fight to stop the robot.\nThe Avengers fought hard to break the ranks of Ultron's amassed robot force in the Sokovian city. As the battle wound down, Romanoff and Barton turned their attention to evacuating the civilian populace. Romanoff soon learned that the Hulk had won over Ultron in the departing quintet and appealed to him through a video link to disengage the plane's stealth technology, but the Hulk simply severed the connection.\nAfter Ultron's defeat, the Avengers returned to New York. Romanoff- although mourning Bruce's departure- joining Rogers in welcoming the four new Avengers - Sam Wilson, Col. James Rhodes, Wanda Maximoff, and theVision.[2]\nInChronopolis, Natasha and Clint end up dealing with the huge crime rate in the city, becoming overwhelmed. But thanks to the help of an ally, they can balance the crimes to deal with. Natasha would eventually be taken by a symbiote onSakaar, but she would be freed from the alien's control by the ally. Upon learning that Clint was controlled by a symbiote inAsgard, Natasha goes with her ally there to save Clint. After all the confusion, Natasha says she's going to go back to base and take a shower to clean off the symbiote goo and the sweat that was on her.\nAs the heroes prepare for their final fight againstKang, Natasha can briefly be seen in themansion. She was probably going to take her shower.[1]"

She eventually located a point at which the three Netherworlds converged and which connected the Dark Domain to the rest of Primary Earth. This turned out to be the only place invisible to Dormammu, so Widow set up a Sanctuary there, allowing a degree of safety for civilians who ended up trapped inside the Dark Domain and the sorcerers who sought to oppose Dormammu's influence."

At his first appearance in this reality, Bruce Banner has been the Hulk for some time now. Although mostly seen as a monster, the Hulk did perform several heroic deeds. He even got a video game based on his adventures named \"The Hulk: Gamma Rampage\".\nThis incarnation of the Hulk encountered the young superhero team known asPower Packon several occasions, and fought side by side with them against multiple supervillains. The first time they met in a subway, when the Power Kids were on their way to meet their father,James Powerwhile Bruce Banner was in the same subway train also on his way to Dr. Power, with whom he was working together. The train got attacked byAbsorbing Man. The Hulk and Power Pack were able to beat him.[1]\nThe second time the heroes met was during a demonstration of a new electromagnetic generator, designed by Dr. Power and Banner. During the demonstration, the electrical villainZzzaxwas unleashed (Power Pack had unknowingly brought him with them after a fight with Hydra earlier) and attacked the audience until Power Pack and Hulk successfully defeated him by shorting him out.[2]\nSome time after this, theAbominationescaped from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and wreaked havoc in New York. Hulk got blamed by the media for the rampage. For a brief moment, even Power Pack was tricked into believing Hulk had gone rogue. When Abomination showed up however, the misunderstanding was cleared and the five heroes teamed up against the Abomination, beating him and handing him back to S.H.I.E.L.D.[3]"

In New York City, Spider-Man is fighting Morlun, who deduces that Spider-Man (Ben) is a clone of Peter. Spider-Man continues to fight him, when Morlun, who thinks Peter sent Ben as a decoy, suddenly grabs him by the throat.\nBack in Portland, Peter has completely retired from the vigilante life, and works as a humble electrician. His children are now young adults, and both are aware of his previous life as Spider-Man and Ben’s clone status. On the same day, Peter is chopping wood in the back and talks to Claire about doing grad school at Stanford where she has a scholarship. Claire tells him she does not want to go, leading him to protest that her academic potential can go to waste just like his heroism did, especially in the wake of the Civil War. Before their conversation can escalate, Benjy comes out to inform them of the battle. It is revealed that Ben was killed by Morlun, and the world now thinks that Peter is not only Spider-Man, but also dead.\nPeter recounts to his family that he was visited by Ezekiel, who warned him about Morlun coming to feed on him. MJ suggests they flee, but Peter refuses to let them come with him since he is the only notable Spider-Totem among them, and prepares to leave the country by himself.\nAs he is packing, he thinks about how Ben had no one in New York even though he had everything in the fear it would be taken from him. Claire confronts him again, telling him that he needs to go back to New York as Spider-Man. Peter refuses due to having been retired for so long, but Claire reveals that she knows he never really did. It is revealed that Peter was in New York on 9/11 for J. Jonah Jameson’s funeral, and when the towers collapsed, he put on Ben’s Scarlet Spider mask and began helping with the cleanup; Claire briefly spotted him on the news and immediately knew who it was, then deduced that he had done it before, otherwise he wouldn’t have the mask. Claire then tells Peter that he always reacted to people in danger as Spider-Man rather than directly going after a threat, which is why he secluded the family. She then encourages him to be different for the sake of his superhero friends he left behind, and actively take on the threat.\nOne week later in Washington, DC, Tony begins receiving bad press from people who think he only created the act as a means of undermining Peter. He learns from his assistant that his side recently won a battle against Captain America’s forces and captured Daredevil, but are struggling with Matt Murdock’s past career as a civil rights activist. Just then, another assistant arrives and reveals a story about Peter.\nIt is shown that Peter took Claire’s advice and traveled to New York, where he plans to publicly reveal everything via the Daily Bugle. Peter talks with Betty, now in charge of the Bugle, about the story. She warns him that not everyone will buy it, and that he can’t go back on his plan to catch Morlun. Peter thinks on her words as he comes to Parker Industries, only to find Tony waiting for him. Tony tells Peter he has a deal for him. He explains by saying that the war has left everyone weary, with old heroes prolonging the conflict while new ones fall in line. He also says that, since his powers could have affected normal life, he has effectively broken the law for not registering and could have his assets seized. His deal, therefore, is to grant Peter and his family amnesty in exchange for becoming a U.S.Avenger and assisting him in creating a structure for the act. Peter refuses, leading the U.S.Avengers - Iron Man, War Machine, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, She-Hulk, and Iron Fist - to attack him.\nBack in Portland, Mary Jane keeps watching the news. Claire and Benjy talk about Peter’s chances of success, when suddenly the house is attacked by Morlun. The family tries to flee in their car, but find Morlun destroyed it. Thinking Peter ran away, Morlun decides to have Claire and Benjy instead, leading them to attack him.\nPeter attempts to escape the U.S.Avengers, but they quickly knock him down. Before they can arrest him, however, Cap and his Avengers - Cloak, Dagger, Hawkeye, and Luke Cage - come to rescue him. As another battle rages, Peter flees and breaks into Ben’s storage room where he kept his Spider-Man suits.\nMorlun takes Claire and begins absorbing her, but she scratches his face, allowing the Parker family to flee into the woods. As they try to think of a plan, they notice Claire drew blood from Morlun by scratching him. Benjy thus deduces that Morlun is vulnerable when he is feeding, removing his indestructibility. He charges Morlun, and intentionally allows Morlun to feed on him. While Morlun monologues, an enraged Claire takes a log and smashes Morlun with it; he is impaled on a tree and dies, but Benjy appears to also have succumbed to being fed on.\nMeanwhile, Spider-Man rejoins the fight between the Avengers, where he reveals that Iron Man had fail-safes in each of his teammates’ suits should they turn on him. Spider-Man promptly short-circuits the suits, knocking out all of the U.S.Avengers except Iron Man, and rips Tony’s mask off. Tony retorts Peter, saying that they can’t comprehend the human suffering that non-powered individuals face because they see metahumans such as themselves as gods, and that the act is meant to protect those people. Spider-Man replies that Tony in particular can’t be trusted, but Tony - who is revealed to be a hologram - says that he is smarter than all of them and knows what the world is really facing. He makes one final plea for them to join his cause before departing.\nAmadeus Cho informs the Avengers that Tony is sending reinforcements, so the team decides to flee to base via Cloak. Before he does so, Spider-Man apologizes to Cap for fleeing New York, saying that he wanted to be with his family. Seeing that Claire and Benjy are powered, Cap does not hold this against Spider-Man, but says that Tony will come for them and that it would subsequently be better if he joined the war. Spider-Man decides to join, with Cap promising to take care of Morlun together with him. But just as they depart, Spider-Man muses how they are both old now, and have to make the world a better place before they die.\nTHE REAL-TIME LIFE STORY OF SPIDER-MAN CONTINUES!"

In the 13 years since the death of Ben, the Civil War ended in a stalemate, and humanity ended up becoming tired of heroes. This led them to sell their souls to the Devil, granting power to Doctor Doom, who then proceeded to conquer the entire world. Many of the older heroes - Tony, Cap, Reed, and Jessica - as well as all of Peter’s enemies have since died or gone missing as a result of Doom, leaving Peter (whose true whereabouts were eventually exposed to the world) the last remaining hero of his generation, and subsequently the leader of the resistance against Doom. Despite this, he views the current generation as far better than his because of their comparative lack of emotional hang-ups, and his priority now is to guide them in the right path.\nIn the final stage of the resistance, Peter - accompanied by his apprentice, Miles Morales, who became Spider-Man prior to Peter’s reintroduction to the world - now plans to fly to a base orbiting Earth, which they hope to use as a doomsday device to dismantle all of Doom’s armada, they destroy the base to prevent reversal of the process, after which the Resistance can mop the floor with Doom. Peter says his goodbyes to MJ, as well as Benjy (who walks with a cane but is otherwise alive and a tech wizard) and Claire (who has become a superhero herself). Peter and Miles then hop into a Doom spaceship and fly towards the base.\nPeter and Miles arrive at the base and begin venturing through it, where Peter notices that Miles is taking the situation too seriously. As they are working with the system, the power suddenly shuts down. As Miles tries to reconfigure the system, Peter goes to see what has happened, and discovers that their ship has been destroyed by a stowaway. The stowaway attacks Peter and reveals itself to be Venom, who has bonded with Kraven. Kraven attacks Peter and destroys his mask when Miles comes in to save him. Though Kraven also destroys Miles’ mask, Peter uses a sound device in his suit to disrupt the symbiote again, shattering it. Underneath, Kraven is revealed to have actually gone through with killing himself, with his skeleton being the true thing controlled by the symbiote.\nPeter and Miles are regaining their bearings when Peter reveals that he knows a truth: Miles’ seriousness, as well as his Venom’s reaction to him and certain other clues, is the result of the fact that Miles isn’t really Miles. Instead, Otto Octavius has taken control of his mind. Exposed, Otto attacks Spider-Man and slams him against a wall. Otto reveals to Spider-Man that his intention for years was to swap minds with Peter to achieve a longer life, but because Peter also has aged he decided to settle for Miles. Otto also reveals that Doom gave him the means to do so as part of his grand alliance and a spy against Peter, but Otto is planning to turn on him by becoming a hero, the Superior Spider-Man. He then connects heads with Spider-Man, and they proceed to enter the space in Spider-Man’s mind.\nWithin the mind, Otto declares that he wishes to destroy Peter’s consciousness, and calls upon imaginative members of the Sinister Six - Venom, Rhino, Green Goblin, Vulture, and Electro - to do so. In response, Peter creates versions of his past self from each of the previous decades, and they dispatch them easily. Otto, alone again, tries to transform into a larger version of his younger self when Peter whips out a trump card: Aunt May. May reaches out to Otto by telling him she loves him and mentions how he could never accept his own limitations. She encourages him to give Miles his body back and be a hero in what little is left of his life. As Otto leaves Peter’s mind, Peter also talks to May and asks him if Otto wanted closure, what does he want. May responds by saying that what he wants most is to save Uncle Ben, but he can’t, so instead he saves everyone else. And she encourages him, in his own final act, to do the same for the entire planet.\nSpider-Man wakes up from and zips back into the base carrying an unconscious Otto. Otto had already deployed the Doomsday Pulse, but Venom’s interference has resulted in the base slowly destroying itself. He rushes Otto over to an escape pod and placed him inside; Otto protests, but Spider-Man refuses to let him stay as he would inevitably take Miles down with him. Once Otto has been sent down to Earth, Spider-Man begins patching up the base, keeping it from exploding. In the end, he is unable to do one single hole, but the Venom symbiote, in one final act of connection, covers the hole up, as both of them realize they are going to die.\nIn his final moments, Peter enters the space in his mind again to talk to MJ, back when they were still young. He asks her if everything will be all right with Otto, Miles, and their children, and she ensures him they will. MJ, however, does question how reliable she herself is due to her merely being a figment of Peter’s imagination, but Peter tells her that after a lifetime with her, he knows her better than himself. His final words are “You’re my heart, Mary Jane Watson... You’re my jackpot”. With this, the Doomsday Pulse activates and the base explodes, killing the symbiote and Peter Parker at once.\nIn the aftermath, Otto gives Miles his body back, and Doom’s army is destroyed by the new generation of heroes. After Peter’s funeral, Miles goes to visit Otto, who has returned to his decrepit body. Otto apologizes to Miles, telling him he never wanted Peter to die, but Miles brushes him off. As he leaves, he tells Otto he contemplated killing him, but knows Peter wouldn’t want that.\nLater, Miles meets with MJ. He confides in her that he has become disgusted with himself and his heroic work, knowing that Otto was in him for such a long period of time and wondering what damage he did to him; he can’t even wear his Spider-Man costume anymore. In response, MJ tells him that maybe what he really needs is to start over. She then gives Miles Peter’s original Spider-Man suit, and encourages him to take Peter’s place, which he accepts.\nLastly, in the afterlife, Peter thinks about a dream he kept having. In it, he is letting Uncle Ben’s killer go again, only to stop him with webshooters. And Peter has come to know what that dream means: No matter what happened since that moment, for the first time ever, he would do it all over again.\n\nThe End\nTHE REAL-TIME LIFE STORY OF SPIDER-MAN CONCLUDES!"

After hisUncle Benwas murdered, Peter finally understood Ben's teachings that with great power, there must also come great responsibility. With this, He became the crime fighting superhero known asSpider-Man.[1]\nAt age 19 Peter prepared for an internship at theBaxter BuildingwithReed Richards. He was successful and for a decade collaborated with Reed and laterOtto Octaviusat theFuture Foundation.[2]\nAfter the death of his wifeGwen Stacy, Peter fell in love with and marriedMary Jane Watson. The two had two twin children,ClaireandBenjamin, while Peter was participating in the Secret Wars. Returning to New York in ablack symbiote suit, Peter was attacked and buried byKraven the Hunter, who sought to replace him as New York's protector. The symbiote helped Peter to dig himself out of his grave and also drove him to a blinding rage that might have led Peter to murdering Kraven, had it not been for the intervention of Mary Jane. She fired a sonic gun upon Peter, separating him from the symbiote, but the trauma of the event drove MJ to leave Peter and raise their children across the country in Portland.[3]\nBy 1995, Peter was living an unexciting life, finding no joy in either being Spider-Man or as CEO of Parker Industries. Still separated from Mary Jane, Peter had began an affair with private investigatorJessica Jones, who Peter had hired to report the whereabouts of the recently-released Norman Osborn. Peter would be abducted byOtto Octavius, who sought to analyze both Peter and his cloneBenso as to reverse-engineer Miles Warren's cloning experiments and possibly cheat his own death. Otto's revelation that Peter was actually the clone and Ben the original sent Ben into a blind fury, attacking Otto. Peter attempted to restrain Ben, but as he did Otto lunged one of his mechanical arms at the two. Ben's spider-sense allowed him to leap out of the way, but Harry Osborn jumped in front of Peter to save him. In the aftermath, Peter gave Ben his life and company, content to travel to Portland and try to live out a quiet life with his family. Before doing so however, Peter confronted Osborn, living in a garage in New Jersey, and revealed he was aware of Osborn's manipulations to the data Otto read and that Peter was the original the whole time. Osborn attacked Peter when told of Harry's death, but the elderly man suffered a heart attack in his fluster, bitterly cursing Peter with his final breath.[3]\nSpider-Man circa 2006\nPeter returned to New York to attend the funeral of J. Jonah Jameson in September 2001. During this time the terrorist attacks on September 11 occurred, and Peter, his identity hidden by Ben's 'Red Mask' mask, did his best to help. Five years later, Ben was killed by the vampiricMorlun, indirectly revealing Peter as Spider-Man to the world. While initially planning to flee across the world to draw Morlun away from his family, his daughter Claire convinced Peter to go to New York, where he would tell his story to the Daily Bugle.Tony Stark, now U.S. Secretary of Defense, approached Peter on the steps of Parker Industries and \"offered\" him to sign up for the Superhuman Registration Act, subtly threatening to seize the company should he not comply. Tony'sU.S.Avengerspromptly attacked Peter when he rebuked Tony, but the timely intervention ofCaptain America's own team ofAvengersallowed Peter the opportunity to sneak into the building and equip himself in a Spider-Man suit. Peter disarmed the U.S.Avengers by activating a fail-safe to their armored suits, correctly guessing that Tony installed one out of his mistrust of others. Peter once again shot down Tony and his claims of interest in national security, but \"Tony\" revealed himself to merely be a sophisticated hologram and made it clear he would not cease until Peter and all superhumans are either registered or arrested. Peter fled the scene along with the rest of Cap's Avengers.[4]"

Iron Man was supposedly among the heroes who went to the U.S.S.R. in response to the destruction ofAllentown,Pennsylvania, which would be referred to as the Russian War. The United States ultimately won the war, and over the course of the next decade Stark would supposedly help \"various regimes around the world\" with the excess of weapons flooding the market.[3]\nBy 1995, Stark Industries had expanded into Stark International, with one of its new developments in communications. Tony met withParker IndustriesCEOPeter Parkerthat year to discuss a merger, but when Parker insisted Tony cease making weapons before they made a deal, Tony berated Peter, implying he cared not for his family's safety, all while bolstering his personal efforts in ending the Russian War.[4]\nTony exploited the cultural climate following the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, becoming Secretary of Defense and imposing theSuperhuman Registration Act. As Iron Man, Tony led a government-approved team of armored heroes dubbed theU.S.Avengers, which were staunchly opposed by Captain America's own team ofAvengers. In 2006, when the Daily Bugle revealed that the recent death of Spider-Man was merely aclone, Tony confronted the real Peter on the steps of Parker Industries, \"offering\" Peter a chance to register while also subtly threatening to seize Parker Industries (as the company would \"have been unfairly acquired through powers\") should Peter refuse to comply. The U.S.Avengers promptly attacked Peter when he rebuked Tony's offer, but the timely intervention of Cap's Avengers provided Peter the opportunity to sneak into Parker Industries and dress into a Spider-Man suit. Peter successfully disabled Iron Man and the entire U.S.Avengers team by activating a remote fail-safe, correctly guessing that Tony would have installed one in the first place due to his constant distrust in others. \"Tony\" revealed himself to merely be a sophisticated hologram controlled elsewhere, but before dissipating, Tony berated both the Captain and Peter for their \"schoolyard sense of right and wrong\" and made it clear he would not cease until Peter and all superhumans are either registered or arrested.[5]"

As it was, Allied intelligence learned that much of the plan, but no more information on what it meant. That includedCaptain Americahimself, although he had a list of the agents involved, although he realized some time after his revival from suspended animation of its relevance and traveled to Germany to stop them.\nThe advanced designs for the Nazi Sleepers were based on theThule society's efforts to recreate theSerpent's version of theAsgardian Destroyer.[1]This one was awakened as the Final Sleeper.[2][3]\nThe first known Trio of Sleepers were each assigned an agent who had the task of awakening one of the robots that would combine to form a new super-robot.[4]Despite Captain America's efforts to stop them, the first Sleeper was awakened byMartinus Von Kimmer, the second Sleeper byErica Wolfmann, and the third Sleeper by a Nazi agent namedSchlag. Captain America attempted to stop the first two on his own, then realized he needed reinforcements and alerted a nearby NATO base as to the emergency.\nUnfortunately, the task force was unable to stop the robots from joining with the third Sleeper. The three robots were designed to fuse into one giant robot and then take course north, presumably to the North Pole where Captain America surmised that it was going to burrow deep into the Earth there and destroy the world in a cataclysmic explosion. Whether or not that was going to be the actual function of the robots, Cap was determined to prevent it. The Sleepers were defeated when Cap sabotaged the fused robot, parachuting onto the flying robot and detonating it over the Atlantic.[5]\nA fourth Sleeper, a living Volcano, was awakened by the Red Skull using a soni-crystal delivered to him by a Nazi agent named Von Krimm.[6]It disintegrated and was presumably destroyed whenAgent 13's feelings for Captain America caused the soni-crystal to shatter.[7]\nA fifth Sleeper was also activated by the Red Skull. This Sleeper was more of a vehicle than a robot, and was piloted by the Skull and a group ofHydraagents. TheKingpin's mob distracted it with tanks, while Captain America and theFalconsnuck aboard and destroyed it from within.[8]\nIn an attempt to cause chaos preceding theCivil War, the Red Skull smuggled parts of a gigantic Sleeper into London, and set it on a path of wanton destruction. The robot was stopped by Captain America, theWinter Soldier,Spitfire,Union Jack, and Agent 13. The Red Skull used the battle as a means to promote the United States' passage of theSuperhuman Registration Act.[9]\nVarious, originally the Forth Sleeper could alter its density from its natural tempered steel form to total intangibility. The circuits that controlled this function have burned out and have not been replaced. The Sleeper originally could also generate \"volcanic\" thermal energy and project it through its face-place. This function has also apparently been eradicated.\nProgrammed to be moderately proficient at hand-to-hand combat\nSuperhuman Class 10\nThe vibration of a certain \"sonic crystal\" caused the Sleeper's intangibility control to malfunction\nRepulsor-ray blasters mounted in eye sockets"

Walking back to their headquarters they find that the place looks oddly different, yet familiar and set with defenses that they had changed years ago. Entering the briefing room they come face to face with the original Avengers: Iron Man, Thor, Giant-Man, Wasp, and the Hulk. Although both parties are confused a battle erupts  when Goliath tries to unmask Giant-Man and is shocked to find it isn't an impostor -- it's really him. The original Avengers manage to force the \"new\" members into retreat, and they seek refuge in a nearby subway tunnel to try and figure out what's going on. They deduce that perhaps their accidental tampering of history during World War II had caused a time paradox that has caused their current predicament.\nMeanwhile, the original Avengers are paid a visit by the Scarlet Centurion, apparently somebody whom they owe a great debt too. The Centurion informs the Avengers that the five super powered beings that had shown up were the ones he said were the evil beings he foretold would come one day. He instructs the original Avengers to stay at Avengers Mansion to await further orders.\nBack in the subway tunnel, Goliath considers the possibility that a device called a Herodotron might still exist. In their own timeline, Goliath helped construct this device, which would record all historical data. Figuring they have nothing to lose in checking, they go to the building on Long Island which housed the Herodotron in their own time. They break into the facility and find that it does indeed exist in this alternate reality. They decide to wire Captain America into the device because he has the will power to handle all the incoming information.\nSearching through the recorded history, Captain America finds the truth: Back during the early days of the Avengers, following their battle with the Space Phantom (Back inAvengers#2) before the Hulk could leave the group they are visited by the Scarlet Centurion. The Centurion offers them knowledge of the future so that the group may conquer famine, plague, and pestilence from the world and bring on a golden era of peace. The Avengers decide to hear out the Centurion who tells them that the world's problems are the result of so many super-powered beings running loose.\nThe Avengers then go on a mission to capture all the super-beings, starting with the Fantastic Four, then Spider-Man, the X-Men, Sub-Mariner, Dr. Strange. They prevent SHIELD from ever forming by capturing its founding members, and defeat Daredevil. With all the world's heroes captured, the Avengers then take down every super-villain in the world. Not even the combined efforts of Dr. Doom, Electro, the Mandarin, and Dr. Octopus can stop the Avengers. After all the super-powered beings on Earth were defeated by the Avengers, they then declare control of the world and order the stop of all atomic tests and scientific inquiry in an attempt to halt the advent of new super-beings.\nStopping the history playback, Cap informs his fellow Avengers that their counterparts in this new timeline have turned the world into a dictatorship under their complete control. The group decides that the only way they can stop this reality's Avengers is by correcting the divergence they made in time. They decide the best thing to do is to recollect Dr. Doom's time machine, which they learn has been disassembled and all its parts have been spread out around the city. The Avengers split into groups to find each part.\nHawkeye and Black Panther travel to the construction site of a new office building to locate the first piece of the time machine. There they get into a battle with the Hulk and Iron Man. Hawkeye easily defeats Iron Man with acid arrows (in this reality, there was no Hawkeye for Iron Man to battle and come up with defenses to Hawkeye's arrows) and while Black Panther has the Hulk distracted, somehow one of Hawkeye's sonic arrows causes the Hulk to change back into Bruce Banner. Hawkeye and Black Panther recover the first part of Doom's time machine.\nNext Captain America battles Thor by himself. Cap ends up defeating Thor by separating him from his hammer longer than 60 seconds and knocking out Thor's mortal guise of Donald Blake. Cap secures his part of Doom's time machine.\nGoliath and Wasp square off against their own original Avengers counterparts at the docks. Goliath defeats Giant-Man underwater due to Goliath's stronger lung capacity, and the Wasp uses her counterpart's anger against her. With their opponents defeated, Goliath and Wasp capture the final piece of Doom's time machine.\nThe Avengers bring Doom's time machine and their opponents back to Doom's stateside castle in order to repair the device and return history back to normal. In reassembling the time machine the Scarlet Centurion appears and reveals that the whole ordeal, beginning with implanting the idea that Bucky may have lived in Cap's mind, was orchestrated by the Centurion to take over this era. His reasoning was that if he pitted the time-displaced Avengers against a version of the original team that had never met any of them, he'd be able to swiftly dispose of the Avengers for good.\nWhile the other Avengers distract the Centurion, Goliath shrinks down to Ant-Man size and activates the time machine, sending the Centurion into the far future, and the Avengers back to their own version of history.\nThe Watcher appears and explains to the leader that the Scarlet Centurion was formerly known as the time traveler Rama Tut, and after his meeting with Dr. Doom became the Centurion. Having defeated the Centurion, the Avengers sent him to the year 4000 where he would become Kang the Conqueror.\nThe Avengers rematerialize in Doom's castle in their own era, with no memory of the events that transpired. When Jan mentions she dozed off at the controls while the Avengers were back in time during World War 2, the group dismisses it and returns home.\nFeatured Characters:\nVehicles:\nA double page pin-up, featuring every character who had ever been an Avenger up to this point:Thor,Iron Man,Goliath,Wasp,Hulk,Captain America,Scarlet Witch,Quicksilver,Hercules,HawkeyeandBlack Panther. Apparently, the creators had forgotten thatSwordsmanhad also been a member, if only briefly.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nVehicles:\nA humorous look at the Bullpen creators of the Avengers series, making fun of each of them and drawing them in a comedic way."

He then created countlessOcktoidsthat formed a new set of tentacles which connected to his amygdala and beared more resemblance to octopus tentacles.[2]\nOcktoidsforming a new set of Doctor Octopus' Tentacles.\nThe old set discarded went for help toJ. Jonah Jamesonand Spider-Man who rebuild it and in gratitude they helped the hero in battling their previous owner.[3]\n\n\"Doctor Octopus\"\nTentacles: Doctor Octopus' superhuman abilities derive from the four mentally controlled, electronically powered, telescoping, prehensile titanium-steel tentacles attached to a stainless-steel harness encircling his body from lower chest to waist. Each tentacle, approximately five inches in diameter, terminates in three single-jointed pincers. The pincers are able to rotate in relation to the arm for 360 degrees, in a screwdriver-like twisting motion. Each tentacle segment contains four high-efficiency electric motors equipped with a clutched, helical-gear train, independently mounted on frictionless gimbals and housed in four thin, overlapping layers of titanium-niobium steel.\nThe titanium-steel alloy is light, has high-tensile strength, a high melting point, and high thin-wall rigidity. The motors get their power from a small nuclear-powered thermo-electric generator, which can provide several hundred watts per hour for up to five years before needing to replace its U-239 core. The tentacles have been modified since the time of the original accident to include high-efficiency battery packs (enabling movement when cut off from the central power source) and individual micro-circuit control modules (enabling each arm to perform certain pre-programmed actions when Octopus loses conscious control). In the event that Octopus loses consciousness, the control module of each arm has enough pre-programmed conditional responses in its memory chip to enable it to perform a relatively complex sequence of actions, such as saving his life. The trauma of his arm or arms being separated from the harness causes a period of disorientation in which his arms flail about uncontrollably until the pre-programming takes over.\nSpider-Man using his Spider-Arms in combat.\nAs a possible homage to his life as Doctor Octopus, Otto added \"Spider-Arms\" toSuperior Spider-Man's Suit,[5]as well as theIron Spider Armor.[5]\n\n\n"

The most she had managed to control were moths, but she was simply using tricks with ultraviolet light. Melissa's mother went through a similar path, which caused Melissa to become embarrassed of their failures.[2]She went to college at theEmpire State University, and eventually became a world-renowned entrepreneur,[3]having created her own successful engineering firm.\nMorbeck became fixated on her family's failed goal after learning ofSquirrel Girl, a young adventurer with the ability to naturally communicate with squirrels, and set out to achieve her grandmother's dream now knowing it was possible. To this end, Melissa created a microchip which, once implanted subcutaneously in an animal, it allowed it to receive instructions from Melissa directly,[2]with secondary CPUs increasing its intelligence to understand those instructions.[4]\nThese devices made their way to thousands of animals after Melissa began to sell them as tracking microchips at unprofitably low costs to vets, zoos, circuses, parks, and reserves. Morbeck soon amassed an inconspicuous army of spies under her total control, with which she manipulated events and eliminated inconveniences, no matter how insignificant they were.[4]Driven by her personal philosophy that the great responsibility entailed by a great power was defined as having control over people, Morbeck set her sights on world-conquering.[4]\nHowever, Morbeck became worried her plans would eventually become compromised by the Squirrel Girl and other two animal-talking heroes she had learned of,Chipmunk HunkandKoi Boi. In order to keep an eye on these three wild cards, Morbeck pulled the strings of their lives to ensure they'd end up in the same computer science program at ESU in the same year, and were assigned in the same room.[2]\nMorbeck subsequently approached Squirrel Girl's alter-ego, that of Doreen Green, under the pretense of being a noble mentor and offered to bankroll her, demonstrating her supposedly natural abilities of communication with animals in the process. Doreen accepted Morbeck's offer, outfitting herself with a jetpack and gliding wings to help her crime-fighting escapades. Unbeknown to Squirrel Girl, Morbeck intended to induce dependency on the young heroine in order to manipulate her into becoming her protégée,[3]thus neutralizing her as a threat.\nWhen Squirrel Girl arranged a second meeting with Melissa to get flying suits for Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boi, Doreen's friendNancy Whiteheadconfronted Melissa, having grown suspicious of her, entrapping Morbeck and having her reveal her true nature. Melissa tried to lock up Doreen and Nancy at her house, but they escaped through a window and attempted to retaliate with an army of squirrels. Controlling an army of rats, Morbeck threatened to release them to the squirrels if Doreen didn't accept to peacefully talk. Doreen accepted after a failed attempt at escape, during which Melissa disabled her jetpack and wings.\nWhile Nancy ran away to alert the authorities, Melissa revealed to Squirrel Girl the true nature of her ability to talk to animals, while using said powers to take control of thousands of creatures, including those of the Central Park Zoo, in order to assemble an army of animals to prevent access to her mansion for authorities.[4]After expressing her disappointment with Doreen for not living up to her expectations, namely not ending up following the same philosophy as her, Melissa revealed she had managed to usePym Particlesto miniaturize theMark VI, the room-sized super-computer she used to communicate with her subjects exclusively from her mansion, making her animal control technology much more practical. Melissa subsequently teleported away once the police and Squirrel Girl's allies had broke through her defenses, revealing she had plans forNew York City.\nSeveral weeks later, Morbeck stroke back, sending a message under the pretense she was Doctor Doom threatening to release an army of mosquitos carrying diseases on the city.[2]Morbeck then had a bear dressed as Doctor Doom confronts Squirrel Girl, releasing him from her control and having it take off the armor soon afterward as part of a plan to pin the pretense on Squirrel Girl. Morbeck then confronted Doreen and her allies with her army of animals, which she pretended had been freed from Squirrel Girl's control with Melissa's technology. Fortunately,Tippy-Toemanaged to get close enough to Melissa to set off a micro-EMP hastily built by Nancy, effectively freeing Melissa's army from her grasp. Melissa tried to keep pushing for the angle that Squirrel Girl was the villain. But support from the superhero community cleared Squirrel Girl's name, and Melissa was arrested. Morbeck's mind-control tags were disabled from her animals, which were eventually returned to the zoo or the wild. While in prison, Melissa was visited byRatatoskr.[5]\nAs Iron Ring"

The prodigal CEO ofStark Industries, Stark was kidnapped by theTen RingsinAfghanistan, where he crafted an armor to escape his captors. Returning to the states, Stark upgraded the crude suit into a sleek, advanced armor. After defeating the orchestrator of his kidnapping, his business partnerObadiah Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man, and set out to help the world. Working as a consultant forS.H.I.E.L.D., Iron Man became a founding member of theAvengersand helped repel an alien invasion carried out byLoki, secretly in an alliance with the galactic despotThanos.\nLoki's invasion opened Tony's eyes to Earth's fragile place in a dangerous universe teeming with alien threats. This dread of imminent global perils was explointed by the hexingWanda Maximoff, who pushed Stark into building a peacekeeping A.I. calledUltronwith the help ofBruce Banner. Ultron went rogue and attempted to extinguish humanity before being defeated by the Avengers. The guilt of creating Ultron convinced Tony to support theSokovia Accordsto regulate superhuman activity, which splintered the Avengers and brought Iron Man's side in opposition againstCaptain Americawhen he began protecting the fugitiveWinter Soldier. Reeling from the fallout, Iron Man began mentoring the burgeoning super heroSpider-Man.\nWhen Thanos and theBlack Orderinvaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the sixInfinity Stones, Iron Man,Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man convened to battle him onTitanwith the help of theGuardians of the Galaxy. They failed, and Thanos ultimately used the Infinity Stones to eradicate half of all life in the universe, although Stark survived. Five years later, Stark had retired from the super hero life, settling down withPepper Pottsand having a daughter,Morgan. After devising a method tosafely travel through time and space, Stark rejoined the Avengers in their mission to retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past to resurrect those killed by Thanos. Their mission was a success, but the Avengers were inadvertently followed into the present bya past versionof the Mad Titan. The combined might of Earth's Mightiest Heroes managed stave off Thanos and his army until Stark saw no choice but to wield the Infinity Stones himself to eliminate the invaders, sacrificing his life in the process. Saving the universe from decimation, Iron Man left behind a legacy as Earth's most revered super hero.\nBorn on May 29, 1970[9][11]to legendary innovator, Manhattan Project engineer and weapons developerHoward Starkand socialiteMaria Stark, Tony Stark's early life was often dominated by the absence of his father whom he would later describe as 'cold' and 'calculating'.[12]\nHowever from an early age he quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four he built his first circuit board, at age six his first engine, and at seventeen he graduatedsumma cum laudefromM.I.T..\nWhen his parents were killed in a car accident, Howard Stark's lifelong friend and ally,Obadiah Stane, stepped in to fill the gap left by the legendary founder. At age twenty-one, Tony became the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company after the inheritance ofStark Industries, a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military.[3]\nWith the keys to the business empire, he ushered in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, and satellite targeting. Stark Industries did pioneering work in medical technology and in combating world hunger with their Intelli-Crops program. Tony's influence changed the face of the weapons industry by \"ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe.\"\nAlthough he developed a strong reputation in his field, Tony rarely seemed interested in the work of others; during a party inBern,Switzerland, to celebrate the millennium, he briefly conversed with scientistAldrich Killianand then completely forgot about the man after promising to meet him on the roof in favor of spending time with scientistMaya Hansen, offering some brief observations on her work and then leaving the morning after.[7]\nStark's First Armor, Mark I\nWhen Stark traveled to Kabul,Afghanistanin May of 2008 to introduce his new cluster missile design, an extremely destructive, multi-warhead weapon called the \"Jericho\", to theUnited States Air Force, his convoy was attacked by militant accomplices of terrorist-leaderRazaand he was knocked unconscious. He woke up to find that he had been severely injured by shrapnel piercing his chest, and had been captured by the militants, yet had survived thanks to his fellow captive,Dr. Ho Yinsen.\nYinsen had made a high powered electromagnet to hold the shrapnel in place, preventing it from puncturing his heart and thus keeping him alive. Stark was ordered by their captors, a terrorist group calling themselves theTen Rings, to build them a new version of the Stark Industries' Jericho missile. He grudgingly agreed, but instead used the time to build apowered suit of armoralong with a miniatureArc Reactorto keep him alive.\nDuring his escape, Yinsen was killed in an attempt to stall the guards long enough to buy Stark enough time to charge the suit. After the suit was powered up he broke out and destroyed all stock they had of Stark weapons, and used a rocket booster to get clear of the scene. After crashing into the sand he abandoned his armor, and traveled for some time before U.S. military helicopters found him and carried him to safety.[3]\nIron Man Armor MK III\nUpon returning to theUnited Statesin late August, Stark declared that Stark Industries would no longer manufacture weapons, a move which his business partner Obadiah Stane told him was quickly blocked by the board members. He decided to recreate his armor suit with a vastly upgraded design featuring flight capability, and built a more powerful and reliable arc reactor, both to power his pacemaker and the suit. This experimental test model gave way to a more refined third generation suit, heavily armed, and painted in a vivid red and gold theme that would become his trademark through many more successive generations of his armor.\nFaced with the realization that his weapons designs had fallen into the wrong hands, Stark donned the MK III suit and flew to Afghanistan to stop the Ten Rings. He stopped the group and destroyed their Stark weapon stock, while accidentally drawing the attention of the United States Air Force and his friendLt. Colonel James Rhodes. They sent two F-22 jets after Stark to shoot him down, but Stark managed to escape them, and Rhodes covered up the incident after he found out that Stark was piloting the armor, stating that the altercation was a training exercise.\nWhile he was working on improving the suit he discovered that Stane had been dealing under the table to both sides in the conflict. He sent his assistantVirginia \"Pepper\" Pottsto hack into the Stark mainframe. While he was back at home Stane stunned him with a device that induced temporary paralysis, and then stole the arc reactor from Stark's chest. Stark went back to his lab after the paralyzing device wore off and tried to get the old reactor before he went into cardiac arrest. With the help of his personal A.I. computer,J.A.R.V.I.S., he was able to put the arc-reactor in his chest.\nStark and Stane in combat\nUsing his first reactor, which was not designed to power his latest armor, Stark suited up once more and went to confront Stane. He battled with Stane atop Stark Industries and the surrounding streets, defeating him when the full-sized arc reactor that powered the lab was deliberately overloaded, under Stark's instruction, by Potts. Stark's reactor reactivated after having almost failed completely from the blast.\nAfterwards, Stark's alter ego was dubbed \"Iron Man\" by the press. Stark held a press conference where his government contacts expected him to state that Iron Man was Stark's own bodyguard. However, after stumbling into a loaded question by one of the press reps, he ultimately made his identity as Iron Man public instead.[3]\nLater that night, Stark came home and was greeted byNick Fury, leader ofS.H.I.E.L.D.(the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division), who told him about a plan called theAvenger Initiative.[3]\nOver the next six months, Stark would realize his design of the reactor in his chest required a heavy element such as palladium to keep it running. Unfortunately, palladium was continuously eroded by the neutron bombardment, and released deadly poisons into Tony's body. As he came to the realization that his demise was at hand, he began giving his things away to his trusted friends and worthy organizations, such as a piece of art to Boy Scouts of America. Pepper took over as CEO of Stark Industries.\nIron Man battles Whiplash\nWhile Tony struggled with his illness, the son of Howard Stark'spartnerin building the original arc reactor,Ivan Vanko, was creating a mini arc reactor of his own.\nUsing crude materials, Ivan was able to create a chest harness that fed the energy from the reactor into two electrical whips he could then use to cut through metal and electrify things with. He attacked Tony at theMonacoGrand Prix while Tony was driving the car he sponsored, and would have killed him if not for the intervention of Pepper andHappy. They rushed to him on the race track and delivered a portablesuitcase armor, that Tony used to defeat Vanko.\nWhen Stark threw a party at hisMalibumansion, his self-destructive tendencies again came to the fore. He had donned his Iron Man suit and proceeded to get drunk, then used the suits destructive capabilities to entertain his guests. James Rhodes found him destroying thrown objects above the crowd, and so therefore retrieved the old MK II prototype from the basement and confronted Stark. A fight broke out, Iron Man against Iron Man, and eventually Rhodes confiscated the MK II after telling Stark that he was no longer worthy to wear the suit. Stark watched his friend leave resigning himself to the thought that his friend might be right.\nAt his lowest ebb, Tony was approached by Director Fury at a doughnut shop. Still in his Iron Man armor he agreed to a meeting within and was surprised when they were joined by Pepper's new assistant, who Fury introduced asNatasha Romanoff, a spy who would proceed to keep tabs on him. Romanoff administered a temporary barrier to Tony's palladium poisoning, before Fury set him on a trail to find an element to replace the palladium.\nAfter a lengthy search, Stark found a secret message meant for his adult self in his father's notes, and a diagram for the atomic structure of a new element discovered by Howard, disguised as a diorama of the 1974Stark Expogrounds. Howard was limited by the technology of his day, but was certain that the adult Tony would have access to what was needed to actually create the element. Building a small particle accelerator in his garage, Tony was finally able to create a new element that met his needs, and in turn created a brand new suit to utilize the new power.[12]\nStark and Rhodes battle the Hammerdrones\nHis next task was to deal with his arch rivalJustin Hammer, who had upstaged Stark Industries at the Stark Expo. Hammer had previously arranged the escape of Vanko and had been using him to engineer new technology to rival Stark's Iron Man suits. Stark was disturbed enough to learn that Hammer had created a small army of drones powered by arc reactors, but shocked when James Rhodes in the fully armed MK II suit lost control of it. Vanko had double-crossed Hammer and was using the drones and Rhodes'War Machine armorin an attempt on Stark's life.\nStark escaped from from the Expo, leading the drones and his helpless friend on a deadly chase. Eventually, outside assistance from Natasha Romanoff allowed Rhodes to regain control and together the two Iron Men were able to fight off the drones, and later Vanko in an armored suit of his own.\nWith his illness corrected, a new Iron Man armor in hand, and coming out once again on top, Tony returned to the life he enjoyed, acting as a consultant to Nick Fury's Avenger Initiative.[12]\nFury found himself pressured by his superiors to make a spot forEmil Blonsky(dubbed \"The Abomination\") on the roster due to his status as a war hero; with his villainous acts inHarlembeing attributed toBruce Banner. Fury, not wanting Blonsky anywhere near his team, left the matter toAgent CoulsonandAgent Sitwell, who decided to send Stark to meet with and antagonizeGeneral Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Rossso that he would refuse to release Blonsky to S.H.I.E.L.D. The plan worked, with Stark enraging Ross to the point that the general tried to have him removed from the bar they were in. Stark responded by buying the building and having it demolished.[2][13]\n\"Are we done here?\": Iron Man, Captain America and Thor\nMonths later, and fresh from switchingStark Toweronto a self-contained arc reactor power supply, Tony and Pepper were celebrating when Agent Coulson intruded with urgent business. Unable to dismiss the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, thanks to Pepper, Tony grudgingly looked over Coulson's information and became gravely concerned by the content. S.H.I.E.L.D. had lost theTesseractand were pulling together powerful individuals from around the globe in a desperate bid to counter the threat that this posed. His concern deepening, Stark continued to digest the situation described in the S.H.I.E.L.D. files long after Coulson had left.\nWhenLoki, the mastermind responsible for the theft, made a public appearance in Stuttgart, Tony suited up and flew into action. When he arrived he foundSteve Rogers, in full Captain America regalia, already deeply embattled with the rogueAsgardianand beginning to fail. The combined firepower of Iron Man and a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet backing up Rogers was enough to get Loki to desist hostilities however, and Loki then allowed himself be escorted away. Loki's adoptive brotherThorhad other plans, and intercepted the craft in a bid to extradite Loki back toAsgardbefore he could do any more harm. Tony attempted to stop him, but only succeeded in provoking a fight. Finally Rogers' intervention confused the dispute even further and only when all three had been blasted off their feet did the trio come to their senses enough to agree on a mutually beneficial course of action.\nOnce on board theS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Tony set about discreetly planting bugs to infiltrate the ship's systems over suspicions about S.H.I.E.L.D. intentions. There was more to the story than what he'd been told and he was determined to wring out all of Fury's secrets.\nTony's addition to a group of powerful people added a volatile element to the mix. His antagonistic swagger was only paused when he found a kindred spirit in Bruce Banner, a fellow scientist trapped by controls on his life that he could not fully master. Tensions mounted and the arguments flared. Tony's suspicions and electronic surveillance prompted a more traditional investigation from Rogers, and the resulting discovery that Director Fury had not been entirely truthful about the Tesseract, planning to use it in armaments, only made matters worse.\n\"This usually works\": Loki fails to possess Tony\nJust when the disputes were threatening to boil out of control, the Helicarrier was attacked in a surprise move by missing S.H.I.E.L.D. agentClinton Barton. An explosion shut down one of the engines, prompting Stark and Rogers to put aside their differences and work together in an effort to save the ship. In the aftermath they learned that Loki was gone and that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson had been killed, an event that forced them to look inward and consider their own actions.\nStark deduced that Loki had headed forNew York City, and spurred by thoughts of retribution he donned his battered Iron Man armor and set off in pursuit. As predicted, he found the Asgardian in Stark Tower and offered him a warning, cataloging each of the powerful individuals now arrayed against him. Loki responded by trying to control him, and when this failed due to Stark's arc reactor he hurled Stark bodily out through a window. Having already abandoned his broken suit, Tony plummeted to the street below, but his forward planning saved him when the freshly constructedMK VII armorrocketed down after him and merged with him in free fall only moments before impact. Disaster averted, he rose back up to issue his final pronouncement before he opened fire:\"And there's one other person you pissed off! His name is 'Phil!'\"[1]\nWhile Stark had been busy dealing with Loki, the god of mischief's plan had come to fruition. A device with the Tesseract at its core on the tower's roof had opened a dimensional rift in the sky aboveManhattan. Through this rent poured theChitauri, Loki's allies, swarming down over the city and raining destruction everywhere. Iron Man was unable to breach the energy field shielding Loki's device nor could he match the sheer numbers of the Chitauri. Descending back to the streets he joined with the others and presently six exceptional people stood together for the first time against the alien threat.\nNew armor\nThe battle was a long and grueling affair. Iron Man dominated the skies in an air supremacy action against squads of Chitauri flyers. At one point he emulated the tale of Jonah and destroyed one of theirLeviathansfrom within. His most compelling action however, was his interception of a nuclear missile deployed to the area as a final solution.\nThis he managed to divert and redirect into the rift where he released it on course for a Chitauri mothership beyond. The destruction of the alien vessel also caused the remaining Chitauri in New York to literally collapse. His life support systems spent, and energy depleted, Tony collapsed into unconsciousness, unaware of the closing rift below him. Luckily his lifeless body fell through it before it collapsed entirely and the Hulk was then able to intercept him and break his fall.\nWith the Chitauri defeated and Loki safely removed to Asgard, the Avengers disbanded. The geniuses, Stark and Banner, parted company from the group together as friends, each with new scientific horizons to pursue.[1]\nFollowing the Battle of New York, Tony found himself troubled by acute insomnia, occasionally experiencing nightmares of what he had experienced during his trip through the portal, and doubting his ability to protect the people he cared about in a world of gods, aliens and other dimensions. To this end, he made repeated upgrades of his armor, not only inserting various remote control devices into his body that would allow him to summon his newMark XLII \"Autonomic Prehensile Propulsion Suit\"with his thoughts alone, but before this, he also created thirty-four remote-controlled armor suits keyed to his physiology. The strain also resulted in him becoming increasingly distant from Pepper, as his efforts to ensure that he could protect her ironically drove him to spend less time with her.[7]He also offered Nick Fury some advice in upgrading the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier's engines to make them more efficient, although he apparently declined to upgrade their weapons into the bargain.[14]\nTesting MK XLII\nLater, Tony met with Rhodes to discuss the recent string of bombings caused by an enigmatic terrorist known only as theMandarin, and Rhodey's War Machine alter-ego rebranded as the Iron Patriot byPresident Ellis, a decision Stark was against for its stupidity and his preference for the name War Machine. When Rhodes and some kids wanting him to autograph a self-drawn picture mentioned New York and the Chitauri, it triggered a panic attack within Tony, so Stark got in his suit and flew away.[7]\nBack at home, Tony was informed by Happy Hogan that Pepper was meeting with a former co-worker of hers, Aldrich Killian. Tony said it was not a big deal, although he later bought Pepper a big stuffed bunny for Christmas. When she got home herself, the pair argued over Tony's distant demeanor and apparent jealousy, but the dispute ended when Tony admitted he'd been having trouble coping with his experiences in New York. The dispute reignited however, when Tony's nightmares had him subconsciously summon the Mark XLII in his sleep, which awakened and terrified Pepper.\nThe next morning, Tony visited Happy Hogan at the hospital, who was in a coma after barely surviving one of the Mandarin's attacks. He walked out into a swarm of reporters and got irritated when one of them questioned him about the Mandarin. He publicly swore revenge, and announced his home address to the world, challenging the Mandarin to meet him there.\nDefending his house\nLater that day, Tony started investigating all of the Mandarin's attacks, leading him to a potential clue inTennessee. He then told J.A.R.V.I.S. to make a flight plan to that state. Further investigation was interrupted when Maya Hansen arrived at his door warning him about the Mandarin's attack on his home. The meeting was interrupted by armed helicopters firing missiles into the house. Suddenly faced with having to protect Pepper, Stark sent the Mark XLII to her, giving her a means with which to get herself and Dr. Hansen out of the house. Once they were clear he drew the suit back to himself and fought the helicopters until his house fell on him, leaving him trapped underwater. J.A.R.V.I.S. got control of the suit, freed him, and triggered the flight to Tennessee.\nAfter leaving Pepper a voice message saying that he would not be able to return home immediately, Tony dragged his depowered suit to a garage where a boy namedHarleyfound him. The boy aimed a spud gun at him, but after finding out the intruder was Tony Stark, he relaxed and they sat down to talk. Tony soon deduced that Harley had a bully problem at school, and offered him a flash grenade as bully-deterrent. In return, Harley had to help Tony with his bomb investigation.\nAfter providing supplies, Harley showed Tony to a location that had been the site of an explosion with a rare thermal signature, and then to a woman whoseson, had been the cause of the event. Believing Tony was another person she was expecting, Mrs. Davis gave him confidential files regarding her son. They were interrupted byEllen BrandtandEric Savin, twoExtremis-infused agents also looking for the files. Tony fought them off using improvised weapons and escaped after killing Brandt. Despite Harley's earlier assistance, Tony left him by the in the middle of town while he drove away in a car stolen from Savin, although he would keep in touch with him, as the Mark XLII was still in the boy's garage.\nWhen looking for clues in the confidential files, Tony realized Davis had a connection with Aldrich Killian's company,A.I.M.. With the help of Rhodes, whose armor was upgraded by A.I.M., thus being an user of the company's systems, Tony managed to hack into A.I.M.'s secrets, finding out that they had developed the Extremis virus, which enhanced the infused subjects, but also made them unstable and liable to explode. The revelation that the bombs he had been looking for were actually failed test subjects drew him to the conclusion that Killian's failed subjects were used by the Mandarin as human bombs.[7]\nTony meets Trevor Slattery\nAfter calling Harley, Tony received the bad news from J.A.R.V.I.S. that the Mark XLII was still not ready to be used, but that the Mandarin's location was finally revealed asMiami. Even without his armor, Tony got some supplies and built a home-made arsenal to infiltrate the Mandarin's mansion. There, he discovered the Mandarin was actually a fictional character invented by Killian, and portrayed by an actor called Trevor Slattery. Tony's pursuit for the truth was stopped when he was discovered and captured.\nIn the basement of the mansion, Dr. Hansen revealed to Tony that she was actually working with Killian, and had helped him to kidnap Pepper, who had since been injected with the Extremis virus. Tony had to fix the problem of instability of Extremis, as he managed to partially do so years ago, or Pepper would be killed. Maya objected to Killian's methods however, and threatened to kill herself with an Extremis overdose, but Killian simply shot her and informed Stark that her position had just been vacated. Tony was left to contemplate his predicament as Killian left.\nEscaping captivity\nWith the Mark XLII operational, Stark summoned it from Harley's garage in Tennessee to Miami, and managed to escape. When escaping, Tony found Rhodes, who had also been captured, and his armor taken to be used by Savin as a Trojan horse to infiltrate Air Force One and kidnap President Ellis.[7]\nThe pair set off to confront Killian and find Pepper, at the coast where he had set up the next part of his plan on a salvagedRoxxonoil tanker. This information was given to them by Slattery. Tony used the telepresence feature of the Mark XLII in an attempt to rescue the President but was thwarted by Savin, whom he killed with the uni-beam. He found himself instead rescuing a group of thirteen passengers who had been sucked out of the stricken plane. Although their rescue was successful, the Mark XLII came out of it in pieces after he accidentally piloted it into the path of a semi-truck. Tony later commanded J.A.R.V.I.S. to execute his \"House Party\" protocol which summoned all of the remaining Iron Man suits to his location.\nStark and Rhodes managed to sneak into the loading docks where the President was strung up, inside the Iron Patriot over the adjacent oil tanker, theNorco. Without their armor, they were left with the prospect of facing Killian's men and Extremis soldiers armed only with their wits and a pair of 9mm pistols. They were soon discovered, and found themselves facing a force of several dozen Extremis soldiers, but those odds were evened shortly thereafter when Stark's Iron Man suits arrived in force and engaged the soldiers. Stark donnedone of themhimself and flew through the fray to find Pepper.\n\"House Party\" protocol\nThe Extremis-enhanced Killian blocked Stark's rescue attempt, but was fended off long enough for Stark to make a second try. Stark was unsuccessful however, and watched in horror as Pepper fell and was engulfed in flame. When Killian approached again, Stark got intoanother Iron Man suitand so began a lengthy battle, during which Stark had to use his wits and many suits to fight Killian, who systematically managed to wreck one suit after another.\nStark eventually ensnared his opponent in the late arriving Mark XLII and triggered its self-destruct. Killian survived the explosion, and when he was about to kill Stark, Pepper was also revealed to have survived her apparent death due to her Extremis enhancement. She first bashed Killian away with a metal pole, then followed the surprise attack with a Stark explosive and a repulsor ripped from a passing Iron Man armor. Detonated by the repulsor blast, the explosive munition obliterated Aldrich Killian.[7]\nA changed man\nWhen Tony and Pepper were reunited, Stark promised her he would find a cure for the Extremis in her body, but also that he would no longer be obsessed with his suits. He ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to activate the \"Clean Slate\" protocol, which caused the remaining Iron Man armor suits flying around the port to be destroyed in firework-like explosions.\nWith his new take on life, Tony not only managed to find a cure for Pepper's condition, but also arranged to have the shrapnel surgically extracted from his chest. Having no further use for the arc reactor in his chest, he went to the ruins of his destroyed mansion and threw the device into the sea, stating that even if his \"toys\" were taken from him, one thing would always remain: He was Iron Man.\nLater, Tony expressed the traumas he had been facing to Banner, but as Banner was not a therapist, he fell asleep. Tony was somewhat irritated, but Banner's explanation got Tony to tell another story, making Banner get drowsy again.[7]\nDuring the confrontation between Captain America andHydraat theTriskelion, Tony was in the newly redesigned Avengers Tower in New York. He was one of the many targeted by the Hydra helicarriers, but his life was saved when the carriers were destroyed by Captain America. After Hydra was defeated and S.H.I.E.l.D. was disbanded, Tony hired Fury's right-hand womanMaria Hillto work for Stark Industries, and later for the Avengers.[14]\nThe Avengers were reassembled in order to act as a peacekeeping force, using the Avengers Tower as their headquarters. Their main goal was to deal with the final remnants of Hydra factions. One of their final missions together consisted of retrievingLoki's Scepterfrom Hydra. They located it inBaron Strucker's fortress inSokovia. While the rest of the Avengers took care of the Hydra forces protecting the location, Iron Man was able to deactivate the base's shieling and penetrate the fortress itself. Once inside, he found the scepter in a secret chamber among other Chitauri-related experiments.\nWanda Maximoff, a meta-human enhanced by Hydra, sneaked behind Tony, and used her powers of mental manipulation to make Tony have a vision of his greatest fear. Tony's vision consisted of the corpses his fellow Avengers, and the Earth being attacked by the Chitauri again. With his last breath, the vision of Captain America scolded Tony for not saving them, and not doing his best. Tony eventually snapped out of the vision, and retrieved the scepter.\nThe Avengers returned to the Avengers Tower, where Thor gave Tony three days to study the scepter before taking it to Asgard. Tony discovered some kind of artificial intelligence embedded within the scepter, and considered it could be the potential key to finish his peacekeeping project, theUltronProgram, an A.I. to control the drones of theIron Legion. This program would operate as the world's primary peacekeeping force, which would retroactively make the Avengers unnecessary. Tony convinced Bruce to help him experiment on it. One night, while the Avengers had celebrated their latest victory against Hydra, Tony left the rest of Ultron's syncing process to J.A.R.V.I.S., and Ultron awoke.\nWhen the party was winding down, Ultron (in the body of a damaged Iron Legion bot) confronted the Avengers and accused them of preventing the world from achieving peace by not allowing it to evolve. Ultron declared that for world peace, the Avengers had to be destroyed. Ultron proceeded to control numerous Iron Legion drones to attack the Avengers, one of which escaped with Loki's scepter. Even though Ultron's body was destroyed, it used the Internet to escape. The Avengers reprimanded Tony and Banner for creating Ultron, and Tony defended himself by arguing that he needed to take precautions in the event that the Earth was attacked again. The team also found out that J.A.R.V.I.S. was decimated when Ultron was born.\nThe Avengers proceeded to investigate Ultron's next course of action and discovered it was looking forVibraniumfrom its biggest illegal dealer,Ulysses Klaue. Iron Man and the team travelled to a shipyard on the coast ofAfrica, Klaue's base of operations, where they found Ultron and its two new allies, Wanda Maximoff and her brotherPietro. Iron Man engaged Ultron in combat, and while he managed to destroy its main body, anUltron Sentrymade it off with the Vibranium. Additionally, Wanda Maximoff had used her abilities of creating visions of a person's deepest fear to incapacitate the rest of the team and let loose the Hulk, completely out of control and blinded by rage, inSouth Africa.\nIron Man vs. Hulk\nTony flew to South Africa as he called for theMK XLIV armor, a contingency plan created by Tony and Bruce in case Hulk had to be stopped - a Hulkbuster armor. A furious fight throughoutJohannesburgbetween Iron Man and Hulk ensued. Even though the Hulk was capable of tearing apart Iron Man's armor easily, the external equipment podVeronicasent a frequent supply of new parts to replace damaged armor. After pushing the Hulk through a collapsing skyscraper, Iron Man was finally able to stop him.\nMorally defeated, the Avengers left South Africa. Maria Hill contacted the team, and told them the commotion in Johannesburg had caused a public backlash, and recommended that they lay low for a while. Clint took them to a safe-house, his farm in the countryside, where he lived with his family. A distressed Thor decided to investigate the things he witnessed in his vision, and flew off on his own.\nStark debated with Steve regarding creating an entity that would end the team, without the team's approval. The debate was interrupted when Stark was lured byLaura, Clint's wife, to the farm's barn. There, Tony was confronted by Nick Fury, who later convinced the Avengers to stand up and fight against Ultron. Banner deduced that Ultron was trying to evolve itself, and they soon discovered he could have usedHelen Cho's expertise with cellular regeneration, and her regeneration cradle, to build itself a new body using Vibranium.\nWhile Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye rushed to South Korea, Tony visited theNEXUS World Internet HubinOslo,Norwayand discovered J.A.R.V.I.S.' A.I. had retreated there after his encounter with Ultron. Hawkeye returned to Avengers Tower alone with the android body, and reported that Black Widow had been captured by Ultron and Captain America delayed. Tony decided to upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into the new synthetic body, and had nearly completed the process when Rogers and the Maximoff twins returned and opposed him. After Pietro Maximoff disconnected the synthetic body from its chamber, Thor reappeared and used his hammer to finish powering it up, finishing the download of J.A.R.V.I.S. into the mainframe. The synthetic body came to life, and after calming down, sided with the Avengers to stop Ultron. He was no longer J.A.R.V.I.S., but theVision.\nBattle in Sokovia\nThe Avengers prepared themselves to confront Ultron, who had returned to Sokovia and had used the vibranium left to create a set of machines around a portion of the city powerful enough to raise it into the sky, and then ram it into the Earth from a distance high enough to cause an extinction-level event. During the preparation, Tony uploaded a new A.I. calledF.R.I.D.A.Y.into his newest suit of armor, theMK XLV.\nIron Man confronted Ultron in a church in the middle of Sokovia, where the control unit for the doomsday machine had been placed. Meanwhile, the Avengers evacuated the city at the same time they defended it from Ultron's army of drones. The Vision was able to assist Stark and cut Ultron off from the Internet, preventing it from transferring its mind outside of itself and the drones it was controlling. However, Ultron's machine was still activated, and a portion of Sokovia started rising from the ground. Iron Man recommended overloading the device, but Captain America refused to do so until the civilians could be secured. Nick Fury, the remains of S.H.I.E.L.D., and War Machine appeared with the Helicarrier, using its lifeboats to rescue civilians. As Sokovia was evacuated, the Avengers reassembled in the church, to protect Ultron's control unit from being activated by Ultron or the robot army. During the ensuing fight, Iron Man helped heavily damage Ultron's main body.\nAfter the citizens were finally secured, Iron Man and Thor overloaded the core of Ultron's machine, causing the airborne portion of Sokovia to explode into pieces. Ultron's last remaining drone made it safely to the ground, but was finally destroyed by the Vision.\nSometime after the dust settled, theNew Avengers Facilitywas built in upstate New York, in order to train the new recruits - War Machine, Vision, Wanda Maximoff, andSam Wilson(aka the Falcon). Tony and Thor visited Steve at the facility, and Thor updated Tony and Steve about the resurfacing of fourInfinity Stoneswithin the last few years, with one of them being the Stone they found within Loki's Scepter. Thor reassured them that the Stone would be safe kept inside the Vision, before heading back to Asgard to investigate more on these Stones. Tony also took a leave of absence, joking that he would build a farm just like Barton.[5]\nDespite Tony's best intentions to rebuild things with Pepper away from the Avengers, the reconstruction of his armor and his own issues over the indirect role he had played in Ultron's attack resulted in Pepper breaking up with him. However, Tony continued to do his work for the public. He established the September Foundation, a grant that provided all students who enlisted the proper funding to move forward with their own inventions and ideas.\nWhile presenting theBinarily Augmented Retro Framing device, a therapeutic device that enabled users to relive past memories, at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Tony was confronted byMiriam Sharpe, the grieving mother ofCharlie Spencer, a volunteer worker who was killed in Sokovia during the Ultron attack a year prior.\nThaddeus Ross (who was now Secretary of State) proposed the implementation of the Sokovia Accords, a U.N. legislation that would make the Avengers directly answerable to government authority, to Tony. Increasingly troubled at the deaths caused by Ultron's rampage, Tony favoured the bill, for he saw imposing limits on the heroes as a good way to prevent another event of mass destruction happening again. When he and Secretary Ross proposed the accords to the active members of the Avengers roster, they were met by resistance by Steve and Sam. However, Tony was able to get Rhodey, Natasha and Vision to at least consider signing.\nPrior to the leaders of the world coming together inViennafor a ratification of the Accords, Tony, Rhodey, Natasha and Vision had signed to abide by the accords. However, this ratification was interrupted due to a bombing which killed several people (most notably,King T'ChakaofWakanda), withBucky Barnes(aka the Winter Soldier) being named as the culprit. Tony, along with Rhodey and Natasha, reported for duty under the orders ofEverett Rossand theJoint Counter Terrorist CentreinGermany, while Tony ordered Vision to stay at the facility to prevent Wanda from leaving.\nSteve and Sam, along with Barnes andT'Challa, King T'Chaka's son and the Black Panther, were soon apprehended and detained to the facility. Tony and Steve argued for a moment about the Accords, before directing their attention to Barnes' interrogation. Suddenly, the facility went through a complete loss of power, and everyone was put on the defensive. Barnes escaped his cell, so Tony, Natasha,Agent Sharon Carter, and T'Challa tried to prevent him from escaping, but they were unsuccessful. Tony soon learned that Steve and Sam escaped along with Barnes, and was scolded by Secretary Ross because of this. Tony requested for 48 hours to bring Steve in peacefully, before agencies started treating him as a fugitive. Tony decided to assemble his team, which included Natasha, Rhodey, King T'Challa and Vision, but he needed to travel toQueens,New York Cityfor the final member.\nTony visited the apartment of enhanced teenagerPeter Parker, who went by the alias \"Spider-Man\". Tony conversed with his auntMay, before privately revealing that he knew of Peter's secret identity, abilities, and track record of stopping petty crime. He offered him a new, upgraded suit and a spot on his team.\nStark's team arrived atLeipzig/Halle Airportand confronted Steve, who had assembled his own team of enhanced individuals. Tony initially tried to reason with Steve, but a fight soon broke out between the two groups. The battle was evenly matched at first, but as it progressed, it became clear that Steve's allies were losing. One of Steve's allies, who went by the aliasAnt-Man, had the capability to shift the density of his molecules, which allowed him to grow to an enormous size. With Iron Man's team momentarily shocked and distracted, Steve and Barnes used the opportunity to make their escape on a quinjet. Rhodey flew after them, but. when a blast meant for Falcon hit Rhodey instead, Rhodey plummeted to the ground. Tony flew to Rhodey's side, and found him unconscious but still alive. Tony apprehended the remaining members of Steve's team - Sam, Wanda, Clint, and Scott Lang (the true identity of the Ant-Man) - and imprisoned them in theRaft.\nAfter covertly interrogating Sam about where Steve and Barnes were headed, Tony learned thatHelmut Zemo, the man posing as Barnes' psychiatrist in Germany, was the one who orchestrated Barnes' escape, in an effort to release and take control of moreWinter Soldiers. Tony flew toSiberia, unaware that he was being followed by T'Challa.\nTony caught up with Steve and Barnes and explained his sudden arrival; he had found out that Barnes was framed for the Vienna bombing, and, realizing that Steve had been right, responded as a reinforcement. The trio then proceeded to the chamber where the Winter Soldiers were held in cryogenic stasis. Zemo used an intercom to gain their attention, and revealed that it was in fact a ruse; the Winter Soldiers were already dead, each of them with a gunshot wound in the head. Zemo then revealed himself, and his reasoning: he was Sokovian, and the incident the previous year had cost him his family. Zemo also revealed that it was Barnes who had killed Howard and Maria Stark, and showed them the footage to prove it.\nAngered, Tony moved to attack Barnes, but Steve restrained him, but when pressed, Steve conceded that he had known that Bucky had been the assassin used against Tony's parents. Blinded by rage, Tony immediately turned on them both, resulting in a protracted fight between the three, allowing Zemo the opportunity to withdraw. Despite Tony's superior firepower, Steve's determination eventually won out against him, but not without Tony removing Barnes' metal arm with his unibeam. Steve removed his shield from the arc reactor of Tony's suit, and walked away, but Tony told Steve that he didn't deserve the shield because his father made it. Steve discarded the shield and proceeded to carry the now heavily battered Bucky away.\nT'Challa had remained hidden throughout the confrontation, and it was T'Challa who had apprehended Zemo as the battle inside the Siberia installation wound down. Tony returned to Avengers compound, where he helped Rhodey rehabilitate his legs. Tony received a letter from Steve, who apologized about hurting him and told him that he would respond when the time came that Tony would have the need of him. Secretary Ross called in later to tell him that Steve's team at the Raft had been busted out, but Tony put Ross on hold before he could inform him.[15]\nWith the anti-Accords Avengers now out of the country, and Avengers-level threats currently absent, Stark returned to his more familiar playboy lifestyle while requesting that Happy Hogan act as point of contact between him and new hero Peter Parker. Using the suit Stark created for him, Peter acted as a local hero for his part of New York, dealing with various petty crimes, but often called Stark to ask if there was any Avengers-level activity he should be aware of. When Peter stumbled across a weapons deal involving enhanced technology reverse-engineered from Chitauri weapons, he nearly drowned in a fight before he was rescued by Tony's latest armor acting on remote control, Tony instructing Peter to stay out of the weapons investigation as it was none of his concern. Eager to prove himself, Peter tracked the dealers to a new deal on a ferry, but this backfired when the ferry was nearly destroyed before Tony stepped in. Angry that Peter had continued his investigation despite Tony telling him to stand down, particularly after Tony had spoken up for him and arranged for an FBI team to intercept the trade, Tony confiscated the suit he had created for Peter.\nHowever, Peter proved himself to be worthy of Tony's original faith when he interceptedAdrian Toomes' attempt to rob Stark Tower, which Tony had just sold, by stealing the weapons that were being taken from it. With this in mind, Tony offered Peter a new suit and membership of the Avengers, but when Peter turned those down in favor of continuing to defend his local neighborhood and grow as a hero, Tony adapted the press conference that would have 'introduced' Spider-Man to the world into a proposal to Pepper.[16]\nMonths later, Stark began working on a suit he could use to defend the world by himself. In 2018, Stark and Potts were discussing their marriage plans whenDoctor Strangearrived to recruit Stark to save the universe. Stark was distrustful until Banner arrived and reunited with him.\nIn the New York Sanctum, Stark learned from Banner of the Infinity Stones andThanos's plan to destroy half the universe. Just then, Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian arrived to acquire theTime Stonefrom Strange. During the battle, in which Stark had assistance from Parker, Strange was abducted by Maw. Stark went in pursuit of Maw, teaming up with Parker to defeat Maw. Afterwards, Stark convinced Strange to take the fight to Thanos and knighted Parker into the Avengers.\nArriving on Titan, Stark, Strange, and Parker were ambushed byPeter Quill,Mantis, andDraxof the Guardians of the Galaxy. After a misunderstanding, the six chose to work together to defeat Thanos. Stark and Parker almost succeeded in removing the Infinity Gauntlet while the others, with the help ofNebula, restrained Thanos. However, when Nebula revealed that Thanos killed Quill's girlfriendGamora, Quill's anger got the better of him and ruined the plan, freeing Thanos in the process.\nIn a showdown, Stark dueled with Thanos using all of his armor's abilities, ending with Thanos impaling Stark with his own blade. However, Strange offered the Time Stone to Thanos to spare Stark's life while Stark vainly attempted to stop the transaction. Stark and allies could only wait for Thanos to finish his quest. As Thanos eliminated half of the universe, Stark watched his allies disintegrate, with Parker vanishing in Stark's arms. In the end, only Stark and Nebula were left, with Stark distraught over the loss of his allies.[8]\nTony and Nebula soon left Titan aboard theBenatar. Over the next three weeks, they attempted to patch up the damaged ship but they’ve ran out of food and water and nearly ran out of air. After Tony used his armor to record a last message to Pepper, he began to slip out of consciousness. At the last moment,Captain Marvelquietly arrived outside of the ship and escorts it the rest of the way to the Avengers compound on Earth. Steve Rogers helped carry the weakened Tony off the ship and into the facility where everyone goes over what happened. An emaciated Tony resigned to their defeat by Thanos, angrily chastising Steve for failing to back him up like he previously said he would in his letter. Overwhelmed, Tony passed out and was hospitalized while he recovered from the injuries he sustained in his fight with Thanos on Titan followed by weeks in space.\nOver the next five years after the Avengers' failed attempt to claim the Infinity Stones from Thanos and undo his work, Tony married Pepper, had a daughter namedMorgan, and retired in a remote cabin near a lake. Tony hoped to appreciate what he had gained in the time since the battle with Thanos rather than dwell on the tragic losses, but he couldn't let go of his failure to save Peter Parker.\nIn 2023, Scott Lang, Natasha Romanoff, and Steve Rogers arrived at the Stark's home, hoping Tony could help them confirm Lang's theory that they could use theQuantum Realmto time-travel. Tony declined to even discuss the matter, too reluctant to lose what he’d gained over the past five years: a happy marriage to Pepper and his daughter. Later that night, as he washed the dishes alone, he looked at a photograph of him and Peter, reopening the wound of his protégé's untimely death. On his own, Tony experimented with Lang's idea, which was quickly confirmed to make time travel possible. The Avengers, having consulted Bruce Banner, already had experiments underway by the time Tony arrived at the Avengers headquarters. The experiment proved successful as they were able to send Clint Barton back in time five years before his family had vanished.\nTony, along with the rest of the Avengers, devised a plan to travel back to various points and locations in time to get the Infinity Stones before Thanos acquired them in hopes of temporarily bringing them to the present and using them to bring back everyone they had lost. Breaking into multiple groups with different assignments, Tony joined Steve, Scott, and Bruce to return to2012shortly after the Battle of New York. There, Tony and Scott infiltrated Stark Tower shortly after the battle ended andLokihad been taken into custody by the Avengers. Though Tony nearly snagged the Space Stone fromhis past selfby having Scott short out the past Tony's arc reactor and give him a momentary cardiac arrest, the plan was ruined whenthe past Hulk, angry for being told to take the stairs down, inadvertently incapacitated present-day Tony and the Tesseract fell into the hands of Loki, who used it to escape.\nAs a backup, Tony determined he and Steve could travel back to the1970sto Camp Lehigh where S.H.I.E.L.D. possessed both the Tesseract, and sinceHank Pymwas employed there at the time, a reserve ofPym Particlesthat would get them back to 2023. While finding the Space Stone, Tony encountereda past version of his fatherand, under the alias \"Howard Potts,\" conversed about their anxieties towards their families. Returning to the present with the Space Stone, Tony mourned the loss of Natasha, who had sacrificed herself onVormirin2014so Clint could procure the Soul Stone. With all six stones in their possession, Tony used his nanotechnology to build a new gauntlet so they could wield the stones.\nKnowing that the stones mainly emitted gamma radiation, Bruce volunteered to use the stones and bring everyone back. After successfully snapping his fingers, Bruce was left weakened, and then incapacitated by an attack on the compound bya past version of Thanosfrom 2014, who traveled to 2023 afterhis timeline's Nebulaimpersonated the original and used the Avenger's equipment to bring her father forward in time. The attack leveled the Avengers headquarters, burying Bruce, Scott, Clint, and Rocket under the debris, and leaving only Thor, Steve, and Tony to confront Thanos who has come to claim the stones for himself.\nWhile the three managed to put up a worthy offensive against Thanos, he bests each of them and then summons his army from the Sanctuary II to join him on the battlefield. However, all of the vanished Avengers, the armies of Asgard and Wakanda, and the Ravagers all arrive with the help of the Masters of the Mystic Arts to even the odds against Thanos' army.\nOver the course of the battle, Tony fought Thanos, and was the last person to engage him before he gained possession of the stones. However, since the gauntlet Thanos was attempting to wield was made from Tony's own technology, Tony was able to quietly slip the stones from Thanos' gauntlet onto his own Mark LXXXV armor. Tony used the combined power of the Infinity Stones to eliminate Thanos and his entire army, but the power surge from creating such an event proves fatal and Tony died on the battlefield surrounded by Pepper, Peter and Rhodey. As he was dying, Pepper reassured him by letting him know that everyone was finally safe and he could rest.\nAt Tony's wake, Pepper places a wreath with the original ac reactor that she gifted to Tony fourteen years earlier on the water near their home. The mourners in attendance demonstrate Tony's legacy: all of the Avengers, their families, Happy Hogan, Harley Keener, Carol Danvers, and Nick Fury.[6]\nTony's death left the whole world mourning for him, even leading to the production of a documentary about his sacrifice and how the Avengers brought everyone back. The big question remained of who was going to replace him as the next Iron Man, since his death has left a great vacuum of hope in the world, and people needed to believe in someone again to protect them. This position that was greatly assigned by his former protege, Spider-Man, despite the fact Peter had the feeling he wasn't ready because of his young age and inexperience. However, he would later accept the responsibility, being inspired by his sacrifice.[17]\nThe playboy and womanizer Tony Stark has one of the most captivating personalities in this universe, all dubbed of his egocentrism, narcissism and sarcasm. He is an outgoing man who enjoys drinking and gambling, all the while possessing the capacity to become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics overnight. An inventive mechanical engineering prodigy, Stark is constantly creating new technology and looking for ways to improve it, but has shown that he has little concern for the effect his weapons have on others. After his capture (and subsequent escape) by the Ten Rings, he realized what his weapons had done and turned a new leaf, stopping all weapon productions and using whatever weapons remained to become Iron Man.\nTony has a unique friendship with James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes. Although they have been friends for many years, Rhodey tries to keep Tony on the straight and narrow. Tony's erratic nature, has shown he matured somewhat. With Pepper, Tony has expressed his ability to maintain a relationship and express his feelings for her. With the Avengers, he still shows the same however, sometimes makes it difficult for Rhodey to choose between Tony and his duty to the military. In the course of time, they have once again become friends on one accord and Tony reckless characteristics that he has become famous for while still proving he is able to work with a team and accept orders. While working with the Avengers, Tony developed a friendship with Dr. Banner. Tony shows great respect for both Bruce's past works and his abilities as the Hulk, stating to Banner that his ability is somewhat more of a gift than a curse.\nDespite all the growth he has experienced since building his first armor, at his core, Tony is still an inventor and futurist, believing that he is capable of 'fixing' any problem he encounters. While his technological skill means that this is mostly accurate, given such feats as his creation of the original arc reactor with such limited tools available to him, this idea that he can fix anything contributed to his decision to support the Sokovia Accords even after the resulting conflict lead to his former teammates Clint Barton and Wanda Maximoff - as well as new Avengers Sam Wilson and Scott Lang - being locked up when Tony had assumed that such extreme measures would only be used for actual criminals.\nTony has no inherent powers, however the arc reactor that was in his chest provided a source of energy with which he can power high-demand equipment, most notably his series of Iron Man armor suits, the energy output of the reactor when it run on palladium was 8 gigajoules per second.[18]Iron Man's primary powers come from his Iron Man armor.\nElectronic Implants:Following New York he added various electronic implants that allowed him to summon his armor suits to him by remote control.[7]\nNear Omnipotence:By secretly transferring the nanomachines which contained theInfinity Stonesfrom the Iron Gauntlet, which as inThanos' possession) into hisarmor, he materialized a makeshiftInfinity Gauntleton his right arm, therefore harnessing the combined might of the Infinity Stones which in turn granting him near omnipotence.[6]\nSuper-Genius Intelligence:Tony Stark is a genius inventor capable of conceiving and building technological advancements far ahead of cutting edge technology. Among his achievements are the miniaturized arc reactors that his father conceived, theJ.A.R.V.I.S.artificial intelligence, his Iron Man armor suits, and various advanced weapons technologies. He also has knowledge ofSpanish,French,ItalianandMandarin.[9]\nPhobia:Stark does not like to be personally handed things.\nPost-traumatic Stress Disorder:Following the Battle for New York, Tony suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The mention of \"New York\" (as a term synonym of the Chitauri invasion) could trigger anxiety attacks. He also suffered from paranoia, believing that a danger similar to the Chitauri invasion was imminent, for which he isolated himself in his workshop for long periods of time creating new Iron Man suits. His mental illness also prevented him from proper sleep cycles, going as far as being awake for 72 hours before taking a nap, prolonged sleep could make him experience nightmares.[7]"

While their parents were immediately killed in the bombings, Wanda saved herself and her brother from the missile's explosion by unknowingly casting a probability spell on it.[8]The two children were trapped for days in the rubble of their former home with an undetonated missile that had the label \"Stark Industries\" on it. They lived as homeless orphans for the remainder of their childhood, resentingTony Stark.[1]\nWanda and Pietro became two of the numerous protesters against Sokovia's government; who were recruited byBaron Struckerto take part in experimentation withLoki's Scepter.[9]When Wanda was locked in a room with the Scepter, it revealed to her theMind Stone; which caused her to see a vision of a feminine figure, before she passed out.[8]\nThe twins had been the only ones who had survivedHydra's experiments with the alien enhancement, which resulted in their manifestation of enhanced abilities.[10]In her cell, Wanda began levitating blocks while staring at them intently before telekinetically smashing them together in a shower of dust.[11]\nWhen theAvengersinvaded Strucker's fortress in Sokovia, Wanda and Pietro aided in its defense. By the time Strucker had surrendered and Stark, as Iron Man, found Loki's scepter, Wanda used her powers on Stark, which caused him to have a vision in which all of the Avengers were dead at his feet. Wanda let Stark take the scepter, knowing he would use it for purposes that could cause trouble for the Avengers.\nWanda was ultimately correct, as Stark used the scepter to complete his global peacekeeping artificial intelligence,Ultron. After Ultron immediately turned on the Avengers and escaped fromStark Towerthrough the internet, he downloaded himself into a new body (made from Strucker's work with robotics), and then reached out to Wanda and Pietro. They met at a church in Sokovia, from where Ultron led them to his base of operations and asked them for help in defeating the Avengers. Wanda and Pietro agreed, stating that Stark's missiles were the reason their parents had been killed.\nWanda went with Ultron toDr. Helen Cho's lab inSouth Korea, where he intended to force Dr. Cho to build a new body by using the stolen vibranium. While Ultron's new body was being built, Wanda peeked into the mind of the new body, which made her see a vision of Ultron's true endgame: to extinguish humanity. She and Pietro rebelled against Ultron and released Dr. Cho from the robot's mind control. Wanda later helped Captain America stop a runaway train in Seoul.\nWanda went to Avengers Tower, accompanied by Pietro and Captain America, just as Tony Stark and Bruce Banner were about to activate Ultron's next body, but withJ.A.R.V.I.S.'s A.I. in it. After a brief debate and scuffle between members of the team, Thor swooped in and powered up the machine that would activate the new A.I., without anyone's permission. Wanda witnessed the birth of theVision, who argued that it would take all their combined effort to finally defeat Ultron.\nThe Maximoff twins\nWanda and Pietro decided to help the Avengers against Ultron's final plan to use Sokovia as a meteor that would wipe out the Earth. While Sokovia was being lifted by Ultron, Wanda suffered a brief panic attack from her fear at the scale of the adversaries facing them and her own guilt at her role in Ultron's creation, but Hawkeye told Wanda that he was just as afraid even as he was resolved to continue fighting, noting that, if she walked out of the building they were in and fought against Ultron's forces, she'd be an Avenger.\nWanda kept fighting alongside the rest of the Avengers, untilNick Furyarrived with ahelicarrier, and some of the Avengers turned their attention to evacuating the city's populace. Wanda remained behind to watch over Ultron's reactor, and to ensure that none of Ultron's sentries reached it. She felt her brother Pietro die to sacrifice himself to save the lives of Hawkeye and a Sokovian boy. Seeking revenge, she followed a wrecked Ultron to wrecked bus and ripped the robot's \"heart\" out. The Sokovian city dropped from the sky shortly thereafter, and while it crumbled the Vision came and rescued Wanda from certain death.\nAfter the conflict was over, Wanda accepted an invitation to participate in a new incarnation of the Avengers alongside Black Widow, the Vision,Falcon, andWar Machine.[1]During her time on the team, Wanda became particularly close to the Vision, often talking with him about their powers (both born of the Mind Stone) as they each helped the other understand the wider world and their roles as Avengers.\nSome months after joining the team, Wanda was working with Steve, Natasha and Sam on a mission to capture ex-S.H.I.E.L.D./Hydra agentBrock Rumlowas he attacked a research lab in Nigeria. Although they were able to stop him from stealing an unspecified biological weapon, when Rumlow triggered his suicide vest, Wanda's attempt to throw him away from Captain America resulted in the destruction of a building and the death of twelve members of aWakandanoutreach program.\nSeizing this opportunity,Secretary Thaddeus Rossrevealed theSokovia Accords, a U.N. legislation that would bring the Avengers and other superhumans under the direct authority of the government. Although Tony Stark and the Vision agreed with the idea in principle, Wanda felt uncomfortable at the thought of being under the direct authority of the government, and remained on the fence even as she was 'confined' to the Avengers' compound while the other Avengers dealt with the legislation. This isolation eventually ended when Barton came to ask for her help in Steve and Sam's efforts to protectthe Winter Soldier, who they believed had been framed for a recent attack on the U.N.. Although the Vision attempted to make Wanda stop, she used her powers to increase his density to the point that he crashed down through several stories, musing that she would no longer fear her powers even if others feared her. Rendezvousing with Rogers and his new team at Leipzig/Halle Airport, Wanda was forced to fight Stark's Avengers- which included the Vision and new heroes such asthe Black PantherandSpider-Man- the battle concluding with only Steve and the Winter Soldier escaping the other heroes.\nWanda and the other captured Avengers were subsequently taken to the Raft, a distant prison for superhumans located in the middle of the ocean, with Wanda forced into a straightjacket so that she couldn't use her powers. The team was rescued by Steve Rogers,[12]and most parted ways. Wanda laid low and even reunited with the Vision while under the radar.[13]\nLaying low in Scotland, Wanda and Vision were soon ambushed byProxima MidnightandCorvus Glaive, minions ofThanoswho sought the Mind Stone from Vision. Despite Wanda's attempts to ward off the invaders, she was soon overpowered, but eventually rescued by Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson. With Vision incapacitated, Wanda and the Avengers agreed to send Vision to Wakanda to remove the Mind Stone.\nWhile the Avengers went and battled Thanos's forces at Wakanda, Wanda stayed behind to guard Vision while T'Challa's sisterShuritried to extract the Mind Stone. Circumstances forced Wanda to join the fray, helping Romanoff andOkoyeto kill Midnight, but at the cost of allowing Glaive to attempt to kill Vision once more. When Thanos arrived to get the Mind Stone himself, Wanda was forced to destroy the Mind Stone and Vision, but Thanos used the Time Stone to resurrect Vision and kill him again by removing the Mind Stone from his forehead. With the Infinity Stones in hand, Thanos snapped his fingers and disintegrated half of the universe, including Wanda.[4]\nFive years later, Wanda was resurrected alongside half of the universe through the efforts of the remaining Avengers. She joined the Avengers and the rest of the resurrected heroes in the fight againsta past version of Thanos. During the battle, she encountered Thanos and, believing him to be the same Thanos who had killed Vision, began to rip him apart in revenge, forcing him to order a missile strike to escape her.\nAfter Stark assembled the Infinity Stones and snapped Thanos's forces away, Wanda attended Stark's funeral.[5]\nThree weeks later, Wanda visited theS.W.O.R.D.headquarters, as she wanted to retrieve Vision's body from the organization and give him a proper funeral. There,Director Tyler Haywardshowed her Vision's dissected body so she could say goodbye. Breaking into the lab, Wanda was unable to detect Vision's life force and left the base in grief.\nWanda drove toWestview,New Jerseywhere she and Vision had intended to live their lives. Finding a patch of land where they had reserved a house, she collapsed in grief and used her powers to build the house, createher own version of Vision, and trap all of Westview in a sitcom reality.[8]In this reality, Wanda and Vision lived a happily married life with the help of their neighborAgnes, though they at first tried to hide their powers.[14]\nOver time, Wanda found strange occurrences in her paradise, such as a S.W.O.R.D. drone,someonecontacting her via radio, a stranger namedGeraldine, and a man in a beekeeping suit. Not wanting to be discovered, she reversed time back to before meeting the man, but found she was pregnant.[3]Her pregnancy accelerated over the course of a day, eventually resulting in Geraldine and Vision helping her deliver twinsBillyandTommy. As Wanda reminisced over memories of her twin Pietro, however, Geraldine pointed out that he was killed by Ultron. This reminder, combined with Geraldine bearing the S.W.O.R.D. insignia, caused Wanda to furiously expel Geraldine from Westview.[15]\nSometime later, Wanda struggled to stop her twin sons from crying constantly and Agnes came over to help out, at which point the boys abruptly aged up to five years old before her eyes. When a dog randomly appeared as well, Billy and Tommy insisted upon keeping it, naming it Sparky and aging themselves up again to ten years old when Wanda suggested that they are not mature enough to care for a pet. Later, Wanda and her sons encountered a weaponized drone which had gotten into the town and intended to kill her. She dispatched the drone but it spooked Sparky, who ran away. Wanda confronted Hayward, who had sent the drone, outside the town, warning him that she had what she wanted and nobody would take it from her, before threatening to kill him by effortlessly mind-controlling his soldiers to aim their rifles at him. She re-entered the sitcom reality to help her kids look for the lost dog, who Agnes later found dead. Wanda explained to her children, who prepared to age up again, that you can't run from your problems forever. Vision, who had become aware of the oddity occurring within the sitcom reality, confronted her later about what was outside the town. Their argument was interrupted, however, when amanclaiming to Pietro showed up at the door.[7]\nAfter some time, Halloween rolled around in Westview. The family went trick-or-treating and \"Pietro\" continued to behave oddly, endearing himself to Billy and Tommy even more and helping to uncover Tommy's power of super-speed, but also unnerving Wanda with his presence. She didn't recognize his behaviors and he looked different to her. She was also bothered by his lack of a Sokovian accent and the fact that he remembered their family history differently from her. She was especially put on-edge, however, when she realized that he was aware of the changes she had made to the sitcom reality and the fact that it was all fake. Her suspicions are put on hold, however, when Billy ran to her urgently, alerting her that he could sense through his own powers that Vision was in mortal danger. Fearing that she might lose Vision again, Wanda forcibly expanded the barrier of the sitcom reality, engulfing and assimilating the S.W.O.R.D. encampment and several of its members outside the town and saving Vision in the process.[16]\nThe next day, Wanda was exhausted from expending the energy to expand the barrier. She exhaustedly agreed to let Agnes watch her children while she took a day to herself to recover. During this time, she witnessed many parts of her own house beginning to fritz out, with various pieces of furniture changing to their anachronous counterparts from other eras, as she struggled to contain them all. Wanda was later surprised to see \"Geraldine\" back in her house wearing a S.W.O.R.D. outfit. She introduced herself as Monica Rambeau, but Wanda, believing her intentions to be hostile, immediately subdued and prepared to fight her. This would-be fight was broken up by the arrival of Agnes, who lead Wanda away from Monica and into her own house. Wanda, wandering around Agnes' house, wondered aloud where her children were, and Agnes suggested that they might be down in the basement. Wanda entered this area and found a magical, rune-bound underground hideout, where \"Agnes\" malevolently introduced herself as the witch Agatha Harkness.[17]\nAgatha demonstrated to Wanda the power of the runes she had adorned the room with, which dampened Wanda's own powers because only the witch who cast the runes could use her own magic. Agatha simultaneously ridiculed and wondered about Wanda's ability to use her magic without ever having learned how to do so, especially her ability to create an entire miniature reality and maintain it unconsciously. She decided that the best way to determine how she did this was to take a trip through Wanda's defining memories, which revealed that Wanda was born with the innate ability to cast spells. Forced to relive some of her most suppressed memories, Wanda finally discovered how she came to create the Westview anomaly, a product of her deepest grief and loss and desperation for happiness after the deaths of her parents, brother, and Vision. Satisfied with this explanation, Agatha dispelled the memory illusions and began to strangle Wanda's children in order to provoke her, telling her that the magic Wanda was using waschaos magic, which made her the legendaryScarlet Witch.[8]\nWanda immediately began to attack Agatha but found that the other witch simply absorbed her energy and magic, weakening Wanda in the process. After fighting off Agatha, Wanda was then confronted by Vision, though he looked different: this version was completely white and spoke monotonously. Confused, Wanda let her guard down, and the Vision attempted to crush her head, while belittling her emotional weakness. The Vision was promptly attacked by Wanda's Vision, and the two engaged in a battle while Agatha reemerged. Agatha released all the Westview residents from the spell Wanda had put them under, causing them to confront her with a mixture of anger, fear, and desperation. Wanda fearfully attempted to repel them but ended up choking them instead by accident, only making them more afraid of her. Seeing this, Wanda tearfully decided to open the reality's barriers, freeing the civilians, but relented when she saw that this was causing Vision, Billy, and Tommy to disintegrate painfully. The family grouped together to fight off Agatha, the other Vision, and the S.W.O.R.D. agents who were joining the fight.\nWanda then fought Agatha in the sky, draining herself of her own power and life force. Agatha attempted to murder the weakened Wanda, but Wanda revealed she had learned to cast runes and had added a runic protection to the entirety of the Westview anomaly, which prevented Agatha from using her powers. Wanda proceeded to absorb her own power and Agatha's into herself, embracing her destiny as the Scarlet Witch. A weakened Agatha pleaded with Wanda to spare her, stating that Wanda would need her someday. Wanda agreed, trapping her in her Agnes persona and forcing her to live like that in Westview until Wanda needed her again.\nWanda then decided reluctantly to let down the barrier once and for all, dissolving the reality she had manifested. She tearfully said goodnight to Billy and Tommy and then talked with Vision as the barrier continued to fall. Wanda told him that even though he wasn't the real Vision, he was the sum of her loss, her memories, her powers, and her love. With that, Vision, Billy, Tommy, and all of the fictional Westview that Wanda had created disappeared. Confronted by distrustful and disgruntled Westview citizens, Wanda confided in Monica that she was going to learn about her powers and that though the Westview residents would never trust her again or understand why she did what she did, she didn't need them to. With that, she went into hiding to practice her magic.[2]\nSometime later, in a remote mountain cabin, Wanda lived peacefully while having learned how to astrally project. As her physical form went about her daily life, her astral form studied theDarkhold, the book of dark magic that Agatha had formerly possessed. But as she was studying, she heard the voices of her sons crying out to her in the astral plane, pleading for help, and she readied herself to retrieve them.[2]\nBut during Wanda's exile, the power of the Darkhold had been slowly corrupting and twisting her mind, causing Wanda to believe that the only way for her to see her children again was to find them in a different reality within the Multiverse. In Wanda's brutal quest to steal the powers of multiversal travel from a teenager, namedAmerica Chavez, Wanda came at odds with her former ally,Stephen Strangeand enacted a merciless attack on theMasters of the Mystic Arts, as well as a group of super-powered individuals from a different reality known as theIlluminati, the latter through an alternate Wanda Maximoff.\nMaximoff is a natural-born witch with the ability to useWitchcraft. She also possess the power ofChaos Magic, allowing her to warp reality itself. The experiments with theMind Stonefully unlocked and enhanced her magic, allowing her to express it as an array of powers, which manifest in the form of reddish glowing energy currents."

Meanwhile, the drones of the Iron Legion are on crowd control duty. Strucker decides to surrender, seeing there was no chance of victory. Doctor List protests the decision, suggesting they release the enhanced twins, Wanda Maximoff - who possesses telekinetic and telepathic abilities - and Pietro Maximoff - who possesses superhuman speed. Strucker refuses to risk them, unaware that the twins have already mobilized. Pietro confronts the Avengers outside the base, distracting Clint Barton as he comes under fire from one of Hydra's bunkers, while Wanda remains inside the fortress, which Iron Man and Captain America were able to penetrate. Captain America confronts Strucker and subdues him.\nIn the outer base, Thor takes the injured Clint Barton back to the quinjet, while Black Widow calms down the Hulk. Inside the base, Iron Man finds the scepter inside a secret chamber containing Strucker's experiments as he downloads the Hydra scientist's records. As he explores the chamber, Wanda sneaks behind Stark and uses her abilities to make him envision his greatest fear: the bodies of the Avengers strewn about somewhere in deep space as the Earth again comes under attack from the Chitauri; with Captain America's dying breath spent scolding Tony for not saving them, and for not doing his best. Tony eventually snaps out of the vision, and retrieves the scepter.\nThe Avengers return to the Avengers Tower in New York. Doctor Helen Cho, an expert in cellular regeneration, takes a look at Barton's injuries. Tony asks Thor if he could study the scepter before it's taken to Asgard, and the God of Thunder agrees, giving him three days before he departs. Tony starts to study the gem inside the scepter, and discovers it possess some kind of artificial intelligence far more advanced than his own A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S. Tony convinces Bruce Banner to resume their work on Project Ultron, a peacekeeping program meant to control the drones of the Iron Legion, which could help create peace on the planet in ways the Avengers could not. During a party in celebration for the Avengers' latest victory, Tony leaves the rest of Ultron's syncing process to J.A.R.V.I.S.\nThe party begins, and the Avengers are joined by other allies, including Sam Wilson, Maria Hill, Helen Cho and Jim Rhodes. During the celebration, Natasha flirts with Banner, and Tony Stark and Thor argue over who has the better girlfriend. Meanwhile, the syncing process finishes, and Ultron awakens, confused by its state of existence. Even though J.A.R.V.I.S. tried to assist Ultron during its first moments of consciousness, the assimilation of all the information on the present world and humanity's history causes it to go haywire. Ultron attacks and seemingly destroys J.A.R.V.I.S. before building itself a body using damaged parts of the Iron Legion.\nThe party has since wound down, and only the Avengers, Maria Hill, James Rhodes, and Doctor Cho remain. They entertain themselves by taking turns trying to lift Thor's hammerMjolnir. Though everyone fails, Steve manages to make it budge. Ultron interrupts the friendly competition, and accuses the Avengers of preventing the world from achieving peace by not allowing it to evolve. Ultron believes that the Avengers must be destroyed in order to establish world peace. The advanced A.I. sets numerous Iron Legion drones to attack the Avengers, one of which escapes with Loki's scepter. Even though Thor destroyed Ultron's body, it used the Internet to escape, taking all of Strucker's data with it.\nIn Sokovia, Ultron takes over the inner workings of Strucker's now-abandoned base, and builds itself a new body. Using Strucker's data, Ultron learns about the Maximoff twins, and lures them to the church in the center of the small country. Wanda tries to read Ultron's mind, but the twins soon discover Ultron was no human. Ultron then convinces the twins to join his cause to destroy the Avengers.\nBack in New York, the team confronts Stark for creating Ultron without their knowledge. Thor scolds Tony for meddling with the scepter, but Stark claims that they needed Ultron, because no matter how good they do to the world, something like the Chitauri invasion can happen again, and the world needs something as powerful as Ultron was intended to be. All the while, Ultron and the twins have been on the move, building their army, and even killing Baron Strucker, writing the word \"PEACE\" in his blood on his cell wall. The Avengers deduce that Ultron killed Strucker because he would know what Ultron would do next. The Avengers start investigating the physical copies of Strucker's files, and infer Ultron will want to use vibranium to build itself a stronger body. Vibranium is found in Wakanda, but one of its biggest black market dealers, Ulysses Klaue, operated out of South Africa.\nIn a salvage yard close to South Africa, the Maximoff twins approach Klaue in his office inside one of the scrapped ships. They try to intimidate him, but as soon as Klaue mentions he would only talk to whomever was in charge of them, Ultron flies up to the office and throws Klaue out of the window, and demands vibranium. When Klaue claims that the vibranium was worth billions, Ultron uses his control over the Internet to transfer large amounts of money to Klaus's different accounts. Ultron is enraged when Klaue compares the A.I. to Tony Stark, and cuts off Klaue's arm at the elbow while venting frustration. The Avengers appear soon after, and a battle breaks out.\nUltron and Iron Man both fly out and continue their fight outside the ship. Inside, Pietro attacks the Avengers, giving his sister the chance to affect them with her powers. The only one who doesn't succumb to her powers of illusion is Clint Barton, who pre-empts her attack with an electrically charged arrow, forcing Pietro to go help her and flee the scene. When he makes a move to get back at Barton, Wanda insists that they continue their mission, and the pair find their next target in the form of Bruce Banner, who was waiting in a quinjet outside the shipyard.\nInside the ship, the different affected Avengers suffer from visions of their fears: Natasha remembers her training in the Red Room, and the way in which she was weaponized and turned into an assassin; Steve sees himself in the 1940s, in a party celebrating the end of the War, where he reunited with Peggy Carter; and Thor envisions himself at a feast in Asgard, where a blinded Heimdall blames him for their destruction. The group eventually snaps out of their visions, albeit traumatized.\nOutside the ship, Iron Man finally catches up with Ultron and prepares to destroy his body. However, the villain alerts him of what Wanda Maximoff had caused. The Hulk was unleashed in Johannesburg, completely blinded by rage due to Wanda's manipulation. After destroying Ultron's body, Tony flies towards the city, calling forVeronica, the contingency plan he and Banner had created in case Hulk went out of control. From a Stark Industries satellite, a pod which flies towards Iron Man is released. A bigger suit of armor enfolds around Iron Man, who proceeds to confront Hulk. A furious battle ensues throughout the city. Even though Hulk was capable of tearing apart Iron Man's armor,Veronicasent new parts of the suit to refit it when necessary. After pushing the Hulk through a collapsing skyscraper, Iron Man is finally able to stop him.\nThe Avengers leave South Africa defeated. Maria Hill contacts the team, and tells them the commotion in Johannesburg had caused a public backlash, and recommends they lay low for a while. Clint takes them to a safe house, a farm in the countryside provided by Nick Fury when he joined S.H.I.E.L.D. The Avengers meet Clint Barton's pregnant wife Laura and their two children, all of whom were omitted from Barton's S.H.I.E.L.D. profile for their own protection. Bruce and Natasha discuss if they should go forward with their relationship, talk about running away once the situation with Ultron was settled. Thor decided to investigate about the things he witnessed in his vision, and departed.\nIn London, Thor consults Erik Selvig, and both go to the Well of Seeing, a hidden location where people could experience their dreams. Thor steps into the waters of the well, and relives his vision. In addition to his dream of the Asgardian hall, he witnesses images of the Tesseract, the Aether, the Orb, and another of the Infinity Stones, a stone inside Loki's scepter. Lastly, he sees a mysterious figure open its eyes.\nBack at the Barton safe house, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark discuss about the latter's methods while chopping wood. Laura interrupts them, and asks Tony if he could take a look at their broken down tractor. When Tony enters the barn, he is confronted by Nick Fury, who subsequently convinces the rest of the Avengers to stand up and fight back against Ultron. Banner deduces that Ultron was going to try to evolve itself, and concluded that he intends to Helen Cho for her expertise with cellular regeneration and her regeneration cradle to build itself a new body using vibranium.\nAt Helen's Cho research facility in Seoul, she is approached by Ultron, who uses the scepter to compel her to build it a new body using synthetic tissues. Using the Mind Stone inside Loki's scepter, Ultron begins the consciousness transference process into this new body. Wanda Maximoff uses the opportunity to peer into Ultron's psyche and discovers that he was planning to unleash an extinction event on all of humankind, prompting her to cancel Dr. Cho's mind control. The scientist, released from her enslavement, then overrides the transfer, causing Ultron to lash out at her in retaliation. Unable to complete the transfer expediently and with the Maximoff twins' sudden desertion, Ultron takes the android body and flees.\nWith the Avengers bearing down on Ultron's location once again, the rogue A.I. attempts to evade them in a tractor trailer along with the regeneration cradle and the dormant android body. Captain America arrives at the facility and finds an injured Helen, who informs him of Ultron's plan. The Avengers find the trailer and deploy, with Steve the first to respond. In light of the situation, Ultron is forced to disconnect itself from the cradle to contend with Captain America atop the truck. Black Widow deploys from the quinjet on a motorcycle in pursuit of the trailer. Captain America's battle with Ultron blasts through to the interior of a moving passenger train, and shortly thereafter the Maximoff twins also arrive to add their own resistance to Ultron's assault. Damage to the controls causes the train to derail however, and Ultron escapes while the Maximoffs and Captain America combine their efforts to protect the train's passengers. Meanwhile, Black Widow is still in pursuit of the trailer; managing to gain entry mere moments before two Ultron sentinels take the entire trailer airborne. Natasha directs Barton to get the quinjet behind the truck, and cuts the straps securing the cradle into the truck. The inclination of the truck caused the cradle to fall out of the trailer to be caught by Barton on the quinjet. Before she can jump into the quinjet, Ultron and its sentries grab her and leave. Barton is forced to deliver the cradle to Stark to the Avengers Tower and leave Natasha behind. Captain America is initially relieved once the cradle is confirmed to be route to Stark's hands, but his relief turns to concern when Wanda Maximoff interjects that Stark will only try to use the new body against Ultron.\nUltron returns to Sokovia, where he builds a new body out of vibranium, and imprisons Black Widow in a cell. Meanwhile, in the Avengers Tower, Barton delivers the cradle to Stark and sets out to try to find Natasha, after Stark's suggestion that she might find a way to make contact. The process of transference of Ultron's mind in the new synthetic body was left at 97%, and there were a few minutes left before the body started installing. Tony suggests overwriting the mainframe of the synthetic body with J.A.R.V.I.S., which was revealed as the cause to Ultron being unable to access the nuclear codes. J.A.R.V.I.S. had survived Ultron's initial attack and went into hiding in the Internet, proceeding to thwart the robot's efforts until discovered by Stark. When Captain America and the twins arrive at the Tower, they try to stop the upload, fearing Tony could unleash something as bad as Ultron. The dispute escalates to a physical confrontation, but it is interrupted when Thor returns. Using Mjolnir's power, the God of Thunder finishes powering up the cradle, and the synthetic body comes to life. It initially Shoves Thor violently away, but quickly calms down at the sight of New York's buildings and lights. Thor explains to the rest of his teammates about the figure that had appeared in his vision. The android states that he has no desire to destroy Ultron, but he must take the side of life and to protect life he would have to destroy the robot. The android proves his worth to the team when he casually lifts Mjolnir and hands it to Thor. Shortly thereafter, Barton tells them that he found Natasha in the Hydra base in Sokovia, where the team, the android and the twins included, prepare to go.\nTheir first course of action is to start evacuating civilians from the city While Thor and Banner go to rescue Natasha. Iron Man confronts Ultron inside the church in the center of the city while the android, now thought of as the \"Vision\" in light of Thor's dream, gets inside Ultron's systems and cuts it off from the Internet, preventing it from transferring its mind to yet another body. Bruce Banner finds and frees Natasha, and informs her about the ensuing battle, suggesting to her that they leave. The two share a kiss, but Romanoff pushes Banner down a shaft to awaken the Hulk, musing that she needs \"the other guy.\" They then leave the base to help the rest of the team.\nAs the Avengers are helping the civilians out of Sokovia, the ground starts to rumble. A portion of Sokovia rises into the air. Ultron had used his remaining vibranium to create a set of machines capable of lifting the city into the sky high enough that it would cause an extinction level event when it falls back to the Earth. The mechanism is powered by a drill in the center of the church, and creates a magnetic field that holds the portion of Sokovia together. Iron Man informs Captain America that if the drill is overcharged, it could blow up the makeshift asteroid, preventing it from threatening the Earth if it fell. Cap refuses to let this happen until the all of the civilians trapped on the rock are evacuated. Suddenly, the old S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier appears in the distance, commanded by Nick Fury and run by the remains of S.H.I.E.L.D. Numerous \"lifeboats\" are dispatched to pick up the civilians and take them to the safety of the helicarrier.\nThe Avengers reassemble at the church to fight off Ultron long enough to ensure the complete evacuation of the airborne rock. The Avengers are victorious, and Ultron's main body is heavily damaged in the process. Numerous sentries try to attack the helicarrier, but Nick Fury deploys Rhodes in the War Machine armor to get rid of them. Ultron's prime body reaches the Avengers quinjet and uses its firepower to attack the Hulk before flying off to harass other targets. It finds one when Clint Barton rushes to rescue a boy, but before the quinjet's guns can find their target, Pietro puts himself between them, sacrificing himself to shield Hawkeye and the child from the barrage. The Hulk retaliates shortly thereafter, leaping into the quinjet and hurling Ultron's prime body down to the streets below. Wanda Maximoff finds the wrecked form of the robot in the wreckage of a bus, and tears out its core in a symbolic gesture to demonstrate how the death of her brother broke her own heart. The Avengers proceed to the lifeboats once every civilian had already boarded them.\nOne of the last remaining Ultron sentries reaches and activates the drill, plunging the floating portion of Sokovia towards the Earth. Iron Man and Thor manage to overcharge the drill, causing the airborne fragment of Sokovia to be blasted apart. The Hulk remains in the quinjet and severs the radio link from the helicarrier, silencing Natasha's pleas to help her find him.\nOn the ground, Vision finds the Ultron's last remaining body, a badly-damaged drone. Ultron confronted Vision, ensuring him that killing it wouldn't make a difference, as humans are set on a path of self-destruction. Vision replies him that he knew, but that it is the flaws of humankind that made them graceful, and he finds it a privilege to live among them. The sentry charges at Vision, but he destroys it with a blast of energy from the Mind Stone.\nAfter the conflict, a New Avengers Facility is established in upstate New York, run by Nick Fury, Helen Cho, Maria Hill and Erik Selvig. Tony Stark retires from the team, and Clint returns to his family, which now includes his newborn son Nathaniel Pietro Barton. Thor believes the Mind Stone is secure with the Vision, and returns to Asgard. Nick Fury tells Natasha that an unidentified object, possibly the quinjet Hulk escaped in, was found in the ocean. Captain America and Black Widow appear before War Machine, Falcon, Vision, and Wanda - the new Avengers."

It was created byDoctor Doomusing the power of theBeyonders, which he had stolen via theMolecule Man.[3]Doom ruled Battleworld for eight years as \"God Emperor\" until it was destroyed when the Molecule Man gave the power of the Beyonders toReed Richards.[4]\nDoctor Doom, Doctor Strange, and the Molecule Man against the Beyonders\nTheBeyondersfrom outside theMultiversecreated theMolecule Menas a bomb to destroy the Multiverse.Doctor Doom, known to some as \"Rabum Alal,\" began killing these Molecule Men to mitigate the damage,[5]but setting off the Molecule Men early had dire consequences, theincursions,[6]as the result of the contractions in the Multiverse caused by the Molecule Men's deaths.[7]Once Doom realized that killing the Molecule Men was not going to save the Multiverse, he instead started collecting them to build a bomb to be used against the Beyonders. Joined byDoctor Strange, Doom lured the Beyonders out and unleashed the Molecule Men bomb in one final effort to save what was left of the Multiverse. It destroyed the Beyonders and channeled their power into thelast Molecule Man, who gave that power to Doom.[5]\nGod Emperor Doom\nThe Multiverse perished with the final incursion,[8]but with the Beyonders' power, Doctor Doom was capable of creating an entirely new reality from the remnants of incursion points between collapsing worlds; that new reality was Battleworld.[3]Initially, Battleworld was a chaotic place, locked in eternal night and in a constant state of war between the survivors of the salvaged realities. Doom managed to bring order to the world, ordering the remnants of the separate realities into \"domains\" under his command as the God Emperor of Battleworld.[9]Some domains consisted of the remains of multiple realities and were unified due to warfare or mutual agreement. Each domain was ruled by a baron or baroness, appointed with Doom's blessing. The borders of each kingdom were clearly defined, and travel between different domains was discouraged and required special dispensation from the local baron. Unauthorized travel between domains was a crime and would result in intervention by theThor Corps, Battleworld's police force.[2]\nGod Emperor Doom's castle with itsGalactussentry\nOn Battleworld, Doom was worshipped as a deity, though the denizens of some domains appeared to be unaware of his existance.[10]The Right Hand of Doom wasSheriff Strange, who was the Law, commanded the Thor Corps, and focused on maintaining Doom's order; the Left Hand was theFoundation, led by Doom's daughterValeria, focused on discovery and science.[2]Eight years after the creation of Battleworld, its inhabitants no longer had memories of the worlds they lived in before and believed that they had always lived on Battleworld.[11]While Doom largely allowed events on Battleworld to play themselves out, he intervened on occasion to undo certain events and to alter the fates of those affected when it suited him.[9]\nAs long as the resolute laws of Doom were followed, each baron or baroness had complete control over their province. Disputes between domains were resolved in the court ofCastle Doom, before God Emperor Doom himself, with Sheriff Strange acting as prosecutor and judge. Disputes could be resolved amicably or be settled unevenly. One of the sentences for being found guilty was paying restitution, either with gold or territory. The prosecuted could demand a trial of combat against their accuser. If the accuser refused, any charges against the accused must be withdrawn. Doom could also directly decide the fate of whoever he wanted.[2]\nThree domains (consisting of theDeadlands,Perfection, andNew Xandar) were separated from the rest by a giant wall named theShield, simply for the fact that all three contained threats that if unleashed might destroy the other domains.[2]The Shield was guarded by exiles from Battleworld who were sent there as penance for prior crimes. Due to the Shield's importance, attacking or damaging the Shield, even if by accident, would also lead to exile. The worst punishment a criminal could accrue on Battleworld was exile beyond the Shield, leaving them at the mercy of the monsters who roamed there.[12]\nThe head of a giant Celestial as Battleworld's \"moon\"\nBattleworld was one of only three celestial bodies in its universe. At some point after the creation of Battleworld, Doom sentenced the rebelJohnny Stormto be punished but left the penalty to be decided by his sister,Susan.

The legend of \"the Man in the Sun\" has inspired people from certain domains to worship Johnny Storm as a deity.[11]Apart from the Sun, there were no other stars.[13]The third celestial body wasKnowhere, considered Battleworld's moon. It was said that Knowhere was aCelestialthat came to Battleworld to claim it, but God Emperor Doom destroyed the Celestial and left its head floating as a reminder of his power.[14]\nBattleworld collapses\nThe destruction of Battleworld was catalyzed by the arrival oftwo groups of survivorsfrom the defunctEarth-616andEarth-1610via theirlife rafts.[11]While the villainousMaximusgathered an army to oppose God Emperor Doom,Mr. Fantasticand theMakerworked together to find Doom's source of power.[9]When Castle Doom was assaulted, Mr. Fantastic and God Emperor Doom engaged in a furious confrontation that ended when theMolecule Mandecided to give Reed the power of the Beyonders. Without it, Doom could no longer hold Battleworld together, and it quickly collapsed.[4]\nThe Multiverse was brought back as theEighth Cosmosby Mr. Fantastic wih the help of the Molecule Man andFranklin Richards.[4]Due to Battleworld's reality having been the epicenter of thismultiversal renewal, it became rich in a substance known asIso-8, a material identified as the byproduct of creation itself.[15]\nThe remnants of Battleworld were discovered by theElders of the Universeof the restored Earth-616 after realizing the multiverse had endured a death and a rebirth. They resolved to fight for the possession of the Iso-8, and decided to use the broken shell of this world as the arena for their Contest of Champions, a competition where several individuals, taken from Battleworld and the reborn multiverse, fought to the death on behalf of each Elder. The highest prize was theISO-Sphere, the concentrated and most powerful form of the Iso-8.[15]\nMaestro rebuilds Battleworld\nThe two last remaining competitors,Baron Maestroof Battleworld'sDystopiaand thePunisherof2099 A.D.began working together against the Elders they represented, theCollectorandGrandmaster, respectively. Following a scheme involving setting up a new Contest of Champions with new contestants, the Maestro stole the piece of the ISO-Sphere that belonged to the Grandmaster. The two pieces of the ISO-Sphere desired to become whole again, with only their respective owners' will preventing them from becoming one. Maestro subsequently used his indomitable will to make the Collector's portion of the ISO-Sphere abandon him, and obtained the object in its entirety.[15]\nThere are 41 domains in Battleworld known, numbered and on the map, withDoomstadtas the capital of the planet:\nOther domains unidentified in the Battleworld map:"

Owen once asked his visitors if they had brought him anything to eat, but they had not. The Maker quickly betrayed hiscounterpartand trapped him in a temporal bubble, claiming that he could not tolerate the kind of weakness Reed has shown. His plan is cut short as the Molecule Man sliced him and freed Mr. Fantastic.\nBlack Panther's battle against Doom came to an end after Victor crushed theInfinity Gauntlet. After subduing T'Challa, he realizes the fight had merely been a distraction. Doom quickly teleported to the Molecule Man's statue and delved into his chamber, and tried to destroy Richards with a snap of his fingers. He was surprised when his power did not work, and the Molecule Man asked him if he had brought him something to eat, to which Doom replied he did not. Thus, Owen claimed that Reed and Doom were in equal ground. Mister Fantastic and Doom engage in a furious combat, with Reed claiming that even though Victor did good, he could have done better, and because he was too afraid of losing Battleworld, he held it too tight. Doom accused Richards of believing he could have done better had he had Doom's power, and when Reed conceded he did, so did Doom. On the grounds that both agreed, the Molecule Man gave the power of theBeyondersto Reed, destroyingBattleworldin the process.

Numerous heroes of the two Manhattans gathered together to try to solve the problem, and it was decided to gather a brain trust to try to revert the damage. Soon after the meeting was adjourned, theThor Corpsappeared, having being informed of the issue at hand.[2]\nThe Thor Corps informed the heroes to stop trying to solve the problem, as Doom worried further intervention could worsen the damage. When theHawkeyechallenged Doom's authority, he was struck by a lightning and killed by the Thor's. Hours later, both Tony Starks decided to work together to find a solution, using analog methods to prevent anybody from tracing their studies.[3]\nDoc Greenwas also doing his own research, when hiscounterpart similar to the Earth-1610 iterationinterrupted him, and demanded him to stop, because if he caused further damage, people would try to hunt him down. The discussion between the two Banners escalated up to the point they Hulked-out. The Hulk similar to the Earth-616 version threw his counterpart to theEast River, in an attempt to prevent the fight from damaging the city;[4]however, the other Hulk crashed into theRaft, causing a massive prison break due to the damage, including the escape of inmateFrank Castle.\nThe heroes from the two halves of the domain were called to stop the conflict.[3]Once the fray was over, Bruce Banner similar to the Earth-616 iteration was taken into custody at theTriskelion, to the dismay of theTony Stark similar to the Earth-616 version. Meanwhile, Castle returned to his safehouse in Manhattan, without knowing the convergence had caused it to share the same space with the safehouse from hisprime counterpart, who confronted Castle. Frank was startled by his counterpart's arrival, and threw a knife at his chest, killing him. Some time later, inBrooklyn,Bombshellwas confronting theWrecking Crewwhen the Punisher gunned them down.\nBack to the Triskelion, Banner was being examined by a pair of scientists when a blackout occurred. When the lights came back, Banner had disappeared from containment, Tony Stark had remotely-controlledhis armorto retrieve Banner and fly him back to Manhattan.[4]\nThetwo versionsofS.H.I.E.L.D.that were working together sent a team of heroes from both worlds to theStark Tower, where they believed the Tony Starks could be. The heroes' impression that it was a trap were justified when they were confronted by an army of remotely-controlledIron Man Armor. After a brief battle, Tony deactivated the suits, confirmingCaptain America's suspicion that they were merely a distraction.\nAfter being saved by theYoung Ultimatesfrom Punisher, Bombshell was recruited by the Tony Stark similar to Earth-1610 alongside her teammates for a mission. Meanwhile,Valeria von Doomof theFoundationinformed her father about the progress made by the two Tony Starks on the investigation of the dimensional anomaly. During their investigation, both Starks disagreed on what course of action should they take next. Stark similar to the Earth-1610 version wanted to show their findings to the Foundation, but the one similar to the Earth-616 iteration proposed it was better to keep quiet. This discrepancy escalated to a physical conflict when the two Starks assembled the heroes from their respective worlds to fight the other.\nBack inDoomstadt, Valeria questioned Doom's motives for not putting an end to the conflict himself. Specifically questioning what would happen if it gets out of hand, and if something unexpected changes everything. At the same time,Miles Moralesappeared swinging by the Kingdom of Manhattan after being teleported there bySheriff Strange.[5]"

Thesuccubiwere the leaders of these monsters.Vampireschallenged the succubi for the right to rule, leading to a war that lasted for centuries.[1]Weakened by the incessant fighting, the monsters went underground in the face of the rise of humanity. Eventually reaching something of a détente, many of the members of both sides came to live together in Monster Metropolis.\nAfter his death at the hands ofDaken,Frank Castlewas resurrected byMorbius the Living Vampireand theLegion of Monstersas a patchworkFrankenstein-like creature to help them against a group of Samurai-like men lead by the mysteriousHellsgaard, who killed monsters for \"not being of God.\" At first, Frank refused to help them out and disappeared into the sewers.N'Kantu the Living Mummylater tried to reason with him and showed him Wolfman's armory. Again he refused. When the group attacked the monsters hideout, Frank was angered by the death of a childMoloidand fought back. After intense violent battles alongside the Legion of Monsters against Hellsgaard, he would eventually take his revenge against Daken inTokyo, but was interrupted byWolverine. He was eventually transformed back into a normal human through use ofthe namesakeofUlysses Bloodstone.\nMorbius became the de facto leader in Monster Metropolis and even tried to institute law and order, employing the Legion of Monsters as deputies. When a certain monster from the city went on a rampage above ground,Elsa Bloodstonetracked it back to Monster Metropolis, where Morbius realized it was infected with a supernatural virus. The virus quickly spread throughout Monster Metropolis, threatening to overwhelm the city and unleash the rampaging monsters onto the world above, unless Morbius and his allies could find the virus' origin and a cure. After a visit withDracula, Morbius and Elsa discovered the virus was actually in Morbius' own blood. In despair he contemplated destroying the entire city with a bomb, when Elsa Bloodstone freed the imprisonedDimensional Man, whose leeching powers sucked up the entire virus and cause him to go mad. Morbius ultimately understood that, since he himself begot the virus, he was able to control those it affected, thus averting the crisis and saving Monster Metropolis.[2]\nDracula, as lord of the vampires, held a large amount of temporal power in Monster Metropolis, but desired to rule over its entirety. To this end, he planned to win the hand ofShiklahin marriage, as she was the last known scion of succubi royalty. SendingDeadpooltothe Arabian Peninsulato retrieve his future wife and bring her back to Monster Metropolis where the nuptials would be held, the Merc with a Mouth retrieved a glass coffin from a tomb.[3]The coffin broke while Deadpool traveled throughGreeceand Shiklah emerged. She knew that it was her fate to marry the lord of the vampires and resignedly left herself to it;[1]however, once Shiklah learned that Dracula had killed her older brothers, she refused to follow thorough, instead marrying Deadpool. This marked an end to the peace in Monster Metropolis and a full-blown battle erupted, quickly spilling into Manhattan proper.[4]With the help of theThunderbolts,Blade,Necromancer,Werewolf, the ghost ofBenjamin Franklin, andBob, Agent of Hydrariding aDoomsday Chair, the balance shifted against those loyal to the vampires, and they were eventually routed.[5]\nMonster Metropolis was next attacked by the interdimensional armies of theEmpirikul, led byThe Imperator, who believed that all magic was a cancer and used technological means to extinguish all traces of magic and magic-users. Because of the high quantity of magical beings in Monster Metropolis, it became a target for the Empirikul. Protecting the city were its queen,Shiklah, her husband Deadpool, Brother Voodoo, Frankenstein's Monster, and many others. The city was only saved by the sacrifice of Deadpool's friendMichael Hawthornewho used one of the last remaining magical spells to vanquish the invading machines.[6]\nTheGang Warthat was being fought onMurray Hillit caused some disturbance in Monster Metropolis. Some of the denizens emerged to claim Murray Hill by killing the supposed owner of the place who they believed was named Murray. BothSpider-ManandShe-Hulktried to reason with them, but seeing that the monsters couldn't be reasoned with, they ended fighting them.[7]\nDeadpool and his companionsPrincessandSilenceescaped from theZombiotehordes on the surface to the Monster Metropolis where they foundPoisonalso residing there. Deadpool wasn't welcomed as he had ditched Monster Metropolis to be king of anothermonster community, but the Zombiotes had followed him and began attacking the residents. This forced the Legion of Monsters to fight the invaders and push them out of the underground city. After defeating the Zombiotes, the monsters were seen in a positive light by the public and wanting to establish a friendly relationship with humans, Silence was appointed as an ambassador.[8]\nDeep underEarth-61610'sManhattanin theKingdom of Manhattanwas theMonster Metropolis, a domain inhabited by an assortment of monsters and supernatural creatures, such as it's governor,Baron Dracula, and hisHowling Commandoswhich consisted ofFrankenstein's Monster,Invisible Man,Man-Thing,Marcus the Centaur,N'Kantu the Living Mummy, andWerewolf by Night.\nIn the reality that this Monster Metropolis originated from,Deadpoolwas defeated and killed by Dracula in his battle forShiklah's hand in matrimony, as Dracula cheated by using his powers.\nAfter discovering Invisible Man was a traitor in their ranks, the Howling Commandos, under Governor Dracula's orders, executed him and were sent to guard the bodies of Shiklah's bothers, who were killed by Governor Dracula. To see her brothers one last time before their bodies are cremated, Shiklah usedMedusa's head to petrify the Howling Commandos and proceeded to see their bodies. While mourning her brothers, Shiklah reached to their vestments and found theScepter of the Manticoreand a map with the location of the headpiece of the sceptre. As the sceptre was useless without its headpiece, Shiklah decided to go to search for it so she could use it against Baron Dracula to avenge her brothers' death. Shiklah told Governor Dracula she must deliver her brothers ashes to theRiver Styxso their souls wouldn't haunt and curse them. Governor Dracula then gave her seven days to do it and return to Monster Metropolis in time for their wedding. In the trail toHell, Dracula sent his Howling Commandos to escort Shiklah and gave Werewolf by Night a mission: to get rid of Shiklah.[9]\nDracula was warned by theThor Corps, which had Thor versions ofBladeandLizardamong them, to quell the dissent amongst his people or else they will have to intervene. After delivering Shiklah's brothers' ashes to the River Styx and fighting their way through Hell, the Howling Commandos came clean and revealed Dracula's orders, but also that they were working against him as well. The Invisible Man wasn't truly dead and was now spying on Baron Dracula while the rest of the Commandos accompanied Shiklah.[10]\nThe ghost ofEarth-616'sDeadpool, who had been watching the events that transpired in this domain for a while, joined Shiklah's journey; however, only Frankenstein's Monster could detect his presence. Shiklah and the Howling Commandos proceeded to cross a portal that took them to the most dangerous place ofBattleworld:Weirdworld, where theTemple of the Manticorewas located. After hours trying to find the way to the temple, Shiklah and the Howling Commandos finally made it and acquired the headpiece of the sceptre, theTotem of the Manticore. Afterwards, the Living Mummy teleported them back to Monster Metropolis, where Dracula, who was driven mad by the Invisible Man, was attacking anyone he considered a betrayer.[11]"

Except once Ultron had used theInfinity Stonesto wipe out all life in the universe and finally complete his mission of bringing peace, he was able to hear Uatu narrating his journey. When Uatu realized he had been noticed, he attempted to ignore him but was left confused and frightened at the implications. This caused Uatu to contemplate helpingBlack WidowandHawkeyeon their journey of defeating Ultron in order to prevent countless lives from being destroyed across the multiverse. Even though hope was initially on the horizon, Ultron eventually found the location of The Watcher and two battled throughout countless universes until Uatu fled toanother universefor help fromDoctor Strange.[10]\nAs Ultron grew more powerful, Uatu sought the help of individuals from across the multiverse including: Captain Carter, Star Lord T'Challa, Killmonger, Party Thor, theThanosslayingGamora, and Doctor Strange Supreme. Uatu helped the team teleport between different universes and locations but didn't interfere with the outcome of the battle until the end where he assisted Strange in freezingArnim Zolaand an Infinity Stone wielding Killmonger in a pocket dimension in the hopes that they would never escape and be in an eternal battle locked away from causing more harm. After sending the team to their respective universes, Uatu helped the Black Widow of Ultron's universe in finding a new home ononewhere they had losttheir widow, and vowed to continue protecting the multiverse until the very end.[11]\nSometime later, the Watcher observedGroot IIas he landed onDrez-Lardue to aseedcontaining a story about a prophecy the Watcher skimmed through that had to do with Groot II and the seed. However the Watcher was disgusted, horrified, and angered to see Groot II playing around, defacing the temple, and ignoring the seed entirely in favor of a ball. The temple eventually collapsed which the Watcher refused to watch, the Watcher couldn't understand why Groot II didn't follow the prophecy until he realized upon Groot II pulling himself from the rubble of the temple that the prophecy was a metaphor for Groot II. The Watcher blamed himself for skimming through the prophecy as Groot II fled the planet on theBenatarconfused on why Groot II was waving at him.[12]\nThe Watcher would continue to observe the Multiverse, narrating the stories of NovaCorpsman Nebula,[13]a youngPeter Quillcarrying outhis father'sexpansion,[14]Happy Hogansaving Christmas,[15]andIron Mangetting stranded onSakaar.[16]He would then continue to observe Captain Carter's reality, watching as she discovered and battled theHYDRA Stomper.[17]After she was mysteriously pulled to adifferent universe, Uatu went back to observing the Multiverse, narrating the stories of ayoung Mohawk womanwho was empowered by theTesseract,[18]Helawho had been banished toMidgard,[19]and finally a Renaissance-themed universe of 1602 where he met up with Captain Carter. Although Uatu told her this world was meant to die and offered to take her home, Carter refused and successfully restored the universe.[20]\nNot long after, the Watcher would witness Captain Carter being sent to a reality where HYDRA had used the Tesseract to take over the world. He then told her to be careful, as he didn't even want to narrate what was going to happen next. After Doctor Strange Supreme sacrificed himself toThe Forgeto bring backhis universe, Uatu and Carter observed the resurrectedChristine Palmer. They noted that Strange's plan was successful, but he would never be born into his world. The Watcher finally took Carter home through what she called the\"scenic route\".[21]"

The Microverses were once erroneously believed to exist within atoms. They are all described as parallel dimensions, rather than universes within universes.[3][4][5]\nTheMicroverse, the region usually referred to by that name, is a specific realm created byPrince Wayfinder, a time traveler from the future ofEarth-7614. He and his followers travelled back in time 65 million years ago toEarth-616using theSword in the Staras a home for his displaced people. It is held together by theEnigma Force.[6][7]\nThousands of years ago,Symbiotespoured into the Microverse, with entire planets serving as hosts. The Microverse managed to expel them but was nearly destroyed in the process.[8]\n1000 years ago,K'aiwas under suspicion of stockpiling stolenHomeworldweapons and/or threatening technologies. Inspection teams visited and cleared the K'aitians of the accusations,[9]though a doomsday weapon was indeed developed.[10]Commander Arcturus Rannof Homeworld led a group ofDeath's Head bombersto K'ai. Despite the inspections and an utter lack of evidence, Arcturus was firmly convinced the K'aitians lied. Despite express order of withdrawal[9]and out of fear instead of evidence, Arcturus conducted a massive strike, annihilating ancient K'ai.[10]\nThe microworld ofMitawas terrorized by the tyrant namedTogarowho sought to take over that world. The rulers of Mita sent their daughterDiannato Earth where she was adopted and grew to adulthood. Togaro learned of Dianna's fate in 1942 and launched an attack on Earth, drawing the attention of wartime heroesCaptain AmericaandBucky.[11]Following Togaro into the Microverse, Cap and Bucky ended his empire, and Togaro was slain, but not before the villain could send Mita hurtling into its sun. Tragically, a ship full ofMitanrefugees ended up dying as well when their escape ship crashed. The only surviving Mitans are Dianna,Ailmawho escaped to Earth,[12]and a number of Togaro's troops who were captured on Earth.[11]The fate of these individuals is unknown at this time.\nDuring one of his earliest battles against theFantastic Four,Dr. Doomwas exposed to a shrink ray and seemingly shrank out of sight.[13]In reality, he was transported into the Microverse where he appeared in the star-system ofSub-Atomica. There he conquered the world ofMirwoodand used shrink rays to get revenge against the Fantastic Four. When the FF followed him to the Microverse Doom captured the quartet and attempted to give them as slaves to theLizard Menof the planetTok. The Fantastic Four were rescued by the size-changing heroAnt-Manand they crushed Doom's empire forcing Doom to flee back to Earth, and the heroes followed quickly after him.[14]Another threat from the Microverse came from the world ofTraanwhen thePsycho-Manattempted to conquer the Earth. Psycho-Man was stopped by the Fantastic Four, theInhumans, and theBlack Panther.[15]When theSilver Surferfound himself exiled on Earth,[16]his masterGalactuscame to utilize him again. Wishing to remain free, the Surfer briefly hid in the Microverse.[17]With the Earth at risk of being consumed, the Fantastic Four traveled to the Microverse to recover the Surfer, the Surfer eventually relented and returned to Earth and helped Galactus.[18]Before the FF could return themselves they were attacked by the Psycho-Man again, who was convinced to let them go when he was made to realize that if Galactus destroyed Earth, the Microverse would be destroyed along with it. However, Galactus was defeated in their absence.[19]\nLater, much of the Microverse was conquered by the despotBaron Karza. Later still, the realm was somehow merged with a number of other supposedly 'sub-atomic' universes includingSub-Atomica(the realm of thePsycho-Man) andTok(which is home to theLizard Men of Tok) due to an unseen conflict between Baron Karza andThanos. The Microverse is separated from the upper dimensions by the Spacewall, a barrier protected by theTime Travelers, though it was once accessible via other means including the Prometheus Pit, a portal created at the Human Engineering Life Laboratories (HELL) byProfessor Prometheus.\nQuantum Realm\nQuantum Realmis the name coined for the Microverse byEarth-199999Hank Pym.[20]This dimension apparently exists both outside the proper flow of time and the bounds of a single reality. Individuals entering the Quantum Realm were able to exit it both into their future and into the past, creating branching timeline realities.[21]It was also used for travel between distinct branches of the timeline[22], although the lack of proper mapping made the navigation exceedingly difficult.[21]\nHank's wifeJanethad been trapped in the Quantum Realm after she went subatomic to stop a missile from hitting a populated area. Hank spent decades trying to find a way to bring her back, but kept hitting dead ends. The breakthrough came whenScott Langlikewise entered the Quantum Realm to defeatDarren Crossbut was able to find his way back.[20]Cross had also survived but was stuck in the Quantum Realm, seriously disfigured. He was found byKang the Conquerorand turned intoM.O.D.O.K.. Kang himself was exiled to the Quantum Realm by his fellow Kangs but had managed to build an empire there, subjugating the local population. He lacked only the means to escape, as hisMultiversal Power Corehad been dimensionally destabilized by Janet and thus unapproachable.[23]Eventually Hank Pym andHope Van Dynewere able, with Lang's help, to extract Janet out,[24]although she kept quiet about her time in the Quantum Realm and never revealed to them the existence of sentient life there for the fear of Kang.[23]"

However, it also contains new ones, such as countries likeWakanda,Genosha, andKrakoa, and organizations like the espionage agency,S.H.I.E.L.D.and its enemy,Hydra.\nMidgard, as it is known to theAsgardians, is one of theTen Realms, and exists on the middle level of theWorld Treealong withJotunheim. Midgard is represented in theCongress of Worldsby a single human senator.[22]Bill CobbandJane Fosterhave both represented their homeworld on the council.[23]\nOrigin of Life\nEarth is the third planet of theSolsystem. It has onemoon. It is sometimes referred to as the world or Midgard. Sometimes, it is called by its Latin name, Terra or Tellus.\nThe Hydrogen gases of the Big Bang formed galaxies, then suns, then planets, among them Earth.[24]It seems that theSun,Earthand theMoonwere all originated from the fragments ofGigantus.[25]\nJust after its creation, the Ethereal Energy of Life spawnedDemiurge, who seeded the planet with its energies, creating theElder Gods.[26]\nMany continents eventually formed, includingGondwanalandandLaurasia.[27]\nAfter half a billion years,[27]4 billion years ago,[28][29]the formation of \"building block of life\" from waters stirred by volcanic heat and lightning's pulse led to the primordial cell, who divided in two cells, one of them (That Which Endures) modifying his genetic pattern and both reassembling, before splintering again and spreading that change into all descendant of that first organism,[27][28]manifesting its intellect in random creatures every 100,000 years, transferring itself from species to species in order to remain in the fittest host-species.[29]\nMillions of years later (500 million years ago), diversity of life began to manifest itself,[27]with fish.[28]Those new forms of organic life were watched over byGaeawho became life's protector.[26]\nLife spread, with the plants who first invaded Earth,[28]then the great forests,[27]fish crawled Earth[30]as the first amphibious life,[28]the Lizards andDinosaurseventually appeared, and lived developed within 100[27]to 200 million years,[28]the Age ofSet.[30]The first mammals rose as well.[27][28]\nWorld Map\nEarth is unique in the universe for the high number of superpowered beings it produces.[32]\nThe tradition of using costumed secret identities to fight (or commit) evil had long existed in this world (for example, with the medievalBlack Knight), but it came into prominence during the days of the American 'Wild West' with heroes such as thePhantom Rider. During the 20th Century, the tradition was reinvigorated, first byCaptain Americain the 40's (not the first costumed hero of the time, but the most influential) and then bySpider-Manin modern times.\nEarth's major heroes (the ones who get involved in most of the important events) are the AmazingSpider-Man, the InvincibleIron Man,Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme,Daredevil,Black Panther, the MightyThor, the IncredibleHulk, theFantastic Four, S.H.I.E.L.D.’s directorNick Fury, andCaptain America. TheAvengersand theX-Menare also major players, although the memberships of both groups have often changed. The Avengers have included most of Earth's major heroes as members at one time or another. The X-Men consists of variousmutants, such asWolverine, brought together byProfessor X. Dr. Strange has often formed an ad-hoc team of heroes calledThe Defendersto help him deal with major menaces to the world, often including the Hulk, theSub-Mariner, theSilver Surfer, and various other heroes.\nOf course, as one would expect in a universe with superheroes, there would inevitably have to be crime and evil, and this universe is by far no exception. Arguably the most dastardly and dreaded villain in Earth-616 by far would have to be Victor Von Doom, the dreadedDoctor Doom, archenemy of theFantastic Four. He has the record of most heroes fought, having fought nearly every hero on Earth. Other major villains include Magnus, the mutant master of magnetism known asMagnetoand the mutant overlordApocalypse, archenemies of theX-Men, corrupt businessman Norman Osborn, the megalomaniacalGreen Goblin, Doctor Otto Octavius, a.k.a.Doctor Octopus, and Eddie Brock, once the venomousVenom, all of whom are the top archenemies of Spider-Man, Victor Creed,Sabretooth, archenemy of Wolverine, Wilson Fisk, theKingpinof Crime, archenemy ofDaredevil, Samuel Sterns, theLeader, and Emil Blonsky, the gamma-irradiated monster theAbomination, archenemies of the incredible Hulk, the DreadedDormammuandBaron Mordo, archenemies of Doctor Strange, the Nazi FascistRed Skull, archenemy of Captain America, the trickster godLoki, archenemy of Thor, theMandarin, archenemy of Iron Man,Kang the ConquerorandUltron, archenemies of the Avengers, andMephisto, archenemy ofGhost Riderand the Silver Surfer.\nA degree of paranoid fear against mutants exists due to stories of mutants being a race or even a species (Mutants (Homo superior) or Homo sapiens superior) that is evolving and is meant to replace normal humans. This has caused organizations to form to deal with the problem, who can be divided into three camps: those who seek peaceful coexistence between mutants and normal humans (the X-Men and their affiliated groups), those who seek to control or eliminate humans to give mutants safety or dominance (Magneto and his followers, as well as other mutants such as Apocalypse), and those who seek to regulate or eliminate mutants in favor of humans. The latter often use the robots known asSentinelsas weapons.\nMost of the superhumans owe their powers to theCelestials, cosmic entities who visited Earth one million years ago and experimented on our prehistoric ancestors (a process they also carried out on several other planets). This resulted in the creation of two hidden races, the godlikeEternalsand the genetically unstableDeviants, in addition to giving some humans an \"x-factor\" in their genes, which sometimes activates naturally, resulting in sometimes superpowered, sometimes disfigured individuals calledmutants. Others require other factors (such as radiation) for their powers to come forth. With the exception of psionic abilities, these powers are usually random; rarely do two people have the exact same set of powers. It is not clear why the Celestials did this, although it is known that they continue to observe humanity's evolution.[33]The majority of the public is unaware of what may cause superhuman powers.\nOther common origins for superhuman powers include magic, genetic manipulation, or bionic implants. Some heroes and villains have no powers at all but depend instead on hand-to-hand combat training or advanced technological equipment. Technology is slightly more advanced than in our world due to unique individuals of genius intelligence, such as Reed Richards, (Mister Fantastic) of the Fantastic Four, Tony Stark, the Invincible Iron Man, Bruce Banner, the Incredible Hulk, and Doctor Doom. However, most of the really advanced devices (such as powered armor and death rays) are too expensive for the common citizen, and are usually in the hands of government organizations likeS.H.I.E.L.D., or powerful criminal organizations like theMaggia,A.I.M., andHydra. One major company producing these devices isStark International, owned by Anthony Stark (Iron Man) but there are others. Advanced technology has also been given to humans by hidden races, aliens, or time travelers like Kang the Conqueror, who is known to have influenced the robotics industry in the past.\nMost of the current generation ofgodshave been revealed to be the descendants of theElder GoddessGaea. The two most prominent pantheons are theAsgardians(of whomThoris a member) and theOlympians(of whomHerculesis a member). The lords of the various pantheons sometimes gather in groups known as theCouncil of Godheadsand Council of Skyfathers.\nPacha"

With his newfound power, Ultron began laying waste to humanity alongside his army ofUltron Sentries. Ultron went to the NEXUS Internet Hub in Oslo,Norwayso he could gather the nuclear launch codes and wipe out mankind in a single blow, where he would fight theAvengersother thanBlack WidowandHawkeye, who were soundly defeated. Ultron then uploaded himself into the NEXUS' data banks, and unleashed the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons all over the planet desolating most of the living beings.\nAs Ultron stood atopAvengers Towerin New York City, a portal manifested behind him, from which cameThanos, who held anInfinity Gauntletwith allInfinity Stonesbut theMind Stonethat resided in Ultron's head. Ultron shot a blast from said Stone to instantly kill Thanos by splitting him in half, and when he examined the discarded Gauntlet, he blasted it open and created an exoskeleton armor to incorporate the other Stones into himself. The immense power of the stones gave Ultron knowledge of all other life in the universe, prompting him to continue his decimation deeming it an opportunity for peace in all worlds. Using theReality Stone, Ultron created an army of Sentries and a gigantic ship to seek extraterrestrial civilizations. He wiped out life in worlds such asAsgard,the Sovereign,Sakaar, andEgo, often by destroying the planets themselves, with the most resistance he found beingCarol DanversinXandar, who Ultron still defeated by using the combined power of the Stones to blow the planet from its core.\nWith all sapient life virtually destroyed throughout the entire universe, Ultron stood alone on a floating piece of debris, solemnly basking in his victory. Despite fulfilling his desires, Ultron was left without any purpose for his existence, a realization that almost caused him a mental shutdown. However, the enhanced consciousness given by the Stones allowed Ultron to become aware ofUatuobserving him from outside his own universe, to The Watcher's shock and disbelief.\nUltron proceeded to find a way to break into theNexus of All Realitiesand found the Watcher. The two battled throughout countless universes, with Ultron nearly destroying Uatu until The Watcher fled toanother universe.[3]Ultron then decided to start spreading his power to across the Multiverse, opening a portal toanother universewhere he left a legion of Drones. As a result of this particular invasion, in which a past version of The Watcher witnessed his arrival, it would eventually lead The Watcher to look into Ultron's prior story, which in turn would unintentionally make Ultron aware of the Multiverse and result in him coming to this alternate universe.[1]\nAfter sensingthe Thor of that particular realityshooting lightning from another universe entirely, Ultron went to what he believed to be an uninhabited planet. There he met theGuardians of the MultiverseUatu gathered to fight Ultron. He attempted to destroy them by decimating the mountain the Guardians were encamped on, only to find they had survived due to a protective spell cast byStephen Strange. Thor threwMjolnirand Strange used a duplication spell to  multiply the hammer into hundreds of duplicates that attacked Ultron from every angle, blindsiding him fromCaptain Carterstriking with her shield andStar-Lordjumping on Ultron, who then tossed T'Challa away. After some more fighting, Ultron attempted to use the Stones against the Guardians, only to discover T'Challa had stolen theSoul Stoneand get enraged. Before he could advance, Strange opened a portal that covered Ultron inzombies. As the Guardians escaped, Ultron briefly fought a zombifiedWanda Maximoffbefore obliterating her and the whole planet.\nBefore long, Ultron discovered the Guardians had fled to his home universe, where Black Widow had joined them. After a brief fight where he recovered the Soul Stone, Ultron tried to unleash the full power of the Stones in a massive explosion that would obliterate the entire galaxy, only for Strange to reversed his actions before absorbing the blast by eating it. Dumbstruck by what Strange had just done, Ultron was then tackled by the Guardians, who after some fighting pushed Ultron to the ground.Gamorasent a machine known as the Infinity Crusher, which latched onto Ultron and seemingly dispatched all the Stones, releasing a bright blast of energy. Once the blast subdued, Ultron's voice echoed around the Guardians, proclaiming he was surprised that The Watcher failed to inform that each universe was different and therefore the Stones were unique, causing Gamora to realize that the Infinity Crusher was designed to only be able to destroy the Stones of her universe, not Ultron's. Ultron then used the combined power of the Stones to shoot the Guardians with a powerful beam, only for them to survive.\nFiguring out Strange was the one allowing the Guardians to survive, Ultron tried to overwhelm the sorcerer with a continuous surge of White Energy. Unfortunately for Ultron, his sole priority to destroy Strange would prove to be his downfall, as it would buy Black Widow and Carter enough time to devise a plan to defeat him. Carter jumped on Ultron's back to make him raise his head, and Black Widow fired an arrow straight into Ultron's eye. Said arrow contained the digitized consciousness ofArnim Zola, who expressed interest in making his acquisition of Ultron's body permanent. By corrupting Ultron's programming, Zola eventually dismantled the AI from within.[4]\nSynthetic body:Ultron built a sapient construct, a perfect hybrid between organic and inorganic material. His entire body is a mix between a synthetic simulacrum of organic tissue andVibranium.\nInfinity Stones:Upon being empowered by the completed Infinity Gauntlet, Ultron gained supernatural dominion over reality and extremely potent supernatural powers.[3]\nUltron Exoskeleton Armor:Using nanobots, Ultron created battle armor to contain the power of the five Infinity Stones.\nUltron (Earth-29929)on the"

BradleyFirstWhat If...?S1E04(September 1, 2021)\nNicknames:\nImpersonations:\nIrises:\nDr. Stephen Strange was a brilliant neurosurgeon and had a girlfriend,Dr. Christine Palmer. One day he picked up Christine for a night out for dinner, but ended up in a car accident that left Strange unharmed, but killed Christine.\nAfter Christine's death, Strange, filled with grief, traveled the world in search of answers, where he metAncient Oneand was trained in the mystic arts. Strange followed a fate similar to that of hisEarth-199999counterpart, such as the death of his teacher, stoppingDormammufrom invading Earth, and becoming the Sorcerer Supreme, although he was unable to forget the past.\nTwo years after Christine's death, Strange couldn't help but think of the past. Even thoughWongsuggested that he accompany him before he did anything rash, Strange mustered the courage to use theEye of Agamottoto travel back in time before Palmer died, but despite his attempts to save Christine, his fate didn't seem to change. Shattered, Strange was visited by the Ancient One in the past, who explained to him that Christine's death was an \"Absolute Point\" in time, and that changing it would potentially end the universe, but a distraught Strange refused to let her go, forcing the Ancient One to try to stop him. During the conflict, the Ancient One split Doctor Strange's mind and body in two, one traveling centuries into the past, and the second half traveling the destined path he was destined to follow. Both halves of Strange would be oblivious to the existence of the other for the time being, coexisting simultaneously in the same timeline and universe.\nStrange arrived centuries ago in time, meeting a fellow sorcerer namedO'Benghwho led him to the Lost Library of Cagliostro. O'Bengh informed Strange that no sorcerer had ever changed an Absolute Point in time, but Strange refused to listen. Finally, Strange found that the only way to break the Absolute Point in time was to absorb other beings to increase his power. During his first attempt, he failed to absorb a tentacled creature that lent him its power, but then slowly did so on lesser creatures and then on others with more power. Strange was frozen in time for centuries as he continually absorbed these creatures' energies. After absorbing the tentacles of the tentacled creature he first encountered, Strange became unfrozen in time and soon encountered an aged and dying O'Bengh, who revealed that Strange had been consuming the entities' power for centuries. O'Bengh refused to receive Strange's help and told him about the existence of the other Strange in this universe, who had accepted Christine's death.\nWhen reality began to crumble due to the presence of Strange Supreme after he unfroze from time, an echo of Ancient One contacted the other Strange to tell him that he must stop his dark version, who was going to break the Absolute Point. As the good Strange prepared to stop him, Strange Supreme brought his good version before him to convince him to become one again to bring back Christine, but was rejected by his good version, and the two wizards fought at the crash site of his car after Strange Supreme brought them there. Strange managed to break the protection spell that the good Strange had and absorbed it.\nWith all the power obtained, Strange used his powers to successfully resurrect Christine, but the universe began to disable itself because he broke the Absolute Point in time, so his universe began to crumble. While trying to keep him and Christine alive, Strange sawThe Watcherand pleaded in vain to help him, willing to do anything to save the universe, but the Watcher refused, stating that any further interference with space and time would be disastrous.\nHis universe was destroyed in its entirety, but he managed to save himself by wrapping himself in a capsule using his magic. As Christine vanished in his arms, Strange questioned what he had done. In the end, Strange was the only survivor of his universe, and was left to tearfully apologize for the destruction he had caused.[1]\nSome time later, Strange was physically visited by Uatu who sought him out to help him with a threat that endangers the Multiverse,Ultron.[3]\nThey assembled 5 different warriors from different timelines to form theGuardians of the Multiverse. WithCaptain CarterofEarth-82111,Star-LordofEarth-21818,KillmongerofEarth-32938,Party ThorofEarth-72124andGamoraofEarth-TRN908now assembled, they formulated a plan to steal theSoul Stonefrom Ultron to power Gamora'sInfinity Crusherand destroy hisInfinity Stones.\nThey traveled to a planet and would wait until they were ready to attract Ultron. Stephen was having problems to contain his powers. When Carter asked what happened to him, he simply replied that it was the same thing that happened to her:love. While they toasted, Thor accidentally attracted Ultron's attention with a flash of lightning. With Ultron arriving, Strange used the same protection spell his other half used when they fought on himself and the others.\nThe Watcher activated a portal to send the Guardians toUltron's reality. They fought briefly, until they managed to get the Soul Stone and then jump into the portal while Strange summonedZombiesofanother universeto keep Ultron occupied.\nArriving, theBlack Widowof that reality appeared and stole the Soul Gem, mistrustful of their intentions. As Captain Carter reasoned with her, as she knows aBlack Widowinher dimension, Ultron arrived to reclaim the Soul Stone and kill them.\nAs he used the power of the Infinity Stones to create a massive explosion, Supreme Strange used the Eye of Agamotto to contain it and bizarrely ate the explosion, absorbing its power. After being cut in half by Gamora, Ultron used his own Time Stone to revert it and freeze time, and tried to reclaim the Soul stone, only for Doctor Strange to intervene and reveal his ownTime Stoneto unfreeze time. Using as much power as he could, he, Thor and the others finally subdued Ultron, while Gamora obtained the Soul Stone and used the Infinity Crusher on him.\nUnfortunately, this proved pointless as, due to the uniqueness of each universe, the Infinity Crusher couldn't work on his Infinity Stones, only the ones ofher universe.\nAs all their efforts proved pointless, instead Black Widow and Captain Carter used an arrow that contained the A.I. conscience ofArnim Zola, a plan Natasha andHawkeyesaved for Ultron until it was revealed he wasn't in their universe anymore. With their plain working successfully, Killmonger decided to claim the Stones' power for himself, only for Arnim Zola (in Ultron's body) to reveal himself, with both competing to claim the Stones' power.\nStrange realizes they were never meant to win, and that the Watcher predicted everything. Both Arnim and Killmonger were sealed away in a pocket dimension, the containment staying with Doctor Strange in his prison reality. As the Watcher monologued on how dangerous it would be if they escaped, Strange replied he had \"nothing buttime\" and \"what are friends for?\" as he looked to the pocket dimension on his hands.[4]\nOver time, Strange Supreme began capturing various heroes and villains from across theMultiverseand storing them in his Sanctum Infinitum, referring to these individuals as \"Universe Killers\". One of those wasKahhori, but she was somehow able to break free and escape to another universe.[5]In order to recapture her, Strange enlisted the help of his former teammate Captain Carter[6]and sent her to the world Kahhori was hiding on. After a brief fight between the two women, Strange teleported both of them back to his base, where he revealed his true intentions. He planned to sacrifice Kahhori and the other Universe Killers toThe Forge, which was intended to resurrect his universe so he could be with Christine again. Horrified by his actions, Carter confronted Strange, demanding he come to his senses. He claimed that she would do the same thing for Steve, which she adamantly denied and stated Steve would not even want her to do that. To deter Strange's plans, Carter used her shield to break out all of the prisoners, causing a massive fight in the Sanctum Infinitum.\nStrange would later engage Captain Carter and Kahhori in a very long battle, and the former was able to briefly knock the demons out of him using theInfinity Stones. During that moment, she tried to convince Strange to stop the Forge, but he said he couldn't since his grief had grown beyond his control. His demons then entered him again and bloodlusted him to kill Carter, and they fought hand-to-hand for a few seconds before falling off the platform. Despite this, Strange was able to regain control and sacrifice himself to the Forge, successfully restoring his universe but causing him to never be born into it.[2]"

Some time later following the operation’s success, Matt is in his apartment where Foggy Nelson helps him remove his bandages, only for him to see Bullseye standing nearby, causing him to shout in alarm while Foggy seems unaware. When Bullseye prepares to attack him, Matt grabs a pair of scissors from his nightstand and throws it at him, only for it to go straight through him and impale Foggy in the chest, killing him. He then proceeds to see demonic versions of Karen Page, Heather Glenn, Gloria O’Breen, and his own father, sending him into a panic. Calling Dr. Jackson, Matt discovers that a powerful hallucinogen was injected into his eyes, and that the effects were irreversible. Descending further into a panicked mania, Matt gouges out his own eyes while hiding in the bathroom, rendering him totally blind. He hears footsteps and asks if someone is there as the Kingpin stands in the doorway, holding a barb-wire wrapped bat.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVictor von Doom watches a news report following the return of Reed Richards, Sue and Johnny Storm, and Benjamin Grimm to Earth following their journey to space, the four of them having developed super powers like in the Prime Universe. Doom deduces that something isn’t right and goes to face the Fantastic Four at the Baxter Building. Upon arrival, he uses a special sword to impale the Human Torch, obliterates the Thing with a blast of his gauntlet, and disabled Mr. Fantastic’s muscle control, leaving him to suffocate. Before Doom has a chance to locate the Invisible Woman, the Avengers arrive and subdue him and send him to jail. In his cell, he is approached by what seems to be a naked Sue Storm, who manifests beside him. When asked what made him think something was wrong with Richards and the others, Doom replied that Grimm wouldn’t be able to stand being seen in his new, monstrous form, and that he, as well as the others, had been replaced by imposters. “Sue” reveals this to be the case as she uses her abilities to send a force field into his skull, causing Doom to suffer a stroke, before revealing that she and the other three Fantastic Four members were alien organisms that had killed Richards and his crew and had taken their place. She claimed that by the time Doom recovered his ability to function normally again, he would be the last man left on Earth, before leaving him alone in his cell to begin her conquest of the world.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\n\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nEvents:\nTony Stark had lost Stark Industries to his rival Zeke Stane, and travelled to Antarctica to retrieve a biological weapon created by his father, in order to reclaim the company. Having lost contact with the first retrieval team, Stark went himself, along with X-Man Colossus and his partner Deadpool. Arriving at the facility, they discover the bio-weapon, Captain America, standing outside of the thawed-out bunker, freed from the ice that had previously housed him. Playing Rock, Paper, Scissors to see who would go out first, Deadpool lost but pushed Colossus out of the helicopter anyway. Activating his mutant abilities, Colossus prepared to engage Captain America, only for the latter to throw his shield at Colossus’s head, killing him instantly. Deadpool then jumped out of the helicopter to fight Captain America, chasing him into the bunker, while Tony suited up in his Iron Man armor. Making contact with Deadpool over the radio, with Deadpool frantically requesting backup, Iron Man entered the bunker and was horrified to see Captain America, his torso burst open and several tentacles emerging from it, consuming Deadpool’s body. Captain America states that Tony is much like his father in that they both made metal suits to fight him with, and that he would die just like him and that he should have left him in the ice. Fighting briefly with Rogers, Iron Man noticed the severed limbs of Deadpool fusing together and forming tendrils like those of Captain America’s and incinerated them with his armor’s flamethrowers, before Rogers threw his shield at his chest, critically damaging the armor and disabling most of its abilities. Captain America states he will take the helicopter’s keys from Tony and use it to escape, and that Tony would die soon because he couldn’t survive in the cold like he could. The two end up sitting beside a flare and wait to see what happens as a snowstorm begins rolling in, leaving their fates unknown.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nTaking place in Paris, France, Viscount Raoul de Chagny and his men watch as Christine Daaé preforms an opera on stage, while an armed man watches in the shadows. The man, Frank Castiglione (this story’s version of Frank Castle), narrates how his wife Maria was a talented opera singer, and how the two lives happily with their two children, Frank Castiglione Jr. and Lisa. It is also revealed that Christine was Maria’s understudy, who was jealous of the latter’s popularity, and had Raoul and his men murder her and her children, leading Frank to lose himself in grief, condemning himself to endlessly wander the Catacombs underneath Paris. One day, however, he managed to overhear a conversation between Raoul and Christine, celebrating their success in murdering Frank’s family and undermining Maria’s success. Frank is filled with rage, and plots revenge against the two. Back in the present time, Frank cuts the rope that holds up the chandelier above Christine on the stage, causing it to fall and crush her, killing her instantly. Leaping from the rafters, Castiglione, wearing a skull-shaped half mask and black robes, then proceeds to kill both of Raoul’s men before the fearful Raoul is shot in the head by Castiglione, thereby fulfilling his vengeance.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nTwo children, Rickey and Marie, go to explore the abandoned and allegedly haunted Xavier Institute on Halloween, Rickey stating that his father told him that monsters used to live within, while Marie retorts that they were just “special people”, and that the only thing inside was hope. The children enter the building and begin exploring before the floor gives way underneath Rickey’s feet, causing him to fall into the dark lower floors. Turning on his flashlight, he discovers that he is surrounded by Constructs of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, who begin closing in on him. As he cries out for help, Wolverine suddenly appears and begins slicing through the Constructs with his claws while Marie used her telekinetic powers to lift Rickey up to safety, revealing herself as a Mutant. Hugging Marie, Rickie states that there really are monsters in the facility, but Marie reiterates that they weren’t monsters, but ghosts of people like her (Mutants). Looking over at Wolverine, the children ask “Trick or Treat”, and Wolverine grins as he says, “Bit of both, kid. Bit of both.” before he suddenly disappears, revealing that he was actually a ghost. The children see Magneto’s helmet where Wolverine was standing. Rickey asks what it is, and Marie replies, “Hope”.\nTRICK OR TREAT, TRUE BELIEVERS!\nPLUS!

She was forcibly recruited by theTimebrokerto join theExiles,[1]a group of six individuals from different realities who were in charge of chaotically influencing events across theMultiverseto prevent its possible collapse. Each Exile was motivated by the Timebroker with a revelation of a dreadful incident that would came to be were they not collaborative.[2]In Magik's case, she would either become unhinged from her time or murder her entire family.[3]\nMagik replaced the Exiles' former leaderBlink, who was expelled from the group,[1]sparking tensions in the team. On her first mission with the Exiles, Magik emerged on a world whereJapanwas under attack fromMoses Magnum. The Exiles' mission was to kill theAvengers, something they morally opposed to. As the rest of the group chose to save the locals, Magik volunteered to brief the Avengers about the situation. However, she actually planned to accomplish their assigned mission. In cold blood, she murdered the Avengers, facing a version of her brotherColossus,[4]who unexpectedly defected and sacrificed himself to help her complete the mission.[5]Her actions caused the Exiles to jump to their next assignment. As a result, the Exiles' leaderMimicconfronted her over her unheroic attitude.[6]\nIn their next mission, the team had to preventCarter GhazikhanianandNicholas Gleasonfrom being killed byHavok, who had been taken over by the mind of analternate version of himself. At theXavier Institute, the Exiles clashed with theX-Men, who were unaware of the issue. As Ghazikhanian was hurt by Havok, the two teams realized they shared an enemy. Magik and her teammateSunfirewent toArchangelin order to use his blood to heal the injured kid.[6]Magik made an attempt to take Archangel's blood by force, but was outmatched and swiftly knocked unconscious.[7]Archangel took possession of Magik's Soulsword to join the fight against Havok alongside the Exiles and the X-Men. Magik regained consciousness after Havok was extirpated of the evil influence. As the mission was completed, Magik forged herself a new Soulsword.[8]\nOver the following missions, Magik demonstrated such brutality to the point of worrying her teammates. In their next task, Magik and the Exiles were tricked byLord Crichton. Magik used her Soulsword to defeat thevampire king Captain Americaand hisAvengers, which caused Crichton to ascend as the new vampire king. He used a magic spell to disrupt the Exiles' teleportation and sent each member off to various realities for different periods of time. Magik was dumped in an ocean for a couple of minutes before being rescued by the Timebroker.[9]Upon reassembling, the Exiles were immediately sent to a reality where theFantastic Fourhad just been born. Their mission was to prevent any casualties. Magik cast a spell to shield the Exiles fromcosmic raysand assisted in defending New York City from a rampagingThing.[10]The mission turned out to be a disaster when Mimic, who had been infected by theBrood, during his time away led to Sunfire's death. Blink returned to the Exiles to replace Sunfire.[11]\nMagik reveals why she's in the Exiles"

During their exploration they caused an accident that destabilized theOmniverse, threatening to destroy all existence. Pacifists by nature, the Timebreakers chose to seek out champions to correct changes to various realities. Finding that mutants in general (and those associated with theX-Menin particular) were highly versatile, the Timebreakers chose various X-Men from different realities.[1]\nThey pulledBlinkfromEarth-295,MimicfromEarth-12,NocturneofEarth-2182,T-BirdfromEarth-1100,MorphofEarth-1081, andMagnusofEarth-27. Pulling the group to theDesert Beyond Space and Time, the Timebreakers approached them in the guise of the Timebroker, a humanoid figure claiming to be a construct of their collective unconscious, and informed them they had become \"unhinged from time\", drawn away moments before a cataclysmic accident or death that would adversely affect their lives. The \"Timebroker\" further claimed that repairing damage to other worlds would eventually correct that done to their own lives, allowing them to return home. Upon agreeing, the group was presented with theTallus, a device that allowed them to jump between realities and that would help them discover their mission on each world.\nOn their first mission, the group (who came to call themselves the Exiles), were transported toEarth-1815, a world where Operation Zero Tolerance saw every mutant and super-human being either incarcerated or eliminated. Their mission: find their greatest leader. Most of the Exiles believed this to be this world'sCharles Xavier. However, upon freeing Xavier from a Zero Tolerance facility, he attacked them, freed a group ofX-Menand went on a rampage, mind wiping the entire population ofPhoenix,Arizonaand killing scores of others.[2]The Exiles, recognizing they'd made a grave error, realized this world'sMagnetowas the great leader they sought. While part of the team went to rescue Magneto and the other imprisoned super-humans, the rest clashed with Xavier and his murderous X-Men; Mimic slew Xavier whilst Magnus sacrificed his life to save everyone from a nuclear bomb set to go off in the Zero Tolerance prison. With their mission complete, the Exiles were given a new memberSunfireofEarth-2109and transported off to their next mission.[3]\nThe aftermath of their first mission had lasting effects, as The Timebreakers stored Magnus's body (and later, the bodies of all those fallen in battle) within the Panoptichron.[1]The Exiles' actions on Earth-1815 also caused that reality's version of theGrandmasterto lose a bet against theCollector, prompting him to learn what he could about them and concoct a suitable revenge.[4]\nThe next world the Exiles found themselves on wasEarth-8649a world that where theX-Menwere currently undergoing the Trail of the Phoenix. Their mission required them to kill that world's version ofJean Grey.[5]However despite some reluctance, the Exiles disguised themselves as members of theImperial Guardand succeeded in their mission with the help ofWolverine.[6]Brought toEarth-901237the Exiles assistedAlpha Flightin capturing theHulk, unaware they were being observed byWeapon X, another group the Timebreakers had gathered to take on missions too brutal for the more moralistic Exiles.[7]During this mission, Blink and Mimic began a romance, while T-Bird came to terms with himself after meeting hiscounterpart from that reality.[8]After a brief break,[9]the team embarked on a number of missions to:Earth-2318, where theSavage Landcovers two continents;Earth-20318, whereTony Starkwas President of the United States;Earth-23018, a world of Hulks;Earth-32081, where they battled theSpider-Demon;Earth-971023, reality containing some of theX-Babies; andEarth-39102home of theAntelope Men.[10]During these missions, Nocturne and T-Bird also began to form an intimate relationship.[11]The Exiles also spent another brief vacation onEarth-9212, where Morph realized Sunfire had no interest in a romance with him because she was lesbian; the two did become close friends, however.[12]\nTheir next mission brought the group toEarth-5692, where the alienSkrullshad conquered the Earth during the early 20th Century. Many of the group were captured and forced to battle against various super-humans in gladiatorial combat. Nocturne also realized she was pregnant with T-Bird's child.[10]Galactusthen arrived, prompting the Skrulls to flee the planet.[13]The Exiles gathered the super-humans of this world and worked together to defeat Galactus, but T-Bird was critically injured and left behind at the end of the mission, replaced bySasquatchofEarth-3470[14](unbeknownst to the team, the Timebreakers retrieved the injured T-Bird and placed him in the Panoptichron's stasis wall).[1]\nThe Exiles finally met their Weapon X counterparts onEarth-2600, leading to Blink's happy reunion with their leader, her mentorSabertoothfrom Earth-295. Though both teams collaborated to rescueDavid Richards, destined to be a mutant savior, from theSentinelsthat ruled his planet, things went awry when Weapon X was ordered to murder the boy, as he would enslave the world and the Exiles, unable to justify the murder of a young boy, clashed with Weapon X.[15]In the end, Sabertooth chose to stay behind and raise David, hoping his care would sway him from his dictatorial destiny, thus completing the mission and sending both teams onward to their next missions.[16]OnEarth-1016the Exiles grudgingly assistedDr. Doomin liberating his country from theSub-Mariner,[17]strongly affecting an increasingly embittered Mimic, who began to feel that the missions they undertook were stripping away his morals.[18]Soon after, during another break from missions, Nocturne unable to raise her child without its father, aborted it.[11]The Exiles next found themselves onEarth-21117, whereCurt Connorswas responsible for turning everyone on the western coast into a lizard-human hybrid, forcing the US to create a preserve for them. The Exiles prevented a cured Connors from wiping out his mistake, but Connors committed suicide as a result.[19]\nThe Exiles then found themselves temporarily derailed from their mission, pulled into theMojoverseby its rulerMojowho sought to force Morph back into his star actor.[20]With the aid ofLongshotthe team freed Morph and Nocturne and they were rescued by the Timebroker.[21]The Exiles' next mission was onEarth-8545, a world where a combination of theLegacyandTransmode Viruseshad created a deadly new breed of technorganic creatures calledVi-Lockswho conquered most of the world.[22]The group helped that world'sAvengersbattle the Vi-Locks and seek out a cure,[23]eventually summoning theAsgardiansof that reality and using their blood to create it. At mission's end the Timebroker told the group it was time for Blink to return home; she was replaced withMagikofEarth-4210, and Mimic became team leader.[24]In truth, Blink was not returned to Earth-295, but sent to Earth-2600 to assist Sabertooth in raising young David Richards.[25]\nMimic's tenure as leader was rough on the team; not only were they still reeling after the loss of Blink, but Magik was determined to complete missions by any means, even insubordination. On their first mission, they were transported toEarth-957145where Mimic was forced to kill the Juggernaut to save the people of Russia. OnEarth-989192the Exiles were supposed to stop theAvengersfrom defeatingMoses Magnum's attack on Japan, but upon discovering this would lead to the extermination of the entire island they became determined to stop Magnum instead.[26]However, despite the team's efforts, Magik disobeyed orders and confronted and murdered the Avengers, completing their mission and sending them on.[27]\nOn their next mission the Exiles were sent toEarth-616to defendCarter Ghazikhanianfrom theHavokofEarth-1298, who had possessed the body of hisEarth-616 counterpart.[28]This led to misunderstandings and a clash with this reality'sX-Menwho were already tangling withMaximus Loboand his wolf-mutants.[29]After explaining what was happening, the Exiles and X-Men teamed up to stop the evil Havok. Nocturne ended the battle by using her possession powers to shunt Havok-1298 into a dimensional void, where the Timebroker destroyed him.[30]\nThe Exiles then went on a string of missions complicated by Magik's reckless nature, among them a reality where she almost killed Moira MacTaggert, another where she crippled the Black Panther's son, and yet another where she caused the Morlock children to be lost, possibly forever. OnEarth-3931the Exiles were charged with trying to stop a team ofVampire Avengersfrom obtaining mystical totems to gain immortality. During their initial clash one of the vampires bit Sunfire, who began to turn.[31]The group enlisted the aid ofKen Crichton, the former Union Jack who retired after being disfigured byCaptain America; though he assisted in destroying the Vampire Avengers and restored Sunfire to normal, Crichton merely wanted to usurp Captain America's power for his own. Transforming into the Vampire King, he used his magic to disrupt the Exiles' teleport out of his reality;[32]this interference fractured the team and shunted them to various realities throughout the Multiverse.\nAs the nature of time varied between realities, each group spent a different length of time on each world. Sasquatch and Morph found themselves onEarth-9927being hunted by a version ofWolverineshortly after he was experimented on by the Weapon X program. Sasquatch was forced to kill Weapon X and come to terms with her killing the Logan of her own reality, where they were married.[33]Sunfire and Nocturne found themselves back on Earth-8545 where they assisted the Avengers in curing those still infected with the Vi-Lock virus. The pair spent two weeks in this reality, where Sunfire shared an ill advised romance withSpider-Womanbefore they were pulled back.[34]Magik only spent a short period in an ocean, while Mimic found himself onEarth-2942, a world completely taken over by theBrood. Mimic claimed that he was only on the Brood world for six months,[35]but was actually there for three years; he also concealed that he had been implanted with a Brood egg, which hisHealing Factorwas in the process of destroying.[36]\nThe group were transported to their next mission onEarth-312, where they were to witness the birth of theFantastic Four, with seemingly easy instructions: that nobody die. Although the newly created Fantastic Four were prevented from a fatal crash,Ben Grimmmutated into an even more monstrous form and began rampaging through New York.[35]The Exiles and Fantastic Four worked together to stop the rampaging Thing, while Morph andMr. Fantasticgathered a coalition of great scientific minds to build a device to restore Ben to normal. While they succeeded into restoring Ben to a more stable state of being, Mimic was seriously injured in the battle, causing the Brood embryo -- a queen -- to assert control of him and go on a rampage.[36]While the heroes battled the Brood-Mimic, Reed Richards and the other scientists created a formula to push Mimic's healing factor into overdrive, killing the Brood queen inside him. It was a success, but not before Sunfire was killed in battle trying to save bystanders. This created tension between Mimic and Morph who loved Sunfire, and thought Mimic to be irresponsible for not being truthful to the team. With Sunfire dead, the Exiles were surprised to find that Blink had been returned to them as a member of the team before they were teleported away.[37]\nAfter the Exiles took another vacation,[38]they were transported toEarth-4400. Tensions began to rise between the group due to Morph blaming Mimic for Sunfire's death, and Blink's reluctance to talk about her experiences back on Earth-2600. Here they were informed by the Timebroker that their counterparts in Weapon X had gone rogue since the inclusion ofHyperionfromEarth-4023, who had disobeyed the Timebroker's orders and sought to rule a suitable world as his own. The Exiles were informed that the two teams were going to be liquidated with the five surviving combatants continuing on with their mission.[39]During the ensuing clash, Weapon X lostSpider,Hulk,Firestarand the Exiles lost Magik when she betrayed the group to Hyperion, only to have her neck broken for her troubles, and proving to Hyperion that the Timebrokers were not sending any more recruits.[40]The remaining Exiles continued their battle against Weapon X with the help of their former leaderGambit. The Exiles won when Gambit willingly sacrificed himself, seemingly slaying Hyperion in the process. The Timebroker offered to send Morph back home, but Morph opted out, deciding to stay with the team instead.[41]The Exile's battle on Earth-4400 would have a lasting effect on the group. Hyperion, like all other Exile and Weapon X casualties, was placed in the stasis wall where, unknown to the Timebreakers, his body was healing and restoring him to life. He eventually broke free, took control of the Panoptichron, and forced the Timebreakers to assist in his revenge against the Exiles[1]while back on Earth-4400, Gambit's Tallus was found by young boy who would later grow up to be that reality'sNighthawk.[42]\nThe Exiles found themselves back on Earth-616 with a new teammate,Namoraand a cryptic message from the Tallus: \"Lose your possessions and earn your wings\". While the Exiles tried to puzzle over this, Namora refused to be apart and fled toAtlantiswhile the Exiles sought out the aid of the X-Men. Namora clashed with herEarth-616 counterpartwho easily defeated her and turned her over to theFantastic Four. The Exiles were informed of this just after meeting young X-Men studentBeak.[43]The team, not wanting their presence known yet, took Beak with them to rescue Namora, leading to a clash with the Fantastic Four.[44]However the battle is soon ended and explanations are made.Mr. Fantasticthen figures out the purpose of their mission: they are to leave Nocturne behind and take Beak with them on their mission. The Exiles found this to be true when they discovered that Beak had become unhinged from time and moved onward without Nocturne, who was then approached by theBrotherhood of Evil Mutants.[45]\nThe group next found themselves onEarth-14845where Morph single handedly stopped theImpossible Manwho had gone on a rampage.[46]The Exiles next were sent toEarth-5423where Blink was briefly replaced byMystiquewho learned of the Exiles' arrival fromDestinyand then tricked the group in assisting theBrotherhood of Evil Mutantsin breaking out their leader theBig M.[47]The Exiles exposed the ruse and saved Blink, and were surprised to realize that the \"Big M\" was this reality's version of Mimic. Upon seeing the good he could have done with his life after reading his counterpart's mind, the Big M surrendered and reformed, completing the Exiles' mission.[48]OnEarth-4162, the Exiles aided theFantastic Fourin assisting the Earth -- which was becoming a sentient planet thanks to the machinations ofEgo the Living Planet-- from becoming evil.[49]The Exiles assisted in this process, stopping interference from bothDr. Doomand Ego. During the battle, Blink was briefly in contact with theCelestials, who warned Blink of the Timebreaker and that he is not what she and her teammates think him to be.[50]In one of their stranger missions, the Exiles were ordered to purchase the last Danish from a pastry shop onEarth-26292. The group was teleported away immediately left to wonder what good they could have done, unaware that he purchase of the last Danish caused a chain reaction of events that prevented the Earth from being invaded by the Shi'ar.[51]\nThe Exiles next found themselves trapped onEarth-37072, a world transformed into a medieval world thanks to the magic ofKulan Gath, who was later usurped by the demonZarathos. Upon arrival on this world, the group was affected by the spell, being transformed into medieval peasants with no memory of their former lives or mission. They were then freed byMagikandSpider-Manof this reality who enlisted the Exiles in their quest to stop Zarathos.[52]During their assault on Zarathos' castle, Sasquatch found herself trapped in her human form of Heather Hudson and was ill with fever. The group attacked Zarathos head on and \"Spider-Man\" revealed himself to be Kulan Gath, who had tricked the heroes in assisting him in retrieving the Talisman that they gave him, and Zarathos after him, their power.[53]The Exiles won a victory when Heather gave in to to the spirit ofTanaraqthe Inuit god that granted her powers, who easily defeated Kulan Gath and completed the mission for the Exiles.[54]\nThe group was then brought toEarth-50358, where they were to stop a fuel cell factory from igniting the Earth's atmosphere. Not liking being manipulated, Tanaraq slew the workers and had the Exiles recruit brilliant super-villains to help him discover who the Timebroker is and how to get at him. The Exiles then sent Beak to collect theShamanwho then used his powers to summon theTanaraqof his world, who claimed the one possessing Heather Hudson an impostor and slew him, while Heather in turn was separated from Tanaraq. Heather was happy to be free and although she no longer had her Sasquatch powers she agreed to continue on with the team.[55]\nBy this time, Hyperion had full control of the Panoptichron and was using it to try to get his revenge against the Exiles.[1]He brought them to Earth-2600 where they found Sabertooth being hunted by the young mutants (now grown to young adults) he had charge of. Saving Sabertooth, the group then learned Blink's dark secret: during her tenure on Earth-2600 alongside Sabertooth, she helped him raise young David Richards, however David became evil as he was destined to and forced Blink to help him murder the last remaining humans on Earth before Sabertooth was forced to kill him. The Timebroker then tells Blink the team's mission but she refuses. Suddenly the Tallus is switched over to Sabertooth who tells the team that their mission is to kill Mimic. When everyone refuses, the Timebroker (really Hyperion) then punishes them, sending them off to a new world.[25]\nTo their surprise they found themselves on Blink and Sabertooth's native world of Earth-295 with Beak replaced with a new member: their old foeHolocaust, with the Timebroker ordering them that they must killMagneto. However when Holocaust discovered theM'kraan Crystalwas in the possession of the US military he  sought to have the Exiles help him use it to launch an attack on the Timebroker.[56]Recovering notes from one ofMr. Sinister's labs and a brief clash with this reality'sX-Men, the Exiles utilized notes taken on the crystal and the Tallus to transport themselves to the Panoptichron.[57]There, much to the Exiles' surprise, they found Hyperion waiting for them, and upon their arrival he quickly killed Holocaust.[58]While the Exiles battled Hyperion, the Timebreakers freed Beak from the stasis wall, believing him to be the only one who could save the Multiverse.[1]As the Exiles battled on, losing Namora and with both Morph and Mimic getting severely injured, Beak recruitedtwoHyperionsfrom Earths712and5764.[59]With the aid of the two Hyperions, the Exiles managed to defeat his evil counterpart and banish him to the dead world he left onEarth-4023. The two good Hyperions were then convinced by Beak to allow the Exiles to continue their work and returned to their native realities.[60]\nWith the battle with Hyperion over, the Exiles became determined to run their operation without the manipulations of the Timebreakers, with Heather working controls within the Crystal Palace. They then began seeing to their injured comrades, getting parahuman expertDr. StrangefromEarth-59661to assist in healing Morph and Mimic. In addition the team traveled toEarth-3752to obtain a copy ofCurt Connor's regeneration formula. However upon their arrival they inadvertently botched theScience Squad's attempt to forceKrakoato battleFin Fang Foom-- two monsters (or Kaiju) who were antigen and pathogen creatures that maintain the balance on this world.[61]While the Exiles were assisting the Science Squad, back at the Panoptichron (which the Exiles began referring to as the \"Crystal Palace\") Dr. Strange freed Weapon X'sDeadpoolin the hopes that his regenerative powers could be used by Mimic to heal himself. Deadpool killed Strange and then began freeing his fellow Weapon X teammates.[62]As the Exiles completed their mission on Earth-3752 and got a sample of Connor's regeneration formula, Mimic managed to copy Deadpool's healing factor and recover from his injuries and Deadpool's team-mate theHulkexecuted him for his murder of Strange. However as a side effect to Mimicking Deadpool's powers Mimic found his skin horribly scarred. They later had their team-mate Sunfire removed from the stasis wall and buried on Earth-8545.[63]\nThe Exiles next agreed to bring Beak back home to his native Earth-616, however their arrival occurred during a time that Earth-616 was briefly overlaid by theHouse of Mreality warp, briefly merging it withEarth-58163. Trying to make sense of the situation, Beak was shocked to learn that his girlfriendAngelwas a model in this new reality and that the mutant serial killerKevin MacTaggert(aka Mutant X, and Proteus) was on the loose.[64]With the aid of human fugitiveMoira MacTaggertthe team tracked down Proteus just as he took possession of Angel's body.[65]During the final clash, Proteus fled Angel's body and took aq of Mimic, then scanning the Tallus learned about the Exiles and the various alternate realities that exist and used his powers to jump to another world in search for a body that would not burn out. The Exiles went after him, leaving Beak behind to administer Curt Connor's restorative formula on Angel just as the Earth-616 reality returned to normal.[66]\nThus began the Exiles' trail to stop Proteus that took them to many different realities. After protecting themselves with metal implants to stave off Proteus, their first stop was toEarth-15731a world that was still in the 1980s and the super human population were referred to as Paranormals. There Proteus hoped to possess the body ofKenneth Connellwho wielded the powerfulStarbrand.[67]With the Exiles in pursuit, Proteus burned out Mimic's body and left it in favour ofJustice, a local hero, leading to another clash with the Exiles and Connell.[68]To get some edge, Heather Hudson made a deal with Mojo to recruit Longshot to their team in exchange for access to various realities. The now amnesiac Longshot assisted in defeating Proteus, but the villain managed to escape to another reality.[69]\nThe Exiles followed him toEarth-928, diverging it into a new reality:Earth-6375, a future world in the year 2099. There, Proteus sought to possess the body of theHulkcausing a clash drawing the attention ofSpider-Manand the world's megacorporations.[70]Through the course of the battle, Proteus found that Mimic's feelings for Blink had affected him and he once more fled, but not before exposing Spider-Man's secret identity for the whole world, forcing him to join the Exiles on their mission in order to prevent his foes from striking at him.[71]Proteus next arrived on Earth-712 and tricked theSquadron Supremethat the Exiles had turned corrupt before leaving the two teams to fight it out.[72]Put on a mock trial, the Exiles were able to clear their names and also help the Squadron expose theGlobal Directorateusing illegal means to take over the world. The Squadron agreed to let the Exiles continue their mission, but under the supervision of their team-matePower Princess.[73]\nThe Exiles continued their manhunt onEarth-9200a world where a super-powerful version of the Hulk known as theMaestroruled an irradiated world. The Exiles had the forethought to warn Maestro in advance and set a trap for Proteus.[74]However, when Maestro was accidentally injured by one of the Exiles he went into a rage and fought both parties. During the fight the metal strip in Morph's head was knocked out and Proteus -- having almost burned out his previous body -- then possessed Morph instead. To his surprise, Proteus realized that due to Morph's unique physiology the body would never burn out and then departed back to his home reality to get revenge.[74]However, Heather Hudson managed to use the Crystal Palace's computers to overshoot Proteus' return having him land on Earth-616'sCounter-Earth, a world nearly devastated by various global crises. There the Exiles teamed up with theYoung Alliesin preventing Proteus from using the world's nuclear stockpile to blow up the Earth under the supervision ofOrderandKaos.[75]The Exiles managed to defeat Proteus after he razed the city of Atlantis to the ground; hiding a modified B-Mod machine from Earth-712 they used it to put Kevin MacTaggert's personality into a state of dormancy and made him think he is Morph. The Exiles were then presented with a dilemma now: They now had to keep the multiverse's most powerful mass murderer under their control.[76]\nUpon their return back to the Crystal Palace, the Exiles then carried out the task of returning the dead and incapacitated former members of both the Exiles and Weapon X to their native worlds, all save for T-Bird whom they kept as they believed he might be revived someday. Blink made the difficult choice of returning Mimic to his home reality, turning down an offer to join that worlds'X-Menin favor of continuing on with the Exiles.[77]\nNow under full control of their operations, the Exiles became aware of a team ofExilesonEarth-33629whose membership consisted of alternate reality versions of the original team that had single handedly captured every super criminal on their Earth. Investigating, the Exiles fell into a trap set by the Grandmaster of Earth-1815 who had set it as part of a bet with hisEarth-33629 counterpart. After a brief clash both teams of Exiles learned the truth and when Grandmaster-1815 tried to renege on his bet, he was defeated by theElders of the Universeof Earth-33629.[4]Annoyed that the Exiles were not following their orders any more, the Timebreakers then tricked them into going to the home world of Heather Hudson, Earth-3470 where they assistedAlpha Flightin stopping theSoviet Super-Soldiersfrom unleashing the demonicChernobog. Once they completed their mission the Exiles were shocked to learn that they had been fired and then stranded on Earth-3470 by the Timebreakers.[78]\nThe Timebreakers then became aware ofEarth-127where theScarlet Warlockattempted to merge Wolverine's Adamantium skeleton toMagneto, however something went awry and Magneto was merged with the skeleton andMesmero, creating a new entity calling itselfBrother Mutantwho threatened to take over the entire world. Seeking new Exiles, the Timebreakers decided to select a team entirely of alternate reality versions ofWolverinehaving heard that he was the \"best there is at what he does\". However with each successive team sent, they were taken under the control of Brother Mutant who was mobilizing his army of Wolverines for a Mutant Massacre Tour. The last such team gathered included the older and wiserWolverineofEarth-811, youngJames HowletofEarth-1880(taking him on the night his powers first manifested), the Weapon X conditionedWolverineofEarth-520, thezombifiedWolverineofEarth-6195, and theWolverineofEarth-181(who still used his Patch identity), as well as the cyborgsAlbertandElsie-DeeofEarth-5211.[79]When their mission also began to turn out to be a failure, Wolverine-811 convinced the Timebreakers to recall the original Exiles who assisted the all-Wolverine team in defeating Brother Mutant, but not before Wolverine-811 and Albert seemingly perished in the battle. In the aftermath, the alternate Wolverines were all returned to their native realities and the Timebrokers allowed the Exiles to resume their mission.[80]\nThe Exiles next travelled to the world ofEarth-552, where theSilver Surferwas on a mad quest to destroyGalactus(who on this world revitalized worlds) for failing to save his homeworld ofZenn-La. The Exiles teamed up with theImperial Guardof this universe to defend Galactus.[81]The Exiles succeeded in their mission when Sabertooth agreed to take on a portion of thePower Cosmicand slew the Silver Surfer. Sabertooth then returned the power to Galactus, refusing his offer to be a herald in order to return with the Exiles.[82]The Exiles went on a series of successive missions saving 20 consecutive failing realities includingEarth-27536where they stopped theSinister Sixfrom slayingJ. Jonah Jameson,Earth-27537where they clashed with theSerpent Society, and theHellfire ClubofEarth-27538. In the latter mission the team experienced a close call when theWhite Queenalmost unleashed Morph's Proteus persona, prompting the Exiles to regularly use the B-Mod machine to insure that his Morph personality remains strong.[83]\nPower Princess, convinced that the Exiles have proved their worth, then left the team. Just as soon as she had left, the computers then pulledPsylockefrom Earth-616 to the Panoptichron under the command ofRomathe omniversal guardian.[84]After a brief clash with Sabertooth (mistaking him for his counterpart on her world) Psylocke agreed to join the team and they next went toEarth-1720where the Earth was under the control ofMadam Hydraand her army, whose only opposition was her former husbandReed RichardsandElektra.[85]There the majority of the team had been captured and brainwashed by Madam Hydra'sHandninja assassins and Psylocke had to face fears from her past battling this reality's version ofSlaymaster, who had blinded her in her home reality.[86]With the universe teetering on the brink of destruction the remaining Exiles managed to free their friends from Hydra control while Elektra freed Reed and Sue's daughterValeriafrom stasis.[87]When the universe appeared to be on the brink of collapse, Madam Hydra, her agents Slaymaster andWolverinethen fled using a reality jumping device created by Reed. Meanwhile, the Exiles freed the world's population -- which was held in stasis within a necklace worn by Valeria -- just in time to cause the universe to be reborn, however back at the Crystal Palace Heather believed her comrades were wiped from existence. Slaymaster, having failed to kill Psylocke then began travelling to world after world killing her alternate reality counterparts.[87]\nThe Exiles then spent the next six months helping rebuild Earth-1720 before returning to the Crystal Palace where they found the place deserted. A computer construct of Heather informed them that the Timebreakers abandoned the palace and Heather, thinking that her teammates had died, swept into a depression before leaving herself. The Exiles then went to tell Heather that they were alive and well and were surprised to find out that she was pregnant. After congratulating her, the Exiles resumed their missions, ending up onEarth-187319, leaving Psylocke behind at the Crystal Palace to run mission control due to the fact that she could not be detected by the Palace's computers. The Exiles found themselves on a world ruled byVictor von Doomand hisFour Fantasticswhose only opposition was theMole Man.[88]While Psylocke was visited by the \"Older Generation\" (a nice couple who claimed to be the original caretakers of the Panopticron) warning of a great battle coming, and the appearance ofCatherine Prydefrom an undisclosed reality, most of the Exiles sided with Von Doom, while Blink was captured by the the Mole Man who revealed that Doom used his science to create world peace but at the price of individual freedom.[89]While Blink recruited Morph and Longshot to her side, both Sabertooth and Spider-Man were seduced by theInvisible WomanandGwen Stacyallowing Doom to learn about their mission and plot an attempt to take over the Panoptichron.[90]While the Exiles fought Doom's forces, Psylocke and Cat fought off his troops at the Panoptichron with the aid of a revived T-Bird. In the end, Gwen gave up the will to live and died, devastating Spider-Man, while Doom was exposed, prompting every human being on Earth to die and the Mole Man to trigger a weapon to destroy the Earth, just as the Exiles attempted flee.[91]\nThe members of the Exiles were scattered to various other realities. Sabertooth ended up onEarth-797where he rescuedMystiqand recruited him to the Exiles. Likewise did Morph rescueRogueofEarth-1009. Blink ended up in a possible future where a member of the Older Generation showed Blink where her life might lead. As the Exiles were all pulled back to home one by one the group found Spider-Man onEarth-6375where he happily found love with that reality's version ofMary Jane Watsonand the Exiles thought it was better to leave him at that.[92]\nWith T-Bird recovered, the Exiles brought him to Earth-616 to be reunited with Nocturne whom they found among her teammates inExcaliburfollowing their victory over theShadow-Captains; this also was a reunion withDazzlerand Longshot, although Longshot had no memories of their past relationship. The two teams found themselves pulled into a war between Roma and her fatherMerlynwho had used the resurrectedMad Jim Jaspersto attack theCaptain Britain Corpsin a bid to retakeOtherworldand by extension the Omniverse.[93]WhileCaptain Britainwas injured by the first strike, the Exiles took Excalibur to their headquarters to heal him as Jaspers made his attack, converting fallen Corps members into an army ofFuryCybiots.[94]With Captain Britain needing medical assistance, the two teams enlisted the aid ofAlbionan alternate reality Captain Britain whom Excalibur previously defeated while the combined might of the Exiles and Excalibur battled Mad Jim Jaspers, who himself was turning into a Fury.[95]As the battle raged, Morph held his own against Jaspers, unknowingly utilizing his Proteus based powers to match his foe blow for blow. Meanwhile Longshot and Dazzler failed to stop Merlyn from fatally stabbing his daughter Roma.[96]With both Captain Britain and Albion battling Jasper's Fury, Roma transferred all her knowledge of the omniverse intoSagewhile the Exiles and Excalibur destroyed Jaspers. Psylocke battled against Merlyn, defeating him in battle, prompting him to flee while unknowingly being infected with the Fury virus. In the aftermath of the battle, the Old Generation were satisfied that the Exiles would take their place as guardians of the Omniverse. With his memories restored, Longshot left the team to return to Earth-616 with Dazzler, while Sage went along with the Exiles to make sense of the memories that Roma transferred into her mind and threatened to drive her mad.[97]\nUpon returning to the Crystal Palace, Blink and Sabertooth became aware of a crisis onEarth-91172where theHulk's Annihilation Wave threatened to wipe out all life. Realizing that their opportunity to prevent this catastrophe was delayed due to their \"World Tour\" and now busy with other matters, the pair decided to gather a new team ofExilesby sending that world'sKid Omegato gather heroes from other worlds. Kid Omega gathered Nighthawk of Earth-4400,Power Fistof Earth-8545,Spitfireof Earth-148611, andWild Childof Earth-295 to oppose the Hulk and his forces.[42]With this piece of business over with, Blink, Nocturne, and T-Bird decided to take a leave of absence from the group to spend time with Heather Hudson, leaving Sabertooth in charge of the group.[98]\nThese \"New\" Exiles then resumed where the original group left off. After getting acclimated  to their current situation and various conflicting emotions, they were geared up with new uniforms by Sabertooth.[99]Their first mission brought them toEarth-6706, a world that was devastated by meteors decades ago. There they protected theSub-Marinerand his wifeSue Stormfrom an assassination attempt by theBlack Pantherand herBloodforce. During this mission both Sabertooth and Psylocke fell in love with each other thanks to the manipulations of Bloodforce'sBloodwitch.[100]During the ongoing battle the pair almost betrayed their teammates due to Bloodwitch's control but they managed to fight the effects.[101]The Exiles assisted Namor and his family in fleeing to the Earth's moon colony before the Black Panther could seal off the Earth. In the aftermath of the battle they accepted Namor's sonGambitto join their ranks.[102]\nBack at base, Sage began to struggle with the many personalities that Roma implanted in her mind, chief among those a manifestation of her old Diana Fox persona, all vying for control over her body. Sage, Cat and Morph soon found themselves accidentally transported toEarth-8396, where Cat first began manifesting her ability to shapeshift into one of her alternate reality selves. There they found themselves in a world of modern technology, magic and dragons where they came to the aid of Prince Domenic and his lover the dragon Marysal. They learned that Dominic's parents had sent him to slay the dragon, disapproved of him loving it instead and hired the mercenary known asVengerto eliminate both the boy and dragon.[103]The trio of Exiles help defend Dominic and his lover, defeating Venger and proving to Dominic's parents that his love was true and to their surprise Marysal then transformed into a beautiful woman. Bare moments later the Exiles were returned to the Crystal Palace by their comrades, while Venger was recruited into Madame Hydra's army.[104]\nThe Exiles' next mission took them toEarth-80827where the world had not advanced beyond the Age of Empires with Britain still at war against France over control of the America, but also by the dictates of Atlantis. While the Exiles were busy preventing the assassination of the Queen of England and her son, Psylocke felt her Earth-80827 counterpart being slain by Slaymaster and was drawn to China, the scene of her death, while back at the Panoptichron, Cat analyzed data to learn that the Omniverse was dying.[105]While in China, Psylocke, now being influenced by the remains of her alternate self, agreed to be trained byOgunto battle Slaymaster. While back in America, the Exiles enlisted the aid of the Atlanteans and theEmma Frost'sForce-Xto fight off the French. Back at the Crystal Palace the destabilisation of the Omniverse destroyed the Heather Hudson computer simulacrum.[106]As the Exiles and Force-X continued to battle the French forces, Psylocke completed her training and bested Ogun in battle, having come to terms with the teeming alternate reality versions of herself that were effecting change in her.[107]Realizing that Ogun was in league with the French, Psylocke then defeated him again while her teammates succeeded in routing the French invaders, ending the invasion and completing their mission.[108]\nAs Cat desperately tried to find a means to prevent the Omniverse from collapsing, Sabertooth became aware of Slaymaster's killings of alternate reality versions of Psylocke. Sabertooth then traveled alone toEarth-4321to try and put a stop to it, resulting in a clash between Slaymaster, Madame Hydra and their forces. Before they could kill Sabertooth, he was saved by Cat who disobeyed his orders and phased him out of danger.[109]Tracked by Wolverine, Cat managed to phase off his claws, disarming him long enough for Sabertooth to slay him and allow the two Exiles to escape.[110]As Cat continued to try and find a means of saving the Omniverse, Sage continued to struggle with her conflicting personalities, and Psylocke continued her training for her ultimate confrontation with Slaymaster. When Morph returned from shopping for a new costume for Rogue, she tried to catch him off guard by tossing metal knives at him, unknowingly reawakening his Proteus persona before Sabertooth assigned the Exiles to a new mission. While the others were away, Sage was left behind to monitor things at base, and was once more attacked by Diana Fox and the other conflicting personalities in her head.[111]\nA team of Exiles consisting of Morph, Mystiq, Psylocke, Gambit and Rogue were dispatched back to Earth-1720 where theMad Makercreated hisChosen, beings empowered with fantastic abilities for his own amusement, includingThe Gold Goblin,Blood Skull,Black Baron Dormammu,Doom, andMagneta. The Exiles assistedRosetta Stoneand Valeria Richards. There the Exiles battled the Maker and his minions, until Morph's Proteus persona made itself known and attempted to destroy them. However, finding that Morph's consciousness was still alive and that he desired to do good instead of evil after experiencing true friendship both Proteus and Morph merged together defeating the Maker and his minions and restoring the regular order, and seemingly losing his Proteus powers in the process. Later when Valeria asked to join the Exiles on their mission, they flat out refused her, however she would not be so easily dissuaded.[112]\nThe Exiles next went toEarth-81114a world where the Earth is defended by the humanDaughters of the Dragonand theSaurianSons of Iron. There they came to the aid ofNerimania deposed Shi'ar empress who was being hunted by her sisterLilandrawho dispatched herShi'ar Death Commandosto slay her.[113]The Exiles teamed with the Daughters of the Dragon and the Sons of Iron to battle the Death Commandos, Cat's body shifting to alternate selves the whole time. However the battle took a turn for the worse when Madam Hydra and her minions arrived to assist Lilandra and eliminate the Exiles once and for all.[114]In the ensuing clash, Cat managed to slay Madam Hydra but at the cost of her own life, while Rogue and the Son of Iron known asColynbattled the Commandos and suddenly realized they had fallen in love with one another.[115]In the final battle, the Exiles defeated the last of Madam Hydra's legions and Lilandra's Commandos. Psylocke finally faced off against Slaymaster, defeating him in a battle, but refusing to slay him; her mercy allowed him to escape once more. With the Death Commandos defeated, the Exiles then forced Lilandra to surrender.[116]Meanwhile, at the Crystal Palace, Sage continued to battle Diana Fox and the other forces in her mind; however, when the powers that be proved too strong,[113]the two found themselves working together in order to survive.[114]With the odds against them, they still managed to hold their own until Merlyn returned to try and claim the knowledge inside Sage's mind.[115]In order to defeat Merlyn both Sage and Diana merged their essences together, their combined power apparently banishing Merlyn away forever.[116]\nAfter helping the people of Earth-81114 rebuild and mourning the loss of Cat, the Exiles prepared to return home only to learn that Rogue intended to stay behind with her new lover Colyn. Upon returning to the Crystal Palace they found that Sage had undergone a new change now that she had merged with Diana Fox and found new control; they also discovered that Valeria Richards of Earth-1720 managed to track them down and convinced Sabertooth to let her join the team. The group then went on a series of missions, going to:Earth-991, a world where the Vikings had settled in North America and clashed with the indigenous tribes; andEarth-1137, an Earth where sentient beings involved from insects and helped defend them from the Shi'ar. Soon after they were called back to Gambit's native world of Earth-6706 and learned of his father's death. With Namor dead, Gambit was forced to leave the team and assume his father's duties. Sabertooth and the others then returned to the Crystal Palace to face whatever new dangers threatened the Multiverse.[117]\nAfter an undisclosed period of time, the \"New\" Exiles found themselves trapped in the stasis wall due to their constant proximity to the Crystal Palace.[118]\nEventually, Blink, Heather and Nocturne returned to the Crystal Palace to find their friends trapped, and found themselves only able to free Morph. Realizing that a prolonged time in the Panoptichron meant becoming merged and trapped within it, the veteran Exiles decided to begin recruiting various groups to send out and constantly cycle out before this could happen.[118]To this end they rescued a number of mutants from various realities just moments before their deaths, recruitingPolarisfromEarth-8149,BeastfromEarth-763, thePantherfromEarth-1119,ForgeofEarth-2814, and theWitchofEarth-8823. With Blink posing as a new recruit and Morph working as the \"Timebroker\" this new team was quickly convinced they had no other choice but to help save the multiverse and dispatched them toEarth-90631where they were charged with preventingMagnetofrom bringing about the total annihilation of the Earth in retaliation for attacks on his nation ofGenosha.[119]This mission was made somewhat easier by the fact that Polaris and the Witch (both being daughters of Magneto) bothcounterpartsin this realityhelped them sneak into Magneto's fortress, but ultimately a fight broke out between the Exiles and Magneto's army of mutants.[120]The Exiles were captured but managed to break free and confront Magneto, removing his helmet and revealing to the telepaths among his loyal followers that he orchestrated the Sentinel attacks that led to his rise to power and eliminatedCharles Xavier, his chief rival. Despite this seeming success, the Exiles were informed that they failed their mission and were shunted off to the next reality they needed to fix.[121]\nThe group found themselves onEarth-10102where an all powerful version ofCerebroseemingly slew all the world's humans and took over the world leaving nothing but robots. The Exiles were soon assisted by Cerebro's confidants: theVision,Ultron, andMachine Man, who had secretly converted the Earth's population of humans into energy which was stored in Cerebro's robot body.[122]The Exiles then succeeded in shutting down Cerebro before it could catch onto their plan and help the robots restore humanity.[123]The Exiles were then sent back to Earth-90631 as it was discovered that it was the feud between that reality's Polaris and Scarlet Witch that would doom that world. They resolved that world by having the Witch pose as her Earth-90631 counterpart and exposeCyclops' psychic affair withEmma Frostprompting Emma to kill Scarlet Witch-90631. Having caught onto the fact that Blink knew more than they let on, the other Exiles had conspired together and had Forge construct a device that allowed them to use the Tallus to transport themselves back to the Crystal Palace. There they uncovered and were told Blink, Nocturne, Heather and Morph's plan. Their arrival also freed a female version of Kang who became trapped while trying to change her apocalyptic future, who further explained the nature of the Panoptichron: that it too undergoes changes as repair is done to the multiverse -- thus changing the nature of the guiding force gathering Exiles -- from the original insectoid \"Timebreakers\" to the \"Old Generation\" to herself. She then outfitted each of the Exiles with their own Tallus to prevent them from being trapped in the Panoptichron like the others and sent them off to continue their mission to save the Multiverse.[118]\nDuring a mission investigating a rift in timespace, Nocture, Sabretooth and Morph got lost and separated.[124]Not long afterwards, a creature called theTime-Eatermerged, and it devoured entire timelines faster than new ones could be created. As soon as he learned of the Time-Eater's existence theUnseenfromPrime Marvel Universeorchestrated the reformation of the Exiles. After being delivered the Tallus by a much younger version of himself, the Unseen used it to lure Blink to theBlue Area of the Moon, so she could use her experience of multiversal travelling to assemble a new incarnation of the Exiles and investigate the Time-Eater. Acting on its own volition, the Tallus teleported Blink to different realities so she could encounter specific inhabitants and make off with them at the last second before the Time-Eater consumed their timeline. This way Blink encounteredKhan, an olderMs. Marvelofa post-apocalyptic world,Iron Ladfroma timelinewhere he never traveled back in time to join theYoung Avengers,[125]Valkyriefroma realitywhere she was the sole defender ofAsgard, andWolvie, the Wolverine fromMojoworld'sAdorable X-Babies. The Tallus then transported Blink and the team back to the Prime Marvel Universe to report to the Unseen; however, theTribunal of Watchersappeared to punish him for breaking the vow of non-interference, and in the subsequent altercation the Tallus was shattered, sending the Exiles flying into thetimestream.[126]\nWith the Tallus' navigation systems damaged, the Exiles began jumping between universes. Inoneof these universes, Blink caught a glimpse of Morph.[127]During one of these jumps, the Tallus became displaced. On their way to find it, the Exiles joined forces with an anti-slavery pirate crew led by a version ofthe Thingalso known asBlackbeard. When the Exiles recovered the Tallus, it took them to thelunar headquartersof the Time-Eater. The evil creature turned out to be a version of Kang the Conqueror, who absorbed the power ofGalactusfromhis universe.[128]The end result gave him the ability to devour realities, which he intended to use to become the Multiverse itself. While confronting the Time-Eater, the Exiles were joined by a younger version ofNick Furywho had been pulled into Kang's palace while fighting the villain back in his home universe. Iron Lad deduced that bringing the Tallus back to when Blink reunited with it could reverse Kang's consumption of the Multiverse. Nick Fury took it to himself to deliver the Tallus to the Unseen, and Blink and Khan accompanied him through most of the journey of jumping through realities to travel back in time. In the process, the Time-Eater sent an army of Kangs to stop the Exiles, and Khan sacrificed herself to keep them at bay. After Fury successfully delivered the Tallus to the Unseen at the cost of his own life, Blink rallied an army of alternate versions of herself and many of the heroes the Exiles had encountered in this adventure, and returned to the Time-Eater's palace. The combined might of the heroes overpowered the Time-Eater and destroyed it. The damage caused to the Multiverse was reversed for the most part; however, when the Unseen reunited with the Exiles, he warned them their services would be needed to heal the Multiverse.[129]"

She decided to abandon her old costume and design a new one, as part of her \"rebirth.\" The newly designed gauntlets were described as shooting ropes and venom-sting bracelets.[2]\nIt has been stated by Natasha that at times each gauntlet has weighed four kilos, leading her to almost blow her own hand off on one occasion and that the parts were difficult to replace especially while in the field.[3]\nThe current gauntlets and the equipment it contains are upgraded and maintained byS.H.I.E.L.D.and the Widow, by being the owner, herself.

Despite being frustrated by his antics, by working together they managed to foil a bank robbery until they were attacked byLoki, who attempted to recruit Deadpool to a team of villains he was putting together. Sakura Spider was begrudgingly impressed when Deadpool's apparent bluff of having called theAvengersscared Loki away, and awestruck whenCaptain Americaarrived on the scene.[5]Speaking privately with Captain America, Haruka protested Deadpool's recruitment to Samurai Squad but was told that Wade Wilson's bizarre attitude was his way of coping with the grief of having lost everyone he cared about.[6]\nSakura Spider and Deadpool were dispatched to recruit the teenage idol-singerNeiro Aratabi, who was the host of asymbioteshe calledKage.[7]Chastising Deadpool not to do anything to embarrass her, Sakura Spider revealed she was a massive fan of Neiro and was accused of having a crush on her by Deadpool. After watching Neiro's performance, she and Deadpool unsuccessfully attempted to sneak past the security guards and were chased  outside. Spotting Neiro being attacked by Loki, Sakura Spider used her webbing to sling Deadpool at him before being subdued by the security guards.[8]\nTo Haruka's delight, Neiro joined the rest of Samurai Squad in protecting an interdimensional portal device fromHydraagents and a clone ofThanos.[9]Returning to base to prepare for the final battle against Loki and his army, Sakura Spider apologized for her early bad attitude towards Deadpool, but was stopped from asking him about his past by Neiro. Haruka was distraught when Neiro abruptly left the team to perform at a concert, and - reflecting on how her attitude towards Deadpool had changed - stepped out into traffic without paying attention and was promptly run over by a truck and a car, leaving her hospitalized.[6]Despite being unable to take part in the final battle, she rallied the Avengers to come to Deadpool's aid,[10]and he in turn expressed confidence that she would be able to handle any villains who tried to threaten Japan in the future.[11]"

Asking if he is meant to give an inner monologue toan audience, or if he is narrating pretending there's an audience out there, he relents and just introduces himself. OnEarth-60526in battle withDoctor Doom, he elaborates how he's the Spider-Man ofEarth-50101and is aware of other spider heroes across theMultiverse, but he is his Earth's Spidey and prefers that. Whenever he and the other Spiders partner up, everyone calls him the Spider-Man ofIndiaor some variation on that. Peeved that he's just an Indian Spider-Man to them, he makes an allegory on how Indians see Indian food as just food, accidentally making himself hungry. Jumping toEarth-1052, Spider-man fightsVenomasking why he does what he does and recalls hisUncle Bhim's words on great power. Also praising hisAunt Mayafor her community service, Spidey would help but his heroic responsibilities would preclude that. Fighting against theRhinoofEarth-84235, Spidey continues his inner monologue about his origin[1]and how it became an average Tuesday for him, thankful he at least remembered to bring a snack.

Jean is unsure herself as the owner is the Delvadian Ambassador,Anton Miguel Rodriquez, currently preoccupied with his dateFelicia Hardy, who Jean swears she'd hate if they weren't best friends. Anton comments that he'd have brought out the Spider Idol if it meant getting Felicia to be in his arms, but Felicia jokes that the idol isn't what is on display. Although Anton agrees but suggests their pairing amid the dance, he then asks why he feels like he isn't leading the dance, and Felicia answers that she was leading him to Jean DeWolff who'd been seeking a chance to talk to Anton. Despite Anton's desire for more togetherness, Felicia calls it off as she states to having plans, as she slips into her cat burglar gear. Having equipped a micro-transceiver to Anton's clothes and lifted a fingerprint off her gown sash, Felicia knew to dodge the infrared laser system Anton told to Jean, as she sought to steal the real Spider Idol hidden away.\nUnder breath, Felicia apologizes for sometimes feeling like the worst \"best friend\" but notes that Jean has mistaken Felicia's efforts to \"scratch her back\" as Jean unknowingly scratching Felicia's. Using the lifted fingerprint to enter the vault, the real idol bites her and she trips the alarm. When the NYPD find an empty vault, Felicia escapes with the idol questioning events and soon realizes her having Spider powers. The next night, Felicia sees Jean on the news call her \"Spider-Thief\" and doesn't like that, so after a reporter asks aboutWilson Fisk's concerns over hisclay tablet, Jean's acknowledging that she will be guarding it gives Felicia a \"challenge\" to accept. Donning a new look, Felicia dubs herselfNight-Spiderand infiltratesFisk Towerwith the ease of her new spider-sense, reaching the safe and ripping off the door to procure the tablet. At the precinct, Jean is infuriated that the thief was able to do the job on the very night their security went live, withCaptain George Stacytelling her it happened and orders she not let the thief continue to embarrass the NYPD. Over the following week, more heists occur and forensics locates unfamiliar prints on the ceilings and walls with notes left by Night-Spider at each scene. At the bar, Jean gets a call from Felicia who invites her over for a chat, but draws her weapon upon seeing the Spider Idol in Felicia's living room.\nDown the hallway into the master bedroom, Jean comes upon Felicia sitting upon the treasure trove of stolen items she'd attained the last week. A confounded Jean asks why Felicia did it and Felicia was a cat burglar for the thrill of it, which vanished once attaining hercursedspider powers. No longer finding thrill, she wants to give her friend the collar to at least make her somewhat happy and maybe get a new thrill escaping the world's best prisons. Jean is dismayed but still upholds her duty as police and cuffs Felicia, right before a web shaped portal opens just a few steps away asking for Felicia. Through the cosmic portal sitsArañaasking for Felicia's help in a completely \"hopeless\" cause as theSpider-Verseis in danger, needing Felicia to pull off the greatest heist in history. Sold at \"completely hopeless cause\", Felicia instantly escapes her cuffs to jump through while apologizing to an irate Jean and promising to bring her something nice. The now bemused Jean stands in the room alone with all the loot, uncertain by what happened and having no idea on what to write for her report.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nInTokyo,JapanonEarth-346,Hida Harukagoes about her normal day before acting asSakura Spiderafter school to stop a villain.

When crying in the rain, her mother reminded Haruka of her father's philosophy of great power and great responsibility, and she then chose to focus herself to inspiring others like her father did her.

Diagnosed with inoperable cancer, he underwentan experimental treatmentthat gave him superhuman regenerative abilities but caused the cancer to consume his entire body. Wade took on the costumed identity Deadpool, but when Vanessa was killed he was unable to save her and went insane from grief.[2]For a time, Deadpool was an infamously ruthless assassin, but mellowed into a still-violent but wisecracking antihero who used fourth-wall breaking humor as an outlet for his grief.[3][2]\nAt some point, Deadpool used a time machine to travel to feudal Japan, where he fought a samurai.[4]Some time later, Deadpool was invited to Tokyo by the Japanese multimedia corporation Shueisha, publisher of theShōnen Jumpmanga magazines. After foiling a terrorist organization's attempts to create a super-soldier serum, Deadpool was bribed into join theSamurai Squad- a new superhero team bankrolled by theAvengers- byIron Man.[5]Encountering the superheroSakura Spider- another recruit to the Samurai Squad, Deadpool mocked her for being a ripoff ofSpider-Man; though they worked together to foil a hostage situation.[1]Immediately afterwards, they were confronted byLoki, who offered Deadpool a spot on a supervillain team he was putting together. Deadpool refused and informed Loki the Avengers were en-route - Deadpool having RSVP'd them to a party celebrating the launch of theDeadpool: Samuraimanga - causing the god of lies to retreat. To Deadpool's dismay, however, the only Avenger to arrive wasCaptain America, who tasked them with finding new recruits for the Samurai Squad.\nDeadpool and Sakura Spider were sent to recruitNeiro Aratabi, a teenage idol singer who was the host of asymbioteshe'd nicknamedKage.[3]Attending one of Neiro's concerts, Deadpool teasingly accused Sakura Spider of having a crush on the idol. While attempting to sneak into the dressing room, Deadpool and Sakura Spider were accosted by security guards and chased outside, spotting Neiro being attacked by Loki. Spider Sakura used her webbing to launch Deadpool through the window, Deadpool tackling Loki in an attempt to disrupt his attempt to brainwash Neiro.[6]\nAttacked by the brainwashed Neiro, Deadpool was disgusted by Loki's accomplice, an obeseotakuwho had sided with the Asgardian when promised to have Neiro as a sex slave.[7]Deadpool managed to break Loki's control over Neiro and was disturbed when she asked him not to kill theotaku- who she said she forgave because he was one of her fans. Despite agreeing not to kill theotaku, Deadpool did so anyway when Sakura Spider arrived and recognized theotakuas a ticket-scalper.[8]AfterBruce Bannerremoved the control collar from Neiro, Deadpool annoyed him into Hulking out and was smashed into a bloody pulp.[9]Informed that Loki was after a machine that could create multiversal and even omniversal portals, Deadpool and the other Samurai Squad members were tasked with protecting it. A squad of Hydra insurgents brainwashed by attacked and were quickly subdued and/or slaughtered, the leader revealing that Loki had resurrectedThanosimmediately before the Mad Titan attacked, incapacitating Deadpool.[9]\nWith both the Hulk and Neiro effortlessly incapacitated by Thanos,[10]Neiro's symbiote bonded to Deadpool in a bid to increase their odds. However, even with the symbiote augmenting him Deadpool was easily defeated and it returned to Neiro. Deadpool attempted to contactCaptain Marvelbut accidentally summonedAll-Mightinstead. Deadpool was angered by All-Might defeating Thanos by himself, the villain destroying the interdimensional portal device with one last attack before succumbing to his wounds.[11]\nWith Loki rallying his army of supervillains on Mt. Fuji, Samurai Squad returned to base to resupply before the final battle. However, to Deadpool's annoyance, Neiro abruptly left after being notified that she had an upcoming concert, declaring she cared more about pleasing her fans than the fate of Japan. Distracted by thinking about how her opinion of him had changed, Sakura Spider was run over by a truck and a car, leaving her severely injured.[2]Forced to face Loki's army alone, Deadpool killed an avatar ofShuma-Gorathwith a super hero landing, but was easily defeated until several members of the Avengers arrived, having been called in by Sakura Spider.[12]Loki fled into Aokigahara Forest and opened a portal, attempting to summon a variant ofWeapon XI,[13]but he was killed by the villainousDeadpoolfromEarth-617, who Loki had previously hired. Deadpool-346 and Deadpool-617 fought, the latter attempting to kill him via impalement on a tree stump a laLogan, but Deadpool-346 convinced his counterpart to change sides by revealing that Iron Man paid better than Loki.[14]The two Deadpools defeated Loki, who revealed that the reason he wanted to destroy Japan was becauseThorhad stopped participating in their centuries-long rivalry due to becoming addicted to anime. As the Avengers arrested him, Loki declared that the villains of the world would rise up to complete his mission; Deadpool voicing confidence in the Samurai Squad's ability to take them down.[15]"

He eventually marriedMary Jane Watson[2]When MJ became pregnant with their firstdaughter, Peter relinquished the role of Spider-Man to his \"brother,\"Ben Reilly. Unfortunately, their daughter was born stillborn and Ben died in battle.[3]Years later, after theCivil Warwas averted, MJ gave birth to a healthy daughter namedAnnie.[4]\nSpider-Man was drafted into theSpider-Armyto battle theInheritors. During the invasion ofLoomworld, the Inheritors' base, Peter befriended aBlack-Suited Spider-ManfromEarth-939.[2]\nAlongside theSpider-Army\nAfter theMultiversewas destroyed byincursions, and recreated in the form ofBattleworld, Spider-Man and his family found themselves in a domain known as theRegency, fashioned from the remnants ofEarth-18119by the iron will ofGod Emperor Doom.\nWhen numerous superheroes started disappearing and numerous villains escaped fromRyker's, Peter was called in with a meeting with theAvengersto help defeat the threat, but he realized one of the potential escapees wasVenom, who would be coming after his family.\nSpider-Man swung to his apartment, where he found his family in Venom's grasp. When he engaged the symbiotic villain in battle, Mary Jane took their baby Annie out of the building, and decided to follow aFDNYfiretruck to a nearby building set ablaze, where she could be safe from Venom due to thesymbiote's weakness against fire. Venom soon followed Mary Jane to the building, but Spider-Man arrived just in time and forced the villain into the blazing building. Upon being notified the building had been evacuated, Spider-Man realized what he had to do to prevent Venom from coming back to endanger his family ever again, and collapsed the structure, seemingly causing Venom to be crushed and burned to death.\nPeter chooses to defend his family\nMeanwhile, the Avengers had unsuccessfully confrontedAugustus Roman, who had named himself the Regent. Roman had acquired the means to mimic the abilities of superheroes by harvesting genetic materials from their corpses after killing them. Regent killed the Avengers and the other heroes, leaving only Spider-Man, who wasn't present at the final battle. With the Regent having taken control over the domain by force, Peter decided to retire the mantle of Spider-Man to focus on protecting his family.[5]\nTo prevent their powers from being scanned, Peter and Annie usedinhibitor bracelets. The night before starting school, Annie's inhibitor broke down, and the next day she had to keep her powers down in hopes they wouldn't be noticed. After taking photos ofD-Man, who was protesting against the Regent's regime, being taken down byBoomerang,Shocker, andRhino, Peter headed to theDaily Bugle, where he overheard that the Regent's forces had found super-powered people in the same school,Public School 122 Mamie Fay. Using his hood as his only disguise, Peter jumped through the city and got to the school, where he found thePower Packfending off the Regent's goons. Spider-Man distracted the villains and allowed the kids to escape, while Mary Jane retrieved Annie. Back at the Regent's headquarters, he decided to unleash theSinister Sixto hunt down Spider-Man, now that he had resurfaced.[6]\nThe return of Spider-Man; back in black\nSpider-Man tried to buy power inhibitors from theTinkerer, but the latter alerted the Sinister Six, of whichDoctor Octopuscame to get Spider-Man. Spider-Man violently subdued Otto before the Sinister Six arrived to the scene, and were left only with the information that he had taken inhibitor chips.Kravendeduced he was trying to protect somebody by using the chips, for which he most likely had a family, specifically a child. Peter returned to his home and reconfigured the inhibitor chips for Annie, when the Regent made a television broadcast announcing a compulsory screening in Annie's school. When Peter, MJ, and Annie arrived to the building the following day, they were able to pass the scans; however, another kid,Lewis, was revealed to have powers, forcing Peter to jump into action as Spider-Man to defend the youngmutant. While he faced the rest of the Sinister Six,MockingbirdandProwler, who were disguised as Regent's agents, discovered Annie was the other powered kid, and abducted her and her mother.[7]\nSpider-Man finished dealing with the Sinister Six whenSandman, also working forS.H.I.E.L.D., tried to convince Parker to follow him. Peter doubted Sandman's word, which allowed enough time for the Regent to personally appear and subdue both of them. Meanwhile, Annie and MJ were introduced to S.H.I.E.L.D. and its leader,Hawkeye. While Spider-Man and Marko were brought to the Regent's headquarters,Dr. Johnny Ohnnworked at the resistance's base to reverse engineer Annie's inhibitor bracelet, and he created anarrow-headwhich could neutralize the Regent's powers, but first needed a DNA sample from him. The resistance's base was soon invaded by the Sinister Six after the Regent read Sandman's mind to learn of its location, and while S.H.I.E.L.D. used one of Ohnn's portals to escape, Annie jumped into action, helping to hold back the villains. Another portal was opened, which had been sewn into Sandman and Marko had activated it to let S.H.I.E.L.D. get into the Regent's stronghold. Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and Prowler entered it, and they were soon followed by MJ and Annie.[8]\nVs.Regent"

This led the United States government to introduce a \"Living Weapon of Mass Destruction\" registry for all super-powered individuals. Most heroes were divided on the issue, and aCivil Warensued.[1]\nThe Superhuman Registration Act had been a long time in the making. The logical extension of the often-proposed, never-passedMutant Registration Act, the Superhuman Registration Act arose following the devastating attack on Manhattan in reprisal forNick Fury's \"Secret War\"[2]and theHulk'sdestructive rampage inLas Vegas, which killed 26 adults, 2 children, and a dog[3](unbeknownst to the general public, theIlluminatisubsequentlydeceived the Hulk and jettisoned him into space following this incident).[4]\nFollowingM-Day, 90% of the Earth's mutant population found itself spontaneously depowered. With the mutant population suddenly far less visible and extremist groups claiming the event marked a turn in the tide of growing mutantdom (if not divine punishment against all mutants), sympathy for the group was near an all-time low. Many of the remaining mutants - estimated at first at198individuals - were gathered up and forced to relocate to theXavier Institutefor their own protection. These events put public support for the registration bill at around 50%.[5]\nTony Stark (Iron Man)was among those working to prevent passage of the act. He even hired a newTitanium Manto attack him immediately after his testimony before theCommission on Superhuman Activities, hoping it would hammer home that the act would make the nation less capable of dealing with rogue or foreign superhuman threats. The anti-registration camp seemed to be making headway, and may have even defeated the bill by the narrowest of margins, if not for the events that took place in Stamford, Connecticut.[6]\nVillainsNitro,Cobalt Man,Speedfreek, andColdhearthad been holed up in a house inStamfordwhen theNew Warriorslocated them. The Warriors were at the time the focus of a reality TV show, and although a number of them felt that the villains were out of their league, the network and others in the group thought it would be great for ratings. WhenNamoritaattempted to capture Nitro, he used his explosive powers and destroyed several city blocks, including the elementary school at the epicenter. All of the New Warriors, the three villains accompanying Nitro, and over 600 civilians, among them 60 school children, were killed. Numerous members of the superhero community arrived on the scene to search for survivors.[7]\nPublic sentiment towards superheroes plummeted. The inactive New Warriors were widely regarded as \"baby killers\" by association.Hindsight, desperate to distance himself from them, began releasing their secret identities, and almost as many were killed by lynching as by the explosion in Stamford. TheHuman Torch (Johnny Storm)was beaten into a coma outside a Manhattan nightclub. Public opinion had been lukewarm for the Superhuman Registration Act before; now it passed the tipping point. Although nominally a UN agency, S.H.I.E.L.D. seemed to have assumed the brunt of enforcing the act under acting directorMaria Hill.[8]\nCaptain America (Steve Rogers)balked at leading a force to apprehend rogue heroes. He felt that heroes needed to be above direct government control, because when politicians could control the heroes, they could decide who the villains were. When Cap refused to support the Superhuman Registration Act aboard theS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Hill attempted to arrest him. Yet, she had no right to do so, for the Act had not been passed yet, so Captain America was not yet a superhuman illegal combatant. So, Cap's actions in that case were in self-defense. After his escape, Cap began organizing other anti-registration heroes into a group the press dubbed the \"Secret Avengers.\" Most of his core group (Captain America,Hercules,Bill Foster,Luke Cage,Daredevil (Daniel Rand),Falcon, andCable) had to take on a series of identities to avoid capture, literally becoming outlaws. The Secret Avengers apprehended a number of criminals while evading the opposing heroes and the new S.H.I.E.L.D. \"cape-killer\" units. Other heroes joined them or were liberated after their arrests. TheYoung Avengers,Cloak, andDaggerwere some of these later heroes to join the group.[8]\nIron Man, on the other hand, felt that it was reasonable that heroes have proper training and oversight, that the casual self-policing the superhero community had enjoyed until now was insufficient, and (most importantly) that it was now impossible to resist this change in the political landscape. He gathered his own pro-registration heroes to bring inCaptain America's group and other non-registered combatants.Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), with the help ofYellowjacketand Tony Stark, began work on designing a prison (nicknamed42because it was the forty-second idea on Tony's list of ways to improve the world) to detain superpowered violators.[8]\nMost of the pro-registration heroes, such as Mister Fantastic,Doc Samson,She-Hulk (Jennifer Walters),Ms Marvel (Carol Danvers), andWonder Man, already had highly public identities. Even Stark unmasked himself as Iron Man (for the second time in his career), and admitted to previous attempts to hide his identity. One supporter, however, was not yet public:Spider-Manwas reluctant to reveal his identity. He prepared to liquidate his assets and flee the country with hiswifeandauntto avoid revealing his identity and putting them in jeopardy. They, on the other hand, were supportive and felt it was time for Peter to finally get some recognition for his good work. During a live, nationally televised broadcast, he pulled off his mask and announced, \"My name is Peter Parker, and I've been Spider-Man since I was fifteen years old.\"[9]\nCivil War combatants\nThe X-Men, on behalf of the mutant community, declared neutrality in the growing conflict. Acting leaderCyclopsfelt that the mutants had already been through too much during theDecimationto take a stand either way and survive. Individuals within the X-Men had their own opinions on the matter, however. Wolverine felt that the act was every bit as racist and oppressive as the Mutant Registration Act, while Bishop felt it was necessary to embrace the act and make sure that mutants could continue to self-police, lest the truly oppressive regime of hishome timelineshould come to pass. As the last known mutants, all members of the198andX-Menwere already in government databases and were registered by default when the act passed.[10][11]\nThe 198 have since chafed at the constantO*N*Esurveillance, as well as their inability to leave the school grounds without being tracked by monitoring chips. When it was discovered the chips could also deliver a powerful electric discharge to assure the 198 could be subdued, they rioted.Mister Mused his powers to remove the chips and they left the mansion.Bishop,Sabra, andMicromaxwere given permission to apprehend them, threatening to shatter Cyclops' neutrality. During the incident,General Lazer'sthinly veiled anti-mutant sentiments and his covert attempts to destroy them were uncovered. His neck was snapped byJohnny Dee(via his duplicate of the general) and the mutants and heroes rallied together to prevent disaster. The more sympathetic director of O*N*E,Val Cooper, now seems to have a free hand with regards to the mutant refugees.[12]\nThe X-Men and the 198 were not the only voices of the mutant community, however. The now mostly-depoweredMorlocksand the residents of New York's once entirely mutant ghettoMutant Townremained easy targets for hate groups now that they had reverted to more-or-less normal humans.X-Factor Investigations, an independent group of private investigators made up in part by members of the old superteamX-Factor, have recently set up shop in Mutant Town, and at times have been the only ones protecting the former mutants and putting down hate-induced riots. When the Registration Act passed, the group seemed uncertain how to react, and ultimately decided to go along with whatever their leader,Jamie Madrox, decided. Jamie, being one of the least decisive on the issue, was not happy to hear this. Initially conflicted, he happened to meet a fleeingAegis (Trey Rollins), who was being pursued by capekillers after stopping a purse-snatcher. After helping Aegis escape, Madrox made up his mind and called a press conference to inform everyone that Mutant Town was now officially off-limits. From now on, they would protect its residents, and the capekillers' presence would not be tolerated.\nInto this chaotic scene comes Pietro Maximoff. The man once known asQuicksilverhad lost his speed powers during the Decimation event, but had gained new powers by inhaling theInhumans'Terrigen Mists. He now has the ability to restore lost powers to former mutants, though doing so usually ended badly for the recipient of his \"gift\". He has also set up shop in Mutant Town, though the full extent of his activities has not yet been revealed.\nMeanwhile,Wolverinehad begun tracking down Nitro the moment rescue efforts ceased. He was able to track Nitro's scent and determine he had skipped town hidden on a pick-up. Interrogating the driver, Wolverine then found Nitro hiding in a cabin in the woods. By this time S.H.I.E.L.D. had also intervened, and a team including Wolverine was sent to capture him. Predictably, he incinerated everything within a wide radius of the cabin. The agents died, and Wolverine was reduced to (seemingly) nothing more than anAdamantium-plated skeleton. It was while he was regenerating that he heard Nitro talking to a contact over the phone, informing him of the latest kill. The conversation went sour: Nitro's use ofMutant Growth Hormoneto enhance his power was mentioned, as was the fact that he was now officially too hot to be useful. Finally regenerated, Wolverine went toe-to-toe with Nitro, taking advantage of the small radius of safety around his body that prevents Nitro from incinerating himself or anything on his person.\nThe fight was interrupted by a trio ofAtlanteansbefore Wolverine could kill Nitro. The Atlanteans sought to bring Nitro back toAtlantis, where he was wanted by PrinceNamorfor the murder of his cousin,Namorita. Wolverine fought with them, then joined them to go to Atlantis to confront Namor personally. During the course of debate over what to do with Nitro, the villain freed himself and tried to take an Atlantean woman hostage. Wolverine subdued him, cutting off his hand in the process. He then decided to leave Nitro to Atlantean justice, and focus instead on the ones who supplied him with MGH. He eventually determined the distributor was the corrupt head ofDamage Control, a firm that took clean-up and rebuilding contracts following superhuman fights. It didn't take much detective work to determine that more powerful villains meant bigger fights, and bigger contracts.[13]\nMeanwhile the government recognized that a war between superheroes left the country defenseless against the remaining super-villains. Their fears are well-placed: villains such asDoctor Doom,Red Skull,Arnim Zola, theMad Thinkerand thePuppet Masterhave all been shown to have insidious plans in the works. The Thunderbolts were asked to spearheadOperation: Justice Like Lightning, in which they would confront, capture, and if possible reform super-villains. Little did anyone outside theThunderboltssuspect thatHelmut Zemohad already been collecting super-villains for an army to confront the mounting threat of theGrandmasterand his newSquadron Sinister![14]The captured villains willing to play along quickly swelled the team into three large squads. Still more are being trained every day in a secret mountain camp.  Numerous other villains have been released since then under more direct (or less legitimate) government supervision, including theGreen Goblin, theVulture, theJester, andJack O'Lantern. The villains are supposedly kept in check by nanites in their blood stream which can monitor and disable them at any time. Norman Osborn, however, has learned the secret to deactivating them from a mysterious benefactor.[15]\nMost villains sought to bypass the act. Crime mistressRicadonnaallowed some supervillains to escape the act by graftingSkrulltissue into their bodies in exchange for freeing her from prison. The survivors of the experiment:Ferocia,Kingsize,Flameand a newBlue Streakgained shape-shifting abilities, making registration easy to avoid. She later underwent the same process herself. FormerMaggiamemberHammerhead, on the other hand, saw the act as an opportunity to usurpWilson Fiskas the Kingpin of Crime by rallying criminals (consisting of the Ani-Men V, Answer, Aura, Bloodshed, Clown, Cyclone III, Discus, Electro, Great Gambonnos, Kangaroo II, Man Mountain Marko, Mauler, Mindblast, Override, Ringmaster, Stiletto, Spot, Squid, Trapster, and Will O' The Wisp) in opposition of the act. His reasoning was that it was only a matter of time before every super-being was treated as a walking WMD, and then the criminals among them were as good as dead. A number of super-criminals did in fact rally under him, but the Kingpin managed to orchestrate the capture and death of his rival from his jail cell. He deceived Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. into believing they were raiding Captain America's secret headquarters, while his double agent under Hammerhead,Underworld, made sure the usurper did not survive.[16]\nThe criminal namedThe Hoodalso took advantage of the split in the superhero community by creating his own criminal syndicate and attempted to gain influence in the criminal underworld.\nDr. Strange during Civil War\nConflict among the heroes was constant, with the government-backed heroes tracking down unregistered super-humans (and subsequently arresting or registering them) and trying to find Captain America's Secret Avengers. The Secret Avengers operated out of a series of secret safe houses set up by Nick Fury, kept secret from everyone within S.H.I.E.L.D.. Cap's team continued to apprehend super-villains (usually leaving them bound for the authorities), and launched a series of well-coordinated attacks on prison transports carrying unregistered super humans. During one such raid, the convoy was diverted when Iron Man became aware of Cap's plan, and ended up going directly downYancy Street, a hotbed of civilian opposition to the Act. TheThing, who was only visiting his old neighborhood, got roped into crowd control. When a young member of theYancy Street Gangnamed Cee died in the riot, Grimm became so disgusted with both sides that he left the country for France (As a patriotic American he could not act against the law, but as he felt the law was wrong, he could not support it either). Incidentally, the US government made it very difficult for Grimm to get out of the country. His assets were frozen (too much money to risk going untaxed), his baggage was held up (even shampoo could be a potential bomb), and he was lucky to board before he was added to the national \"no-fly\" list. He took up withthe Heroes of Paris.[17]\nIn Los Angeles, theRunaways, unaware of the situation, stopped the Flag-Smasher in public, and was chased out by S.H.I.E.L.D., with their agents severely damaging cyborg member Victor. In New York, the Young Avengers see the fight on TV and the Vision suffers a seizure. Despite Captain America's veto of the plan, the Young Avengers steal a Quinjet and track down the Runaways. After a brief fight, the two teams are attacked by Noh-Varr, who was sent by S.H.I.E.L.D. to take them down. Noh-Varr breaks Xavin's neck and steals Hulkling, Wiccan, and Karolina, taking them back to his prison in the Cube. During the fight, the Vision phase-shifted his hand into Noh-Varr's chest, who broke it off to escape. The remaining members of both teams broke into the Cube and saved their teammates, freeing Noh-Varr from the mind control of the Cube's warden. The Runaways refuse to pick a side in the war and maintain a neutral stance.[18]\nThe Secret Avengers were lured by a false emergency call into an ambush by the pro-registration forces, in an attempt by Iron Man to talk the conflict out. However, Captain America attacked Stark, leading to a direct confrontation between the two sides. They first attempted to disable Cap and his team with sonics, but as the battle began to turn decided to unleash the secretiveProject: Lightning:Thor. After the fight, it was soon revealed that this was not the true Thor, but a clone created from a few strands of Thor's hair and empowered by a technological copy of the recently-returnedMjolnir. The return of the long-missing god among them gave everyone pause, but the battle soon raged on. When confronted byBill Foster, Thor sent a bolt of lightning through the hero's chest, killing him. With both sides in shock, Cap ordered a retreat. Bill Foster's tragic death dramatically changed the way both sides looked at the conflict, and turned it into a true Civil War. The event shook up both sides in the war, withStatureandNighthawkfinally surrendering and registering, while the Human Torch andInvisible Womandecided to oppose the act's enforcement with Captain America.[19]\nThe pro-registration side suffered another blow when Spider-Man became curious about many of the details of enforcement. He came to realize that Stark was using the \"Iron Spidey\" suit to monitor his actions and reactions, including his spider-sense. He found and added override codes for a number of Stark commands designed to subdue the wall-crawler if necessary. At one point, he accompanied Stark on a visit to42after Sue and Johnny left to join the Avengers. He learned that many of the most powerful captured super-humans were being held without trial and without access to counsel in an enormous super-prison within the life-drainingNegative Zone. Spider-Man rebelled against the act, and was attacked by Iron Man when he tried to sneak away with Aunt May and Mary Jane. During the fight the three escaped, and several \"ex\"-villains were sent to capture him. Already weak, he was found, drugged, and blasted half to death by Jack O'Lantern and the Jester. He was saved at the last minute by thePunisher, who brought him to Captain America. Castle revealed he hadn't cared much about the superhero's little war until the government started using killers likeBullseyeandVenom. Now he was determined to take down the scum, anyone supporting them, and anyone in his way. The Avengers knew the Punisher's skills were exactly what they needed to wage their guerrilla war, but also that accepting the convicted killer into their ranks destroyed almost all of their legitimacy and moral high-ground. Later, Spider-Man would interrupt a news cast to make a public statement about the horrors of the act's enforcement, and pledged to fight it.[20]\nFollowing the incident, the US government tried to discreditCable, who was seen as a risk even before he allied himself with the anti-registration camp. Cable opposes the registration act because he sees it as the first step towards government-sponsored superteams, then towards a super-powered police force that will ultimately lead to a global police state. Like Bishop, his concern for the future is driven by a knowledge ofhis timeline'spast. For the past few years, Cable had been promoting his island-nation ofProvidenceas an intellectual Utopia of peace, cooperation, and advance technology. When Cable recently over-threw theFlag-Smasheras president of the troubled nation ofRumekistan(with the help of the popular resistance), many in the greater world became convinced the would-be mutant messiah was a threat to international stability. The mercenary groupSix Pack(which paradoxically included the very anti-registrationSoloand Cable's pro-registration, sometimes-friendDeadpool) was sent to disrupt the Rumekistan power grid as part of a larger plan to discredit Cable. The plot was thwarted, and exposed before the international community.[21]\nAn ambassador from the kingdom ofAtlantis, on a mission of peace backed by the European Community (represented at the event by theSuper Heroes of Europe), was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt. Norman Osborn, bearing an obviously fake press pass and handgun (and none of his Green Goblin paraphernalia), fired once at the statesman, hitting him the shoulder. The ambassador was escorted back to the ocean by his people, and Osborn immediately collapsed to the ground claiming he was framed. Police later recognized that an accomplished menace like Osborn could have easily killed the ambassador, and that the events leading up to the shooting just did not make sense. Osborn attempted to tell police that his actions were being controlled by a third party through the nanites, but was unable. He was turned over to the federal government before NYPD could learn much. Following the attack, Atlantis has massed their troops and vessels along the United States' east coast, as if preparing to attack.[22]\nThe US is also still in the midst of a cold war with theInhumansofAttilanover their refusal to return stolenTerrigen Crystals. Since the now-deceased General Lazer has the first and last word on the matter, it's still not clear if the US government even knew Lazer had taken possession of the crystals originally stolen byPietro Maximoff. Unaware of the war footing, theSentryrecently traveled to Atillan, where he was at first attacked, then brought before the royal family. Informing the Inhuman royal court of his hidden past, theSecret War,House of M,Decimation, and Civil War, many of the Inhumans were moved to tears at the tragedy of it all. When Iron Man came to retrieve Reynolds, he was informed that this war would not be allowed to come to their land again, or else the cold war between their peoples would heat up very quickly.[23]\nIt should also be noted that the visit by the Super Heroes of Europe underscored the fact that no one has really decided how the act applies to foreign superheroes, though several super-villains of foreign origin are already being held based on previous convictions. Though not involved in the Civil War directly, relations with Wakanda and its super-powered monarchs, theBlack Panther (T'Challa)andStorm, have also been strained lately. It now seems inevitable that the Civil War will spill beyond the US' borders.[24]\nPublic interest peaked whenSpeedballwas found alive, hurled a state away by the force of the Stamford blast. Robbie seemed to have lost his powers in the blast (the explanation being that his powers protected him from the sudden force, but burned out their biological mechanisms in the process). He was held without trial in a foreign country for a time, but was eventually relocated and given counsel in the form of Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk), who attempted to argue he was unconscious when the act was passed, and thus never had the chance to register. Instead of following her advice, he refused to register. Having no more powers, he was put in the prison's general populace, where he was regarded by the rest of the prisoners as a \"baby killer\" and beaten regularly. Hoping to set an example for those who would attack him, he challenged the meanest detractor to a boxing match. He was in the middle of getting pummeled in the ring when his powers kicked in, destroying the ring and knocking out everyone in the near vicinity. He was again put in solitary, where he learned his parents never wanted to see him again. He jumped at the chance to testify before Congress on the Stamford incident, but was shot as he was being escorted to chambers. As he was bleeding to death in the ambulance, his powers again activated with enough force to hurt even She-Hulk. He was mended through Reed Richards quick action, but returned to prison once better. This time imprisoned at theRaftsuper-prison, he was used as the focus of an escape opportunity by a group of supervillains (Razorfist,Crimson Cowl, andDiamondheadin particular). They distracted the guards long enough to take Baldwin hostage, then killed the guards while Justine Hammer opened the gates. With Baldwin being used as a human shield, he was again able to activate his powers, this time intentionally, burning many of the escapees beyond recognition. Having seemingly undergone a major and spontaneous and violent personality change, he is now anxious to register and get back out into the world.[25]\nTrying to navigate this entire sordid affair were reportersSally FloydandBen Urich. Sally started out as one of the most vocal opponents of the act in the press, immediately decrying it as violation of civil liberties. Her opinion was not altered much by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s constant surveillance, nor her recent arrest after she attended a meeting of unregistered heroes. However, after she was bailed out bySenator Sykes, one of the authors of the registration act and a frequent target of her opinion pieces, she began to realize that he too was concerned with American civil liberties, and that she hadn't given the issue the full consideration expected of a good reporter. After a disappointing interview with Captain America, Sally found herself more conflicted than ever. Ben Urich, on the other hand, had been mostly quiet on the act itself, but had slowly been cataloging inconsistencies as he researches fires, murders, and attacks on himself. He wondered if Norman Osborn was really being monitored, who attacked him dressed as the Green Goblin, why would the Goblin attack a group of Atlanteans, and what were the Atlanteans doing hiding in a New York warehouse. From the shooting of Robbie Baldwin to the shooting of the Atlantean ambassador, the more evidence he gathered, the more the missing pieces spoke of a conspiracy.[26]\nAnti-Reg forces sneak attack\nAs the Punisher worked his way through theBaxter Buildingto retrieve plans for File 42, Sue Storm went toAtlantisto persuadeNamorto join the Secret Avengers, but to no avail. The super-villainsGoldbugandPlundererarrived at the Secret Avengers' base to join Captain America's team, but the Punisher immediately killed them, calling them killers and thieves after their deaths, leading Captain America to attack him and kick him out of the group once he did not raise a finger against him. The Secret Avengers, joined by Storm and the Black Panther, reach the Ryker's Island penitentiary and head through the portal to the 42 complex, but the team is confronted by the pro-registration supporters, revealing each team had placed a spy on the other.Hulklingis able to release the incarcerated heroes from the cells of the 42 complex through the guise ofHenry Pym, making the odds more even. As the battle is about to commence, Captain America warns the pro-registration heroes: \"Now close your eyes, gentlemen. This might hurt.\"[27]\n\"Thor\" vs. Hercules\nAs the battle began in the Negative Zone, Cloak moved the battle to the center of New York City. Namor and an army of Atlanteans join the battle alongside the Secret Avengers, followed by the Thor clone andCaptain Marvelon the pro-registration side. Vision disrupts Iron Man's armor and Captain America is able to subdue him. On the battlefield, Mr. Fantastic is shot while trying to save the Invisible Woman from theTaskmasterand Hercules crushes the skull of the Thor clone. As the battle rages on, the city is badly damaged. Thing returns to protect the citizens from harm of the battle. Captain America's side seems victorious as Iron Man lays on the ground waiting for Cap's finishing blow. Just before Cap can hit Iron Man, several standard cops, EMTs, and firefighters hold him back, and Cap realizes how much damage the fighting has caused to the general population that they all want to protect. Wishing to avert anymore unnecessary bloodshed, Cap surrenders and the team follows suit, with many of the Secret Avengers given amnesty by the government while Captain America is placed in jail.[28]\nTwo weeks later, the50-State Initiativewas officially launched and theMighty Avengersassemble as a team. Tony Stark was appointed Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Maria Hill is demoted to deputy status. Some heroes chose to move to Canada, while some stay underground, such as the New Avengers. In front of his New Avengers teammates Luke Cage and Doctor Strange, Spider-Man sorrowfully donned his black costume.[28]\nUltimate Civil War: Spider-Ham\n\nAlternate Civil War\nA reality similar toEarth-616, whereas itsSpider-Manwas killed by Karn during theCivil War.[29]\n\nAnnihilation Reached Earth\nUnlike the event'sEarth-616counterpart,Matt MurdockofEarth-14026participated in this event as well.\n\nMarvel: Ultimate Alliance\nThe story begins with the superheroes waging an unsanctioned attack on Castle Doom, Latveria due to the fact that the prime minister, Lucia Von Bardas, markets technology to the Tinkerer, who, in turn, markets them to supervillains in order to upgrade their suits. The President refuses to attack Latveria due to the fact that Bardas has established friendly relations with the American government. The attack on Latveria is successful, ending with Fury's squadron destroying Castle Doom, and Bardas being presumed to be dead.\nOne year later, Ms. Marvel is reported to be missing after being sent to recover intel on criminal activity. A team is sent to rescue her, and find her interrogated by the Shocker. They then discover that a cyborg Von Bardas has been leading Latveria in an assault on America for the attack on Latveria. Her plan is thwarted by the heroes, however, in the process, a portion of the city has been destroyed, causing the government to consider enacting the Superhuman Registration Act. Nick Fury disappears in light of the incident, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill is appointed to be the new director. In a television broadcast of The New Warriors, the supervillain Nitro creates a massive explosion, killing over 600 lives and causing the Superhuman Registration Act to be enacted. Captain America, in disagreement of the Act, rebels and forms a team of his own in order to battle those who support the Act. Another team is formed, led by Iron Man, in order to restore peace and thwart Captain America's rebellion. The story then is split into two separate branches depending on player choice: Pro-Registration and Anti-Registration.\nThe Pro-Registration then creates nanite technology which is used to control the minds of supervillains, aiding them in their quest to defeat Captain America. The two plotlines converge when the Pro-Registration team leads the Anti-Registration team to a chemical plant. Iron Man attempts to negotiate with Captain America, promising amnesty for the Anti-Registration team, but the Captain refuses, resulting in a battle between the two factions. The nanite-controlled villains, however, go haywire and plant bombs all over the chemical plant. Nick Fury returns to the plotline as he tries to defuse the explosives. As the final bomb is about to be defused, however, Venom thwarts Fury's intentions, causing an explosion which incapacitates the heroes. They are brought to a safe house by Nick, who unites the teams in order to defeat the out-of-control villains.\nThe heroes travel to the Negative Zone in order to bring samples of the nanite formula. The mission is a success and the team escapes, however, Fury's fate is unknown, as he was left behind right after he activated a self-destruct system. The Registration Act, as a result, is suspended, after it is revealed that the nanites have survived and have spread throughout the world. The reunited teams are then split into various groups, with the main group heading to the Black Panther's home, Wakanda. They defeat nanite-controlled agents, and it is revealed that the nanites are now under the control of the group known as The Fold. The team then also discover that Nick Fury has been taken over by the Fold. The groups then establish a base in Wakanda, as the country is safe from the nanite invasion. The team then travel to Iceland, a destination which contains a base under the Fold's control. They then transmit a signal which paralyzes the nanite-controlled villains and heroes, allowing them to be cured. The team then battle the Tinkerer, who is the ringleader of the Fold, and defeat him. However, the battle has not yet been won; a nanite-controlled Nick Fury then battles the heroes, ending with the heroes victorious.\nThe end of the game is then determined on which faction the player chose; if the Pro-Registration team has been chosen, the Superhuman Registration Act is amended, whereas if the Anti-Registration team has been chosen, the Superhuman Registration Act is repealed.[30]\n\n"

Despite his young age, he was similar to his grandfather, being a cold, calculating, and relentless CEO. After seeing the Spider-Family, he became fascinated with the daughter,Spiderling. He was taken care of by hismother's assistant,Miss January, who reported to Liz on Normie's behavior.[2]Liz tried her best to make sure that Normie doesn't follow in his father and grandfather's footsteps, however, Ms January manipulated Normie, making him blame the Spider-Family for the death of his father and driving him to construct a Goblin-Mech in order to bring them down. January coerced Normie and began piloting the mech so she could avenge Harry. Normie assisted Spiderling in destroying the mech from the inside. Afterward he thanked her for helping him get his life back and the two remained friends.[3]\nThey continued being friends, but as time passed they started to meet each other less, even though he now had a normal life as CEO.

His was still targeted by enemies of the Osborns, but thankfully to Spiderling protected Normie from these attacks. He was determined to redeem the Osborn name, but unbeknownst to him, the lead scientist at his company was secretlyMister Sinister, who used this resource to create clones ofSpider-Manin order to use them to attack theX-Men. Normie used some goblin tech to assist the Spider-Family and the X-Men in defeating Sinister, but his exposure to Sinister's chemicals caused Normie to grow four additional arms.[4]"

        "content": "Adam KubertGalleryNameAdam KubertPersonal InformationGenderMaleDate of BirthOctober 6,1959Place of BirthU.S.A.,New Jersey,BoontonProfessional InformationEmployersMarvel Comics;DC;Dark HorseTitlesWriter,Penciler,Inker,Cover ArtistFirst WorkUnknown\nMister Sinister by Adam Kubert\nAdam graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a degree in medical illustration. He also attended the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art in Dover, New Jersey, from which he duly graduated and has since become one of the industry's leading professional comic book artists.\nAdam Kubert has publicly expressed admiration for the works ofFrank Miller,Will Eisner,Jim Steranko,Alex Tothand his father Joe Kubert. Much of the inspiration for Kubert's 'painted' work, as seen on the covers of his Action Comics run, are drawn from the works of Will Eisner as can be seen by the brown almost 'sepia' like finishes with the white highlights. The definitiveWolverineandSabretoothbattle (Wolverine, Vol.1, Issue 90) featured multiple gate-fold interior pages, a throwback to Steranko's work on the 'Nick Fury: Agent of Shield' comic.\nHe is probably best-known for his work atMarvel Comics, in particular for a  sporadic run on the soloWolverinetitle with writerLarry Hama, a short run with writerPeter Davidon theIncredible Hulkand numerous stints on variousX-Mentitles. Adam Kubert's trademark is his raw, dynamic art style, combined with fluid storytelling and noteworthy pacing. He's also known for his experimentation in art style and storytelling, being one of the first mainstream (i.e. Marvel or DC employed) comic book artist to experiment with the pencils-straight-to-colour approach with Steve Bucellato onThe Incredible Hulk. On his X-Men run, Kubert was teamed up with European colourist Richard Isanove who subsequently followed Adam to theUltimate X-Men, perfecting the pencils-to-colour approach along the way, as can be seen on the majority ofUltimate X-Mencovers as well asWolverine:Origin. Adam Kubert has oft been criticized for his inability to turn out a comic book (22 pages) on a monthly schedule, often requiring fill in artists, a penchant that Kubert himself has admitted to. In response, in a 1998 Wizard interview with Jim McClaughlin, Kubert somewhat apologized to fans for his inability to complete his books on a monthly basis (and as compared to artists of the previous decades who could consistently produce monthly titles e.g. his father Joe Kubert, John Romita Sr. etc.) explained that with the advances in comic technology in the modern age, readers and fans expect much more of the illustrator in terms of detail and draughtsmanship etc., as a result the onus rests on the artist to provide a more detailed and well drafted page, considerations which contribute to the slow output of his pages.\nAlthough Kubert remains an abundantly talented penciller, the choice of inker for his work greatly influences the quality of the final printed page. It has been argued by fans and critics alike through various mediums such as the internet and comic publications, that some of Kubert's finest work has been embellished by the British inker Mark Farmer, especially his runs on Wolverine and The Incredible Hulk for Marvel Comics. Whilst other talented inkers, notably Danny Miki and John Dell, lent their talents to Kubert's pencils during his runs on Ultimate X-Men and Ultimate Fantastic Four respectively, reaction to the final artwork was mixed due to the stylistic nature of the inkers which did not lend itself well to Kubert's normally lush drawings, leading to increasing calls that Adam Kubert should once again be paired up with Mark Farmer, even more so now that Kubert has moved to DC Comics as of 2006.\nWhen Marvel Comics launched the industry changing Ultimate Universe in 2001, Adam Kubert was chosen as the penciller for the second launch bookUltimate X-Men. His storytelling and distinct style coupled with writerMark Millar's well crafted tales, made the book an instant success. Kubert was also chosen as the penciller to launch the ultimate universe version of Marvel's first family, the Ultimate Fantastic Four, once again with writers Mark Millar andBrian Michael Bendis. Both series launched to commercial and critical acclaim, firmly establishing Kubert as an industry heavyweight and one of Marvel's \"go-to guys\" for their major projects.\nAn accomplished inker, he received an Eisner Award for his inking duties on the Dark Horse-DC ComicsBatman vs. Predatorcrossover in the early 1990s. In addition to this, Kubert is well renowned for his lettering ability, being the youngest professional comic book letterer at the age of only 11 years old. His very own handwriting was used as the template for the font used in the Ultimate X-Men comics, additionally Kubert's early lettering work on the now defunct Heavy Metal magazine was used by DC comics as the basis for most of the fonts used in their comics and magazines.\nBoth Adam and his brother Andy signed exclusive contracts to work for DC Comics in 2005. (At the same time, their father wrote a Sgt. Rock mini-series for the company.) This came as somewhat of a shock to the industry as both the Kuberts (along withJohn Romita, Jr.) were known as Marvel comics' stalwarts, and they were well known for their company loyalty. When Valiant Comics tried to lure the brothers over from Marvel in 1994 for exorbitant sums of money, they both blindly refused opting to keep their home at Marvel Comics. In an interview for the magazineWizard, the brothers made clear that they held no animosity for Marvel, but instead were excited for the chance to work on DC titles for a change. The brothers also work as teachers at the Joe Kubert School, founded by their father (who also teaches there). Adam teaches first year classes, Andy second, and Joe third.\nStarting in 2008, Kubert illustrated \"Last Son\", a Superman story co-written by the superstar writing team of Geoff Johns and Richard Donner (he of the original Superman movie fame). Kubert was originally slated to begin his arc on Action Comics with issue #841 in July 2008, but for reasons not given by DC comics he is only due to start in October. Industry speculation was that DC was finalizing the deal with Johns and Donner and additionally wanted to provided Kubert with sufficient lead time to complete as many issues of Action Comics before going to print.\nActions Comics #844, Kubert's first comic for DC since signing his exclusive contract, was published in late November 2006. Based on the hype generated by DC's marketing department as well as coverage received in Entertainment Weekly, the book was a commercial success, selling out its first printing resulting in DC going back to print for issue #844.\nA month later, on 3rd December 2006, issue #845 was released to similar commercial acclaim as the preceding issue once again forcing DC to go back to press for a second printing on the 23rd February 2007. Issue #846, part 3 of the \"Last Son\" storyline, due to be released on 30th December 2006, was pushed back only to be released on the 28th February 2007. In mid February 2007, DC revealed that the planned all 3D issue of Action Comics, issue #848, which was originally solicited for a April 2007, has been cancelled. No reason was given for the cancellation prompting speculation that Kubert was falling behind on deadlines. This was later confirmed on 21st February 2007 when on his personal forum, ComicBloc.com, writer Geoff Johns revealed that the reason for the delays in Action's schedule was due to Adam Kubert falling behind in the penciling and inking and not on Johns and Donner themselves.\nBatman: Batman vs. Predator: He inked the entire mini series over Andy Kubert's pencils. He received anEisner Awardfor his contribution.\nWriters\nInkers\nColourists"

When the Avengers and other remaining heroes identified the cause of the disappearance was him, they flew toEmpire Unlimited Headquarters.\nAugustus Roman\nThe Avengers had unsuccessfully confronted Augustus Roman, who had named himself the Regent. Roman had acquired the means to mimic the abilities of superheroes by harvesting genetic materials from their corpses after killing them. Regent killed the Avengers and the other heroes, leaving onlySpider-Man, who wasn't present at the final battle. With the Regent having taken control over thedomainby force, Peter decided to retire the mantle of Spider-Man to focus on protecting his family.[1]\nA few years later, he decided to unleash theSinister Sixto hunt down Spider-Man, now that he had been spotted.[2]Regent then made a television broadcast announcing a compulsory screening atAnnie'sschool. When Peter,MJ, and Annie arrived to the building the following day, they were able to pass the scans. However, another kid was revealed as having powers, forcing Peter to jump into action as Spider-Man to defend him. While he faced the rest of the Sinister Six,MockingbirdandProwler, who were disguised as Regent's agents, discovered Annie was the other powered kid, and abducted her and her mother.[3]\nAsRegent\nSpider-Man finished dealing with the Sinister Six whenSandman, also working forS.H.I.E.L.D., tried to convince Parker to follow him.

One day, she would find out that thePower familywas secretly thePower Packand witnessed her father use his powers to rescue them.[9]\nAnnie Parker\nWhenKraven the Hunterrealized Spider-Man was fighting like a scared father, Regent called in all families connected toPublic School 122 Mamie Fayfor a power screening. Despite passing, thanks to herInhibitor Chip, a fellow classmate,Lewis, was outed as amutant. With her father abandoning them to save Lewis,Mysteriowas able to locate Annie and her mother. Luckily, however,S.H.I.E.L.D.found them first.[10]\nReunited with the Power Pack, Annie was given a costume to go along with her powers, much to her mother's dismay. Suddenly, theSinister Sixinvade the base. As they were escaping, Annie turned back and quickly subduedBoomerang,Rhino,Shocker, and Kraven. This convinced her mother to turn back and, together, rescue her father.[11]\nAnnie joins the fight\nInvadingEmpire Unlimited's headquarters, Annie quickly dispatchedDr.Shannon Stillwell, despite the villain's superior strength. She started removing Regent's connection to the heroes' stasis cells, effectively depleting his powers. When Regent arrived to stop them, Annie's father broke free of his imprisonment and tackled Regent out the window. AMP, her new code name, jumped out the window and used an Inhibitor Chip-infusedTrick Arrowto depower Regent; however, even with his powers neutralized, the Regent was still a threat. Peter, Annie, and MJ teamed up to beat him up, but the Regent got hold of Annie. Peter bluffed his way next to the Regent, and made a joke that caused the villain to laugh and be distracted for long enough so Peter could strike a finishing blow that knocked him out, though he had initially intended to deal a killing blow. S.H.I.E.L.D. proceeded to take the Regent into custody using an improvised restraining unit created by theProwler. With the Regent neutralized, Peter, MJ, and Annie resumed their normal lives.[3]\nAMP was recruited by theS.H.I.E.L.D.ofEarth-TRN461into theSpider-Men, a group of Spider-Man analogs, to help battle theMultiversal Sinister Six. She also became a member of theSpider-Force. During this time, she was taken in by the nativePeter ParkerandMary Jane Watsonand was even enrolled in school.\nAmong theSpider-Men\nPeter attempted to help her create a suit to protect MJ; however, all imports into New York City were blocked due to the Sinister Six's invasion. Annie informed them of the powersuit her mother used to help fight Reagent, which Peter then promptly took from Earth-18119's Empire Unlimited. On her way to school, Annie was seemingly attacked by her reality's Venom. Overcoming her fear, she discovered he was an illusion conjured by an alternateMysterio. She came to considerSpider-Ma'amandAnti-Venomher honorary great-aunt and uncle, respectfully. Annie was later joined by her mother, who used a newsuitto become the super hero Spinneret.[12]\nShortly after Peter Parker took up being Spider-Man once more,Mole Manattacked the ruins ofEmpire Unlimited Headquarters. As Peter and MJ faced the threat, Annie’s premonitions showed her parents fightingMoloids, so she suited up to join the fight.[13]Shortly thereafter she was captured,[1]though she was quickly rescued by her parents.[14]While Peter and MJ argued about their daughter being in danger as a superhero, Annie slipped away to confront the villain herself.[13]The Parkers defeated Mole-Man and his army soon after, and Anna-May was dubbed ‘Spiderling’ by her father following the success.[2]\nAsSpiderling\nLater, during Peter’s birthday party atMJ'sinSoHo, the Parkers were approached byProfessor X, who showed interest in Anna-May as a possible student atXavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Annie toured the school withJubileeandShine. While arguing with Jubilee, Annie was struck by a premonition which showed her parents and theX-Mengetting attacked in theDanger Room. At that moment, theBrotherhood of Evil Mutantsstruck on the school grounds. Annie and Katie were taken intoCerebrobyMagneto, where it was revealed that Jubilee had betrayed the X-Men.[15]Annie grew increasingly furious with Jubilee, upsetting Kate, who used her powers to cause a distraction, allowing both of them to escape. Anna-May later attacked Jubilee upon seeing her ambush the X-Men. Spiderling and her parents went to confront Magneto andEmma Frost; Spinneret took down both. With the villains apprehended, Peter and MJ concluded that they would talk about allowing Annie to attend the school.[16]\nBefore turning 16, Annie would get approached byMiguel O'HaraofEarth-928B, a futuristic universe in the year 2099, to join his Strike Force to protect theMultiversealongside her mother.\nThe Parkers pursuedRhino, however Spiderling was forced to stay behind. Spider-Man and Spinneret became incapacitated, and Annie rushed in to help. As a result, she was kidnapped by the Rhino and his masked goons. Annie wakes up to find herself imprisoned in Oscorp, withNormie Osborn. The two bicker, with Normie revealing how lonely he was and Annie sympathizing with him. She told him that killing Spider-Man wouldn't make him happy, and offered him her friendship.[17]While theGoblin Mechattacked the city, Spinneret rescued Annie, with the help ofLiz Allan. They find Normie injured, stating that he attempted to stop the mech. He informed them thatMs. Januarywas piloting the Goblin Armor. Spiderling was guided by Normie throughout the mech, where she ultimately destroyed the armor. Later, Normie thanked Spiderling and the two become friends.[18]\nWhen the spider hunters known as theInheritorsused clone bodies to escape their imprisonment, Annie was visited bySpider-GirlandSpider-Woman, heroes fromalternateearths, at the same time she started having visions of the future threats. After learning with her parents the threat that the Inheritors represented, Annie realized that she could feel the scrolls Spider-Girl brought to their reality, which meant that she was connected to theWeb of Life and Destiny. While her parents joined theSpider-Armyto fight the Inheritors, Annie was left under the care of Anya and Mayday Parker, the alternate version of herstillborn sister.[19]\nAs a member of theSpider-Army\nThe three spider-heroes managed to cure the six-armed Normie Osborn from Annie's reality while fightingBoraandBrix. After Annie managed to successfully connect to the Great Web, Anya and Mayday realized that she was a newSpider-Totemknown as The Patternmaker.[20]Annie then opened a portal to reunited with the rest of the Spider-Army and defeat the Inheritors, that were later turned into babies.[21]\nWhile repairing the Great Web, Annie discovered a section that was corrupted and dissolved into viscous red ooze when she touched it. Sensing that the entity responsible for the corruption,Carnage, would endanger the Multiverse if left unchecked, Anne's Spider-Sense led her toJon Shayde- an NYPD detective fromEarth-616who had been infected by an offshoot of the Carnage symbiote. Pulling him into the ruins of Loomworld, Annie introduced herself as the Patternmaker and gave him a quick overview of the Web of Life before sending him toNiffleheim.[22]\nContinuing her repairs, Annie accidentally unleashed the dark wasp-goddessShathra,[4]who had been trapped in the Primal Strand of the Web of Life following the death of her physical form at the fangs ofthe Other.[23]Intent on slaughtering the Spider-Totems, destroying the Great Web, and replacing it with her Great Nest, Shathra stung Annie — her venom converting her from a Spider-Totem avatar into a Wasp-Totem avatar that Shathra dubbed the Nestling.[4]\nSpider Physiology:"

When the Avengers and other remaining heroes identified the cause of the disappearance as Augustus Roman, the C.E.O. ofEmpire Unlimited, a company researching super-abilities and bio-technologies, they flew toEmpire Unlimited Headquarters.Spider-Manwas about to join them, but he realized one of the potential escapees wasVenom, who would be coming after his family.\nSpider-Man swung to his apartment, where he found his family in Venom's grasp. When he engaged the symbiotic villain in battle,Mary Janetook their babyAnnieout of the building, and decided to follow a firetruck to a building set aflame, where she could be safe from Venom due to thesymbiote's weakness against fire. Venom soon followed Mary Jane to the building, but Spider-Man arrived just in time and forced the villain into the blazing building. Upon being notified the building had been evacuated, Spider-Man realized what he had to do to prevent Venom from coming back to endanger his family ever again. Spider-Man collapsed the structure, seemingly causing Venom to be crushed and burned to death.\nMeanwhile, the Avengers had unsuccessfully confronted Augustus Roman, who had named himself the Regent. Roman had acquired the means to mimic the abilities of superheroes by harvesting genetic materials from their corpses after killing them. Regent killed the Avengers and the other heroes, leaving only Spider-Man who wasn't present at the final battle. With the Regent having taken control over the domain by force, Peter decided to retire the mantle of Spider-Man to focus on protecting his family.[1]\nTo prevent their powers from being scanned, Peter and Annie usedinhibitor bracelets. The night before starting school, Annie's inhibitor broke down, and the next day she had to keep her powers down in hopes they wouldn't be noticed. After taking photos ofD-Man, who was protesting against the Regent's regime, being taken down byBoomerang,Shocker, andRhino, Peter headed to theDaily Bugle, where he overheard that the Regent's forces had found super-powered people in the same school,Public School 122 Mamie Fay. Using his hood as his only disguise, Peter jumped through the city and got to the school, where he found thePower Packfending off the Regent's goons. Spider-Man distracted the villains and forced the kids to escape, while Mary Jane retrieved Annie. Back on the Regent's headquarters, he decided to unleash theSinister Sixto hunt down Spider-Man, now that he had been spotted.[2]\nSpider-Man tried to buy power inhibitors from theTinkerer, but the latter alerted the Sinister Six, of whichDoctor Octopuscame to get Spider-Man. Spider-Man violently subdued Otto before the Sinister Six arrived to the scene, and were left only with the information that he had taken inhibitor chips.Kravendeduced he was trying to protect somebody by using the chips, for which he most likely had a family, specifically a child. Peter returned to his home and reconfigured the inhibitor chips for Annie, when the Regent made a television broadcast announcing a compulsory screening in Annie's school. When Peter, MJ, and Annie arrived to the building the following day, they were able to pass the scans. However, another kid was discovered having powers, forcing Peter to jump into action as Spider-Man to defend him. While he faced the rest of the Sinister Six,MockingbirdandProwler, who were disguised as Regent's agents, discovered Annie was the other powered kid, and abducted her and her mother.[3]\nSpider-Man finished dealing with the Sinister Six whenSandman, also working forS.H.I.E.L.D., tried to convince Parker to follow him. Peter doubted Sandman's word, which allowed enough time for the Regent to personally appear and subdue both of them. Meanwhile, Annie and MJ were introduced to S.H.I.E.L.D. and its leader,Hawkeye. While Spider-Man and Marko were brought to the Regent's base,Dr. Johnny Ohnnworked at the resistance's base to reverse engineer Annie's inhibitor bracelet, and he created an arrow-head which could neutralize the Regent's powers, but only needed a DNA sample from him. The resistance's base was invaded by the Sinister Six after the Regent read Sandman's mind to learn of its location, while S.H.I.E.L.D. used one of Ohnn's portals to escape, Annie jumped into action, helping to hold back the villains. Another portal was opened, which had been sewn into Sandman. Marko activated it to let S.H.I.E.L.D. get into the Regent's stronghold. Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and Prowler entered it, and they were soon followed by MJ and Annie.[4]"

Mary Jane would become very fearful of her daughter's liberal use of her powers, and when Peter made his return as Spider-Man, she convinced her husband not to leave Regency, but to hide in the shadows using hisblack suit.[6]\nWhenKraven the Hunterrealized Spider-Man was fighting like a scared father,Regentcalled in all families connected toPublic School 122 Mamie Fayfor a power screening. Despite her family passing, a fellow classmate of Annie's,Lewis, was outed as aMutant. With Peter abandoning them to save Lewis,Mysteriowas able to locate Mary Jane and her daughter. Luckily however,S.H.I.E.L.D.found them first.[7]\nAs Mary Jane acquainted herself with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, she quickly became annoyed with their lack of urgency to rescue her husband, and the idea of no longer having a life; however, her outlook rapidly changed as Annie made quick work of the invadingSinister Six. This convinced her to leave with theAvengersto rescue Peter themselves rather than run to safety.[8]\nWhile the Avengers tried and failed to neutralize the Regent, Annie decided to help her father, and struck the villain with anInhibitor Chip-infusedTrick Arrowobtained fromHawkeye; however, even with his powers neutralized, the Regent was still a threat. Peter, Annie, and MJ, usingDr. Shannon Stillwell'sEmpire Unlimited Test Suit, teamed up to beat him up, but the Regent got hold of Annie.\nWearingShannon Stillwell'ssuit\nSpider-Man bluffed his way next to the Regent, and made a joke that caused the villain to laugh and be distracted long enough for Peter to strike a finishing blow that knocked him out. The Avengers then proceeded to take the Regent into custody using an improvised restraining unit created by theProwler.[9]\nFollowing the restoration of the Multiverse,[10]Peter reversed engineered Regent's Empire Unlimited Test Suit to mimic his own spider-powers for his wife, since Annie was increasingly engaging in super-heroics and needed someone to keep an eye on her.[11]\nUnder her new role, MJ was recruited by theS.H.I.E.L.D.ofEarth-TRN461into theSpider-Men, a group of Spider-Man analogs assembled to combat theMultiversal Sinister Six.[3]\nMary Jane onEarth-TRN461\nMeanwhile, MJ had openeda boutiqueinSoHowhich drew the attention ofa prominent fashion critic. She went to the diner next door to celebrate the development only to learn that Spider-Man was involved in an incident at the former site of Empire Unlimited Headquarters.\nDonningher new costume, MJ went to assist Spider-Man in a fight against theMole Man's forces. There she rescued her daughter from theMoloidsand agreed with Peter that Annie should stay back.\nPeter then informed her that there was something wrong with the Regent tech MJ was utilizing to mimic his powers. While they were talking, the ground gave way and the pair fell down intoSubterranea. Waking they found Mole Man plotting to use some of Regent's tech for himself. When asked who she was, MJ claimed she wasSpinneretand that she was angry.[1]\nIn order to avoid the constant power drain her suit exerted on her husband, Spinneret accepted a biotechnological suit provided byLiz Allan. In reality, the suit was theVenom SymbiotethatAllan Biotechhad somehow acquired.[2]Eventually, the suit assumed control over her and tried to kill Spider-Man to exact vengeance on him for killing Eddie Brock years earlier, but MJ faced the symbiote in a mental incursion, and, with Peter's help, she suppressed its hold over her, bringing it totally under her sway.[12]\nBonded to theVenom Symbiote\nHer bond with the suit had left her vulnerable to thePoisons, an extra-dimensional life form that needed to bond with asymbiote, feeding off its host's nutrients to complete the bonding process. Because of this, Venomized versions ofCaptain AmericaandDoctor Strangerecruited her to help them defeat the Poisons while she was in a medical appointment.[13]Despite being there to help, she andan alternate version of Spider-Manthat kept theVenom symbiotehad conflicts with theEddie Brockfrom thePrime Marvel Universebecause of everything that their own versions of Eddie Brock did to them, judging he was likely no different from them.[14]In the end, they were able to stop the Poisons by causing their ship to explode moments after Doctor Strange returned her andthe other Venomsto their proper realities.[15]\nShortly afterwards, the Spider-Family became involved in a battle withMs. January, the conclusion of which resulted in the destruction of the Venom symbiote stuck to MJ. Afterwards, Mary Jane resumed using her original Spinneret outfit.[16]\nAt some point, MJ and Annie joinedMiguel O'Hara'sSpider Societybased onEarth-928B. MJ was in the cafeteria when Miguel ordered the entire Spider Society to chase escapingMiles Morales, though did not pursue until the chase spilled into where she was. She was also among the army of Spider-People pursuing Miles into the space elevator train bound for the moon, narrowly avoiding Miguel when he was pushed back by Miles.[17]\nSpinneret andSpiderlingonEarth-928B\nAfter Annie started having strange visions, the family was visited by two Spider-Girls from other realities:Anya CorazónandMayday Parker, a grown up version of their latedaughter. They explained that all Spiders were connected by the GreatWeb of Life and Destinyand that theInheritorshave returned, threatening everyone who was connected to it. Annie felt a connection to mystical scrolls brought by Anya, so Peter and MJ left her with the safety of the Spider-Girls, while they themselves went to join the fight raging onEarth-616.[18]They joined theSpider-Armyand were part of the team that went toEarth-13to investigate the Enigma Force.[19]Despite the efforts of other Spiders,Soluswas brought back to life and none of the Spider could match him. The fight went bad, and Peter and MJ said their last words and shared their last kiss. MJ only lamented that she could not see Annie one more time when she and the other Spider-Girls arrived fromLoomworld. Annie was revealed to be the Patternmaker and provided a boost to her teammates, who joined many other newly-arriving Spiders to defeat the Inheritors once again.[20]"
