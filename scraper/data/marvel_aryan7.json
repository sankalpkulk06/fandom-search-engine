Gemma begrudgingly obliges, complaining to herself about her male colleagues' sexism under her breath. When her order is called, Gemma collects the coffee and steps out the door to see the sky is pitch-black and the city is swarming withSymbiote Dragons.\nIn the present, Gemma is snapped out of her reminiscing byArthur Krane, who places a cup of coffee in front of her and says he got it just how she likes it. Smiling, Gemma thanks him and Arthur apologizes for how overworked she is on account of Senator Krane's upcomingFriends of Humanityrally. Gemma shrugs it off, saying it comes with the territory of being Krane's chief communications officer, and Arthur comments that he thinks she's doing an amazing job despite her work being under-appreciated. Arthur suggests she do something to cut loose and enjoy herself, Gemma smiling as she says she hasn't gone for a run in a long time.\nLater,Flash Thompson,Andi Benton, andBren Waterswalk through the National Mall, pointedly ignoring a Friends of Humanity supporter trying to recruit them. As Andi comments in disgust on the sheer amount of Friends of Humanity propaganda, Flash suggests they rendezvous withHankand see what he knows of Senator Krane's plans. Glancing at a poster the recruiter gave him, Bren asks if people really believe such hateful things, and Flash explains that when people are scared they latch onto information that comforts them - even if that information is misleading or false, which makes them susceptible to charismatic demagogues like Senator Krane. Out for her jog, Gemma unwittingly runs past them.\nLater that night, Gemma jogs through the city and is accosted by a trio of street thugs, who pull knives on her and threateningly tells her to smile for them. Grinning wickedly, Gemma transforms intoAgonyand douses two of the thugs with a torrent of acid, roaring as she decapitates two with slashes from her claws. Grabbing the surviving thug by the neck, she licks his face - burning a furrow into his cheek with her corrosive saliva - and mocking tells him to smile for her before chomping into his head. Sighing contentedly, Gemma retracts the Agony symbiote from her head and wipes a bit of brain from her cheek, commenting that Arthur was right and she feels much better now.\nThe next day, Gemma comes into the office looking refreshed and some of her coworkers sneer that she must have had sex, asking if the \"Ice Queen\" gave her lover frostbite. Arthur glares at the men and calls them disgusting, but Gemma brushes off their sexism and steps into the break room to get some coffee. Following, Arthur says he strongly disapproves of how his father runs things and confides that he's considering running against him in the future. Intrigued, Gemma smirks and pours him a mug of coffee, Arthur asking if she would consider coming to work for him. Toasting him, Gemma says she would like that.\nMeeting with Hank in an apartment, Flash asks for the soldier-turned-bodyguard to fill him in on what he knows. Grinning, Hank comments that Senator Krane doesn't suspect he's a spy, letting him obtain all sorts of secretive details due to being considered unimportant; filling them in that Senator Krane is plotting to hijack the President's memorial speech for the people killed during Knull's invasion. Rolling her eyes, Andi comments that evenCarnagewouldn't seriously consider trying to assassinate the President in broad daylight, but Flash sternly says that he absolutely does and will do so if nobody stops him. Bren curses out loud, Flash concurring before saying the public murder of the President will throw the country into chaos -- in keeping with Carnage's usual MO. Horrified, Hank asks if Flash is serious about Senator Krane being Carnage, then asks if Flash and his accomplices have symbiotes as well. Flash apologizes for not letting Hank know sooner, saying he wanted to keep him safe. Grumbling that he's not feeling very safe between the assassination plot and finding out his new boss is being puppeteered by Carnage, Hank asks how Flash plans to stop him. Turning to Andi, Flash says that herSilence symbioteis their ace in the hole and asks if she can sense Carnage andhis Hivenow that they're closer. Closing her eyes and concentrating, Andi transforms into Silence and says that ever since their meeting with Toxin she's been worried that tapping into the Hive-Mind is a two-way street; noting that she'll try anyway and that she can sense someone.\nAt her apartment, which is decorated with dismembered and mutilated body parts, Gemma hangs the severed arm of one of the thugs above her television and eyes it contemplatively, asking the Agony symbiote if it thinks the arm looks good on their mantleplace. Mimicking her, the Agony symbiote says they don't have a mantle to hang it over, Gemma saying that she meant the space on the wall. Eyeing it, Gemma says she thinks it looks tacky, but the Agony symbiote says it looks perfect. Commenting that she thinks something's missing, Gemma chastizes the Agony symbiote for eating the thug's other arm - preventing them from having a matching set, before cheerfully patting it on the head and saying she's not mad and that they'll just have to get another. Pulling them into the Hive-Mind, Carnage comments that he loves what she's done with her apartment, Gemma irritibly snaps that she told him she didn't want to be contacted outside of work hours. Quipping it's happy hour and time for some team bonding, Carnage conjures a bartop and morphshis symbioteto look like a bartender, telling Gemma to take a seat as he summons the other symbiotes under his command. The Agony symbiote transforming into a purple dress, Gemma sits betweenPhage- having assumeda canine form- andRiot, ordering a gin and tonic. As Carnage says he'll oblige and mixes a drink, Gemma glances at Phage,Lasher,Scream, and the other assembled symbiotes and comments that if this meeting is about the big event they're missing a few recruits. Pouring red ooze into a cocktail glass, Carnage replies that if she's talking about Silence andToxin, they'll be there.\nInfiltrating the Hive-Mind, Silence notes that Carnage and all the Life Foundation symbiotes are there, but that she's too far away to hear what they're saying. As she flies closer, Carnage says that with what he has planned there's no way they'll be able to stay way; revealing he's aware that Andi's there and impaling her in the chest with a tendril, causing the Silence symbiote to manifest a fanged maw and roar in pain. Disconnecting from the Hive-Mind, Andi tells Flash that Carnage knows they're coming. Transforming intoAgent Anti-Venom, Flash says they may have lost the element of surprise but that at least they know Carnage is expecting them, Bren transforming into Toxin. As Silence, Toxin, and Agent Anti-Venom set out, Hank calls out asking what he should do given he lacks a symbiote of his own; Agent Anti-Venom telling him to not let the President out of his sight and telling his allies to be careful.\nIn the Hive-Mind, Gemma eyeballs the drink and notes that it's not a gin and tonic, Carnage cheerfully admitting he has no clue how to make one anyway. As Carnage asks if she's having second thoughts regarding their alliance, Gemma scoffs and takes the drink -- telling him not to forget the promise he made to her and the Agony symbiote. Saying he'd never do so, Carnage pours a glass of his own and toasts the Hive.\nThe next day, Agent Anti-Venom, Silence, and Toxin watch the President's memorial speech from a distance. Hank warily watches as Gemma tells Senator Krane it's time to hijack the show, Senator Krane walking out to cheers from his adoring fans. As Arthur congratulates everyone on a job well-done and Gemma assures \"Mr. Riot\" that all the pieces are in place, the three turn to stare ominously at Hank. Calling Flash, Hank informs him that Senator Krane is about to begin his speech, noting that he doesn't see any of the Life Foundation symbiotes orAlchemax'sGuardsmen. Pondering the situation, Flash realizes that they've got everything wrong as Hank is suddenly impaled from behind by a red-and-black blade, Arthur Krane unveiling himself as Carnage's host. Taking his phone, Carnage mockingly apologizes for cutting him off before turning to Agony, Riot, and Phage, saying they're on a tight schedule and have a speech to catch.\nENTER: AGONY!"

Furthermore, Hank senses thatsomethingis profoundly wrong with Senator Krane himself - noting that he almost-never seems to blink or even breathe, and that his gaze feels sinister and predatory - like a shark's. Closing a deal with a representative of Nation West Airlines, Senator Krane smiles menacingly as he tells Hank to sit out his upcoming meeting and look after Buddy. As Hank nervously looks around at the other security guards staring ominously at him,Arthur Kraneinterjects to inform his father that his next MVP guest will be arriving soon. Vetoing Arthur volunteering to go pick him up, Senator Krane decides to send Hank instead. In a flashback, a man in an orange shirt and baseball cap boards a Greyhound bus and sits at the back, theRiot symbiote's tendrils oozing around his fingers.\nInAlchemax's astrobiology lab,Agent Anti-VenomandDr. Stevenwarily approachSilence. Retractinghis symbiotefrom his head, Flash Thompson calls outAndi Benton's name, Silence holding a finger to her face before reprimanding him to call it by its chosen moniker. Flash acknowledges the Silence symbiote but insists it let him speak to Andi so that he can know she's safe. After a moment of contemplation, Silence retracts from Andi Benton's head to reveal her alive and well, Andi excitedly gushing about her victory overPhage. Embracing her, Flash says that he's just happy she's OK and that he was terrified she was going to die. Smiling, Andi says she's still alive and that the Silence symbiote has already healed her chest wound. Andi's admiration of her new appearance and how powerful she feels is interrupted by Dr. Steven - who startles her by enthusiastically telling her to tell him everything, asking if bonding to Silence felt different from bonding toScream. As an alarm goes off, Flash says they need to get out before moreGuardsmenarrive, Dr. Steven admitting that's a good course of action. As they web-swing away, Silence asks Agent Anti-Venom if he has a plan, and Agent Anti-Venom replies that he does.\nSipping coffee at a café, Andi incredulously asks if Flash's plan is seriously to rely on his old war-buddy who flunked out of the army, grousing that she's never met him and that even Flash openly admits he's a screwup. Andi asks if Flash seriously expects him to stumble across an Anti-Carnage weapon, and Flash responds that Andi is the Anti-Carnage weapon, reminding her that her new symbiote's cleansing touch severed Phage's connection to the Hive, and that she could do the same toCarnageby taking the fight directly to him within the Hive-Mind. Alarmed, Andi protests that she'sWeb of Venom: Funeral Pyre#1and almost died, that his hold over the Scream symbiote was one it hadn't been able to resist, and that he's made the Symbiote Hive-Mind his personal playground.\nOn the Greyhound bus, Carnage reaches out to the Riot symbiote through the Hive-Mind, causing the interior of the bus to appear like it's made of meat, bone, and entrails. Telling Riot he's putting together a family reunion and wants it to be there, Carnage boops its snout - infecting it with his will. The Carnage-infested Riot erupts from its host's body, killing him, and proceeds to butcher the other passengers on the bus while looking for a suitable new host - Carnage cheerfully encouraging it to be even more brutal and vicious.\nIn the café, Flash reassures Andi that she can do this, telling her he's seen how badass she was as Silence, Scream, and even without any symbiote at all. Nudging her chin to get her to look at him, Flash tells Andi she's much stronger than she thinks she is, and that Carnage won't know what hit him. Steeling herself, Andi plunges into the Symbiote Hive-Mind as Silence and challenges Carnage to come and get her, but is shocked to find herself floating in a vast dark emptiness. As Flash asks what's wrong, Andi opens her eyes and tells him that she can't connect to the Hive-Mind and that it's gone. Flash asks how that's possible, and Andi speculates that Dr. Steven accidentally broke or tainted something when creating the Silence symbiote from the Scream symbiote's remains. Flash urges Andi to try again, but she's snaps that she not just unable to sense Carnage butanyof the other symbiotes -- notLasher, Phage,Agony,Riot, or evenVenom-- remarking that she remembers what their presence feels like but that their connection has somehow been fractured, corrupted, or erased.\nOn the bus, Riot corners a man in a blue shirt, who screams at it to stay away from him. Commenting that he's not too big and not too small, Riot bonds to the man and says that he feels just right.\nNoticing Andi is developing a nosebleed, Flash apologizes for having pushed her so hard, but Andi retorts she's not giving up - saying that she knows the other symbiotes are out there somewhere and that she'll keep trying until she finds them.\nAt the bus depot, Hank stands at the terminal as the Greyhound pulls in and the door opens, holding a sign reading \"Mr. Riot\". The Riot symbiote's new host - now clad in a dark blue suit - shakes his hand and says they shouldn't keep Senator Krane waiting.\nExiting the café, Flash and Andi walk down the street together; but as Flash says fighting Carnage within the Hive-Mind was a long-shot anyway Andi suddenly detects the presence of another symbiote. Plunging into the Hive-Mind, she sees the vague outline ofa red-and-black symbioteshe doesn't recognize, opening her eyes and recoiling in alarm just asToxinlands between her and Flash, cheerfully asking if they called him."

He's splashed by some radioactive biohazard material in an accident, which blinds him. He learns to overcome this disability and developing a kind of 'sixth sense' which allows him to \"see\" by using sound waves to create a mental image of his surroundings. His father is murdered by theKingpin, and Murdock vows to avenge him.\n\nThe film was regarded as a modest success at the box office, although it did not make as much money as theX-MenandSpider-Manfilms. Though the original production was geared towards a darker, more adult film, the success of the then just releasedSpider-Manprompted Fox to curb the more mature elements and re-envision the film as a summer action vehicle in mid-production.\nFan and critical reactions were mixed at best. Much disapproval was heaped upon Ben Affleck for his performance as Daredevil, whom many fans felt was not right for the role. Besides Ben Affleck, there was mixed fan reaction to the increased budget for CGI effects and retooling of the tone. There was also a small amount of controversy concerning the casting of African American actor Michael Clarke Duncan as the villainous Kingpin, whose traditional comic ethnicity was of Anglo-European descent. Jennifer Garner, who playedElektra, fared slightly better, however, and won her own spin off,Elektra, but it did poorly at the box office. The highest praise went to Colin Farrell, whose portrayal of the maniacal Bullseye was well received by fans and critics alike (an ability he has demonstrated in many movies).\nDaredevil's premise departed from what has been established in the long-running comic book series. In the film, Daredevil is a vigilante who has no problems executing criminals who escape justice (although he changes his ways by the end of the film). In the comic series, Daredevil is a principled individual who believes in upholding the rule of law above all else. His principles in the comics have led to conflicts with other superheroes such asSpider-Man,Wolverine, and thePunisher, and, as his alter ego Matt Murdock, sometimes defend the criminals he catches in court.\nA glaring error in the film is the nature of the courtroom trial shown at the beginning. Matt Murdock is a defense lawyer working in a private practice. The film depicts him prosecuting an alleged rapist. This would actually be done by a government prosecutor, not a private attorney, unless it was a civil trial, although this would be inconsistent with many other details in the film.\nDavid Fear of MSN Movies ranksDaredevilas the second worst superhero movie to date, behindBatman and Robin.[1]Roger Ebert's review rated it favorably compared to other superhero films.[2]\nIn December 2004, a director's cut of the film was released on DVD. This version added 30 minutes of footage not seen in the original, including an entire subplot involving Murdock defending a murder suspect played by rapper Coolio, which allows Foggy to uncover evidence of the Kingpin's true identity. It also won quite a few more fans than the initial theatrical release.\nThe following scenes were deleted that were featured in the PG-13 cut of the film:\nMichael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin\nThe following additions were made:\nDaredevil: The Albumwas released in 2003 by Wind-Up Records for the movie Daredevil, starring Ben Affleck. All songs were previously unreleased, and some songs appeared on later releases. Unlike later Wind-Up soundtrack releases, many songs from Daredevil: The Album notably appeared in the film.\nThe album was one of the first collaborations between Marvel Comics and Wind-Up Records, which would continue with the releases of Fantastic Four and the Daredevil sequel/spin-off Elektra. Three singles were released from the album: Fuel's \"Won't Back Down\", The Calling's \"For You\", and Evanescence's \"Bring Me to Life\", the first major appearance by Evanescence which would lead to \"Bring Me to Life\" reaching number one on the Billboard Chart.\nThree songs were omitted from release on the album: N.E.R.D.'s \"Lapdance\", Dara Shindler's \"Faraway\", and House of Pain's \"Top o' the Morning to Ya\".\nOther appearances:"

He earned a bachelor's degree in illustration at the New York School of Visual Arts. For a time he earned his living as a musician.[citation needed]\nIn 1991 he became a colorist for Valiant Comics. His first penciling job was onSpelljammerat DC, where he also worked onThe Question,The Ray,andBatman: Sword of Azrael.In 1992 he won the Harvey Award for best new talent. His exceptional work led to other assignments at Marvel, Chaos, Dark Horse, Harris, Image, Topps, and Valiant.[citation needed]\nBy 1994 he was ready to strike out on his own. With Laurie Bradach and Jimmy Palmiotti he founded Event Comics and createdAsh.Their other titles includedThe 22 Brides,Kid Death and Fluffy,andPainkiller Jane.[citation needed]\nThe success of Event Comics led to a major contract with Marvel to produceMarvel Knights.This new line of titles would showcase characters who had slipped out of the limelight, such as theBlack Panther(Vol. 3), theBlack Widow,Daredevil(Vol. 2), and theInhumans(Vol. 2). Quesada recruited fresh talent from outside the mainstream, includingBrian Michael Bendis,Steve Dillon,Garth Ennis,David Mack,Mark Millar,Grant Morrison, andMichael Avon Oeming, to work on these titles. He even contributed pencils for a Daredevil story written by Kevin Smith. The Knights line became a hit, and so did Quesada.[citation needed]\nIn January 2000,Bill Jemasbecame the head of Marvel. As part of a campaign to revitalize and shake off the effects of bankruptcy, in August 2000 he sackedBob Harrasand installed Quesada as editor in chief. Rather than letting Marvel rest on its past glories, Jemas and Quesada brought in new talent and new ideas. The campaign worked; sales went up 75% in their first year and continued to rise.[citation needed]\nQuesada and Jemas presided over the introduction of the Ultimates line. Forty years of continuity had made it difficult to attract new readers. Their solution was to use the same classic characters but give them fresh starts, at once dropping the continuity baggage and updating the characters for a younger audience. Like the Knights, theUltimatesbecame a hit. During this time, they began repackaging comics as trade paperbacks and placing them in mainstream bookstores.[citation needed]\nOther projects created controversy. For instance,Wolverinehad always lacked a complete origin, and that mystery contributed to his appeal. Quesada and Jemas commissioned a miniseries, aptly and simply titledOrigin,to gave Wolverine a father and a childhood. After so much time and speculation, no story could meet the expectations for it; on the other hand, it gave this immensely popular character a new depth. Another project, the Max line, broke from the Comics Code Authority to offer adult content. In 2005, Quesada commissioned theDecimationevent, which rid all but 198 mutants of their powers. Although this was a creative move due to the sheer amount of mutants, further controversy occurred. Two years later he commissionedOne More Day, the storyline which marked the end of the 20 years-long marriage betweenPeter ParkerandMary Jane Watson, and is now considered by most fans to be one of the worst and most controversial Marvel stories of all time. He also created the idea of theRed Hulk.[citation needed]\nJemas became chief operating officer ofMarvel Entertainment Groupin 2002, while Quesada stayed in place. Any doubt that Jemas had \"carried\" Quesada vanished. He steered a difficult path between attracting new readers and alienating current readers, who are always quick to complain about changes to \"their\" comics. Disagreements with distributors, competition from other media, and a large lingering debt also made his job difficult. On the other hand, his unmistakable love for comics, enthusiasm for his job, and sure artistic judgment restored a measure of respect for Marvel that it had lost in the 1990s.[citation needed]\nAs an editor, Quesada made some policy shifts, with (as always) mixed reactions. The few Marvel characters who smoked could no longer do so, probably as a reaction to Quesada's father's battle with lung cancer, as well as a desire to provide good role models for children. Other changes included restoration of issue numbering (e.g.Amazing Spider-Manwent from volume 2 #58 to volume 1 #500), a prohibition on character deaths, and the discontinuation of footnotes.[citation needed]\nOver the years, Quesada continued the practices that had made him a major figure in the industry. He recruited the best talent he could find and gave them as much latitude as possible. Equally as importantly, he stayed in touch with fans and listened to their concerns and ideas.[citation needed]\nQuesada was inspired byStan Lee's \"Stan's Soapbox\" column in classic Marvel comics and the way that the column spoke directly to fans, letting them in \"behind-the-scenes\" to what was going on at Marvel. Quesada used this inspiration to begin writing a column in 2009 called \"Cup O' Joe,\" in which he would answer fan questions on any topic. Quesada published these columns exclusively on websites outside of theOfficial Marvel Siteso that fans would not feel like the questions were \"curated\" or \"filtered.\" DuringComic-Conevents, Quesada would often host this event live and take questions from the audience.[1]\nQuesada is a member of the Executive Committee of A Commitment To Our Roots (ACTOR), a non-profit organization that provides support for retired or disabled comics creators from the Golden and Silver Ages. Other members include Dick Giordano, Joe Kubert, Dennis O'Neil, George Perez, John Romita Sr., and Roy Thomas.[citation needed]\nQuesada has a wife, Nanci, and a daughter, Carlie, who is the inspiration for the characterCarlie Cooper. He lives in New York City. As of April 2014, he is still chief creative officer at Marvel and occasionally contributes art, such as forAge of Ultron#10.[citation needed]"

Their marriage eventually fell apart, causing Yinsen to move back toTimbetpal.[1]He kept in touch with Toni regardless, through letters, phone calls, and occasional visits.\nWhen Toni was eleven years old, Yinsen died savingTony Stark's life inSiancong. Because of this, Toni resented Stark, believing he should've done more to save her father. From then on, Toni set out to be better than him.[5]After the unpleasant experience of high school, Toni began to study programming and engineering. Her talent got her a scholarship toCaltech, where she overlapped studies and eventually got three doctorates. She joined A.I.M. whenBobby Da Costarebranded itAvengers Idea Mechanics,[1]and began to work for its Engineering Division.[6]\nToni took particular interest on studying the nature ofAikku Jokinen, a member of A.I.M.'sNew Avengerswhose body was merged with an intelligent suit of armor namedPod.[7]Her interest only increased upon merging minds with Aikku inAvenger Fivewhile the New Avengers foughtAmerican Kaiju, where she saw Aikku's real face.[8]Toni began to admire Aikku for the sacrifice that meant giving up on a normal life to remain merged with the armor solely to ensure Pod's systems wouldn't reset, which would be the equivalent of killing it.

After a mission shutting down the rogue A.I.M. splinter cellA.G.M., Aikku expressed her gratitude for Toni's support in coping with Pod's absence, and both shared a kiss after confessing their feelings for each other.[12]\nWhen A.I.M. became a branch of S.H.I.E.L.D. under the name ofAmerican Intelligence Mechanics, Toni joined the organization'sU.S.Avengers, undergoing a rebranding herself.

Not wanting to believe Norman Osborn could have succeeded where he failed, Kraven made his way toGovernors Island, where a spidery figure has been rumored to be sighted. As he prowled the grounds, he spotted a potential threat and attacked who turned out to beElectro. Deflecting Kraven's attack, Electro said that he was there to kill Spider-Man too, and when Kraven furiously snarled thathewould be the one to kill Spider-Man, Electro told him to get in line and pointed to theVulture,Doctor Octopus,Rhino, andLizard. Doctor Octopus stated that he lured Kraven to the island in the hopes of teaming up to hunt down Spider-Man, but Kraven refused until Doc Ock pointed out that they could find Spider-Man first. Begrudgingly agreeing to join them, Kraven called dibs on killing Spider-Man despite Electro pointing out that odds he was already dead. Offput by the prospect, as there was no honor in hunting already-slain prey, Kraven noted it would be a shame to waste such a perfect night... oblivious that they were being watched from the shadows of the mansion's interior by theVenom symbiote.[1]\nKraven savored the anticipation of the hunt, leading the Sinister Six towards the abandoned mansion. As theLizarddeclared his intent to devourSpider-Man, Kraven snapped that the killing blow was to be his. Thinking to himself that he preferred to hunt alone, Kraven compared the other members of the Sinister Six to decoys and stalking horses. Noting the tracks tell of a vicious battle where Spider-Man fought with a heretofore unknown cruelty, Kraven relished the thought of fighting such a foe and led the others towards the manor, where Spider-Man and theGreen Goblinhad their final battle. Approving of Doctor Octopus sending theVultureto do aerial reconnaissance, Kraven was annoyed byElectrosaying he could not hear any wildlife on the island, dismissing his concerns. The Vulture returned, reporting that he saw no signs of life, and Doctor Octopus split the party to surround the mansion and cut off any avenues of escape.[2]\nKraven was paired with Electro, who muttered that Doctor Octopus could be excessively dramatic, Kraven sneering that he could not care less about any of them. Entering the mansion, Kraven realized that this was where the final battle went down. Illuminating a passage with a bolt of electricity, Electro was shocked to see an empty suit ofGoblin Armorsuspended from webbing, noting that Spider-Man seemed to have won before wondering where Osborn's body was. Spotting a nearby skull gnawed clean of flesh and with the top bitten off, Kraven realized what happened to the Green Goblin and pulled out his hunting knives as a towering shadow loomed from behind them. A pair of white eyespots glared at them as the white spider emblem of Spider-Man's black suit emerged from the darkness, and as a fanged maw opened in a ravenous roar Kraven realized the monster before them was much more - and much worse - than Spider-Man ever was.[2]\nKraven andElectrorecoiled at the sight of thehulking black and white monstercrushing a pipe above them, a serpentine tongue snaking between its fanged jaws. Electro panicked and fired off a bolt of electricity, narrowly missing Kraven and causing the monster to flee. Furious, Kraven grabbed Electro by the shoulders and berated him, snapping that the monster wasSpider-Man. As Kraven left to follow the monster's trail, he thought to himself that while it did not look like Spider-Man it moved and smelled like him. As Electro protested that they had to warn the others,Doctor Octopusarrived and asked what they were talking about. Electro blurted out that they had found a monster that Kraven thought to be Spider-Man, Kraven grimly insisting that it was. Stating that he trusted Kraven more than Electro, Doctor Octopus asked which way their quarry had fled. As Kraven said it was headed to the roof, Doctor Octopus nonchalantly said that theVulturewas more than capable of holding his own. Following after Kraven, Electro grumbled that he had a bad feeling about this. Kraven snapped at them to shut up, glaring as he noted that they could never understand that the hunt required focus, discipline, and commitment.[3]\nArriving on the roof, the three villains found the Vulture in the claws of the monstrous Spider-Man, restrained by semi-amorphous tentacles extending from its body and crying for help as it tried to bite off his head. The monster bit out a huge chunk of the Vulture's neck, Electro covering his mouth in horror and Doctor Octopus gaping in shock as Kraven grimly noted that their prey had become a predator, changing the nature of the hunt. With a scream of fury, Doctor Octopus launched himself at the monstrous Spider-Man and tackled it off the roof, Kraven examining aviscous black oozeon the dying Vulture's body as Electro nervously asked what it was. Electro said that he was leaving and that if Kraven was smart he would leave too, but Kraven refused to abandon the hunt, elated by the thrill of a worthy opponent. As the monstrous Spider-Man overpowered him through sheer strength, Doctor Octopus panicked and called out for help; Kraven leaping off the roof and plunging his hunting knife into its back. Shrieking in rage and pain, the monster destabilized into flailing black tendrils, exposing Spider-Man. Coiling tendrils around Doctor Octopus' throat and trying to strangle him, the black ooze began to engulf Spider-Man once more as he begged his enemies to help him, Kraven noting that he finally understood and that things had gotten far more complicated than he had thought.[3]\nKraven noted that the world was a place of hunters and prey, but thatthe semi-amorphous black and white monsterformerly bonded toSpider-Manseemed to be a combination of both. Realizing that Spider-Man was the key to understanding it, Kraven moved to cut him free of the monster's tendrils to no avail, as it regenerated as soon as he slashed it. Drawing a comparison to the Lernean Hydra of Greek mythology, Kraven wondered if it had the same weakness and called out to the fleeingElectroto blast it. As the monster rose up into a semi-humanoid form, holding Spider-Man in one \"hand\" and the unconsciousDoctor Octopusin its other, Electro protested that doing so previously only made it angry. Kraven shouted at him to set the grass around the monster ablaze, and Electro reluctantly did so, forcing the monster to relinquish its grasp on Spider-Man. As Kraven caught the man he'd meant to hunt to death and carried him a safe distance away, Electro rejoiced just as theRhinoarrived and asked what's going on. Before Electro could reply, the monster furiously ensnared them with its tendrils and roared at them.[4]\nCradling Spider-Man, Kraven asked what they were up against and Spider-Man weakly replied that it was an aliensymbiotethat pretended to be his costume but took over his body, devouringGreen Goblinand many other people. Looking up to see that the symbiote had captured the other members of the Sinister Six and was about to devour them, Kraven noted that like himself it was a hunter. Realizing that Spider-Man had died, Kraven laid his nemesis' body to rest and called out to the symbiote, intent on succeeding where his would-be prey failed. Approaching the symbiote, Kraven offered himself as its new host, saying that the rest of the world could be their prey before amending his statement to include the other members of the Sinister Six, suggesting they form a pack to hunt together. The symbiote accepted and bonds to them, and the Sinister Six were reborn as the Symbiote Six.[4]"

Doctor Octopus stated that he lured Kraven to the island in the hopes of teaming up to hunt down Spider-Man, but Kraven refused until Doc Ock pointed out that they could find Spider-Man first. Begrudgingly agreeing to join them,[1]Kraven led the Sinister Six towards the abandoned mansion. As theLizarddeclared his intent to devourSpider-Man, Kraven snapped that the killing blow was to be his. TheRhinointerrupted, angrily saying they all wanted a piece of Spider-Man. Telling the others to stop bickering, Doctor Octopus assured them that there would be more than enough Spider-Man to go around. Doctor Octopus sent theVultureto do aerial reconnaissance, who reported no signs of life, and Doctor Octopus split the party to surround the mansion and cut off any avenues of escape. Kraven was paired with Electro to go inside, which Otto went to cover the rear exit.[2]\nWhen Kraven and Electro emerged back outside, Electro protested that they had to warn the others. Doctor Octopus arrived and asked what they were talking about. Electro blurted out that they had found a monster that Kraven thought to be Spider-Man, Kraven grimly insisting that it was. Stating that he trusted Kraven more than Electro, Doctor Octopus asked which way their quarry had fled. As Kraven said it was headed to the roof, Doctor Octopus nonchalantly said that theVulturewas more than capable of holding his own. Arriving on the roof, the three villains found the Vulture in the claws of the monstrous Spider-Man, restrained by semi-amorphous tentacles extending from its body and crying for help as it tried to bite off his head. The monster bit out a huge chunk of the Vulture's neck, Doctor Octopus gaping in shock as Kraven grimly noted that their prey had become a predator. With a scream of fury, Doctor Octopus launched himself at the monstrous Spider-Man and tackled it off the roof. As the monstrous Spider-Man overpowered him through sheer strength, Doctor Octopus panicked and called out for help; Kraven leaping off the roof and plunging his hunting knife into its back. Shrieking in rage and pain, the monster destabilized into flailing black tendrils, exposing Spider-Man. Coiling tendrils around Doctor Octopus' throat and trying to strangle him, the black ooze began to engulf Spider-Man once more as he begged his enemies to help him.[3]\nAs the monster rose up into a semi-humanoid form, holding Spider-Man in one \"hand\" and the unconscious Doctor Octopus in its other, Electro set the grass around the monster ablaze, forcing the monster to relinquish its grasp on Spider-Man. Realizing that Spider-Man had died, Kraven approached the symbiote, offering himself as its new host before amending his statement to include the other members of the Sinister Six, suggesting they form a pack to hunt together. The symbiote accepted and bonds to them, and the Sinister Six were reborn as the Symbiote Six.[4]"

As Carnage prepares to finish her off, Venom Space Knight formed an arm-blade and lunged forth, shouting for Carnage to get away from his daughter.

Anne Weying then said that she had a last Hail Mary play that required the others to do exactly as she says.[3]"

The objective of Dorrek was to shape this group of outcasts into heroes dedicated to uniting the two warring empires. As time passed, the Knights started believing in the prophecy that once the Skrull and the Kree empires fell, the Knights were destined to unify and protect the two empires, under the leadership of he who managed to take up Dorrek Supreme's sword,Excelsior, a feat that would prove him as the reincarnation of Dorrek Supreme.[1]The Knights eyed the first royal hybrid in thousands of years,Dorrek VIII, known to Earthers as the super heroHulkling.[2]\nFollowing the destruction of the Kree capital planetHala, the Knights were anxious to recruit Dorrek VIII to become their king. However, the elderM'ryn the Magus, who had created the prophecy, tried to postpone its fulfillment, because another part of the prophecy he maintained secret from the Knights involved his death. The Knights decided to part anyways, and they travelled to Earth and kidnapped Hulkling, and his boyfriendWiccanby accident. The Knights returned to their base of operations, the Forbidden Asteroids, apologized for the kidnapping, and showed Hulkling the test he had to pass in order to see if he was truly the chosen one: pulling Excelsior from a stone. Hulkling passed the test, and the Knights kneeled before him.[2]\nWhen the Knights returned to their home,Castle Tarnala, they discovered the corpse of M'ryn possessed by the evil wizardMoridun. Any attempts at damaging Moridun were in vain, and the creature soon absorbed enough power to grow in size, destroying the castle from the inside out. Hulkling and Wiccan's teammates, theNew Avengers, joined the brawl against Moridun, to no avail. After accidentally absorbing an energy blast from Moridun with Excelsior, he realized he could use it against Moridun. The New Avengers distracted Moridun long enough to allow Hulkling to stab him in the face, seemingly killing the creature."

They used a combination of science and magic in an attempt to create a vessel for the demonicMephicthton. After their twenty-second attempt had failed, Sarah posed the theory that they needed to stop trying to create a perfect specimen, but instead make something flawed. To this end, Sarah herself decided to conceive their next subject. Combining their best enchantments and enhancements, Sarah was impregnated and gave birth to amutantgirl, whom Sarah namedLaura.\nSarah nurtured Laura's humanity, much to Herbert's chagrin, since he only saw their daughter as an object to prepare to become a vessel. The following years, Wyndham had Laura train underHellhound's tutelage to become a perfect assassin, Weapon Hex. When Laura was eighteen years old, Herbert decided to make the preparations for the ritual to have Laura contain Mephicthton. Fearing for Laura's safety, Sarah tried to escape with her. Wyndham used a triggering spell to mark Sarah as a target for Laura, causing her to mindlessly kill her.[2]\nWeapon Hex rampaged through the Evolutionaries' Keep to find her secret clone/sisterSpeed Weasel, whose existence Sarah had revealed to Laura with her last breath. Herbert and Hellhound intercepted them when they prepared to escape, and Wyndham decided to use Speed Weasel as the vessel instead. Wyndham proceeded with the ritual, and pulverized Weapon Hex with a magic lightning after Laura had killed Hellhound. Laura returned to life, and called upon the spirits of all that died as a result of Wyndham's plans. The ghouls mauled Wyndham to death while Laura broke Speed Weasel free from Mephicthton's influence.[3]\nWeapon Hex accessed the memories of theMad Ghostafter she plunged her claws into his head. She witnessed her father Herbert making a deal with Kragoff concerning the kidnapping of her sister. Herbert was shown to have been still aligned with Mephicthton in the afterlife to be part of his inner circle against theDefenders. Herbert's end goal was for his daughter to still become the host for his master so he, along withDormammu Red,Deathstrique, andStane Odinsonput a plan into play to have the Defenders fight among themselves allowing Herbert and the others to advance in their war against the living.[1]"

Doctor Octopus stated that he lured Kraven to the island in the hopes of teaming up to hunt down Spider-Man. Begrudgingly agreeing to join them,[1]Kraven led the Sinister Six towards the abandoned mansion. Doctor Octopus split the party to surround the mansion and cut off any avenues of escape.[2]\nThey found Spider-Man enveloped by ahulking black and white symbiote. Just as the Rhino arrived and asked what's going on, the monster furiously ensnared him and Electro with its tendrils and roared at them. Realizing that Spider-Man had died, Kraven approached the symbiote, offering himself as its new host before amending his statement to include the other members of the Sinister Six, suggesting they form a pack to hunt together. The symbiote accepted and bonds to them, and the Sinister Six were reborn as the Symbiote Six.[3]\nArriving to this reality on a quest to purge itself of weaknesses, theCarnage SymbioteofEarth-616killed the Venomized Electro, absorbing his powers. It was then confronted by the Symbiote Six, who declared their intent to avenge their fallen comrade.[4]Carnage-616 mocked the five remaining members of the Symbiote Six, saying it found them so pathetic it would not even absorb their powers like it didElectro's. Deciding to test its newHell-Mark, Carnage summoned the Monsters of Evil and sicced them on the Symbiote Six, easily overpowering them. Carnage then slaughtered Venomized Lizard, Vulture, Kraven and Doctor Octopus. Venomized Rhino, the sole surviving member of the Symbiote Six, volunteered to joinAgent Venom's Symbiote Squad in exchange for a shot at avenging his fallen comrades.[5]\nThey portaled toEarth-53232where Carnage was fightingChaos Engine. Venomized Rhino impaled it on his horn, but Carnage picked itself up and sneered that such a devastating blow might've done it in if it'd been bonded to a host.Virusportaled in others to join the fray, Venomized Rhino blocking Carnage's attempt to impale Chaos Engine with flinger-tentacles.Agent Deadpoolwas bisected by an arm-blade, andVenomized Black Catwas fatally impaled, and Carnage lunged at Virus, intent on depriving the Symbiote Squad of their sonics and means of interdimensional travel. Agent Venom ordered the others to grab Chaos Engine and evacuate.[5]After recruitingSilence/Andi BentonofEarth-616, the Symbiote Squad arrived to a universe at the gates of a golden medieval-looking city.Dreamstone Venomsaid that they were looking atAsgard, and Venomized Rhino expressed awe at being in the realm of the Norse gods.Venom Space Knightsaid that they were on Earth, which Dreamstone Venom noted must have joined Asgard to recover fromWar of the Realms. Glaring at a group of alarmed civilians, Rhino scoffed that it did not seem much different to his own Earth.[6]\nImpaling Carnage\nThey were ambushed by Carnage, whom they were prepared to fight with Anti-Venom and Anti-Carnage. Carnage immolated Anti-Carnage with hellfire and assimilated his symbiote, but then doubled over with a scream of pain as all the symbiotes it had absorbed began bursting out of it.[6]Rhino amazedly remarked that all the people Carnage killed have been resurrected, butSymbioteSpider-Manpointed to the red vein-like markings covering their bodies and said that their codexes have incarnated using Carnage and Anti-Carnage's matter. Rhino rammed Carnage, spattering it like a bug on a windshield. Venomized Rhino and Venom charged Carnage to buy the others time to evacuate, but it scornfully backhanded Venom away and vomited a torrent of hellfire that stopped Venomized Rhino cold. Before Carnage could finish them off,Dylan Brockactivated the Virus armor's dimensional portal and warped himself and the survivors to safety.[7]"

Maverick worked forProject: Troubleshooter, theUnited States' latest off-the-books facility for the production of human weapons. He oversaw the procedure that turnedCorporal Todd Zillerinto a giant lizard monster, who would be nicknamed \"American Kaiju\" by Maverick.[5]\nWhenAvengers Idea Mechanicsperformed an illegal operation to rescueRick JonesfromS.H.I.E.L.D.custody, Maverick suggested to retaliate with the American Kaiju.[6]Maverick later observed as the American Kaiju was deployed against A.I.M. and witnessed as it was defeated and reverted back to his human form.[7]\nSome time later, when A.I.M.'s leaderBobby Da Costadefeated the villainousMaker, he decided to bring him to the United States' government and for Maverick to be in their good graces and motivate cooperation between them.[8]Da Costa's alliance with Maverick resulted in A.I.M. being absorbed by S.H.I.E.L.D. and working with the American government, having becomeAmerican Intelligence Mechanics.[8]With the rebranding of A.I.M., Maverick became a member of itsU.S.Avengers. Using an improved version of S.H.I.E.L.D.'sHulk Plug-Ins, Maverick became the newRed Hulk.[2]\nThe time-limit imposed by the Hulk Plug-In power caused Maverick to feel feeble. AHydradouble-agent namedKyleworking within A.I.M. took advantage of this to offer Robert a nanite injection that could bypass the safety cutout.[9]The nanites also allowed Hydra to take control of Red Hulk's body,[10]forcing him to do their bidding and spent Hulked-out for the entirety of their short-lived reign in control of the United States.[11]Even though da Costa burned the nanites from Maverick's blood,[12]the nanites prevented him from turning back. Additionally, he had remained in Red Hulk state for roughly 800 times longer than he should've.\nMaverick's human form after having overtaxed\nFollowing Hydra's defeat, Maverick underwent a painful and long process to revert back to his regular form because he couldn't remain as the Red Hulk due to pressing health concerns. Robert emerged from the procedure with heart damage, bone density loss, muscle tearing, high blood pressure and with his skin's pigment being permanently red.[13]Maverick could still access to the Hulk Plug-In, but making use of it wasn't recommendable.[14]\nWhen the different teams of Avengers were caught in the middle of a contest between theGrandmaster'sLethal Legionand theChallenger'sBlack Order, the Red Hulk was part of a group of Avengers deployed inPeruto investigate a fight between the competing teams to seize aPyramoid.[15]Maverick tried to claim the Pyramoid himself, but was beaten by theHuman Torch.[16]Luckily for Maverick, whoever touched a Pyramoid was teleported away in such a manner it looked like they were disintegrated.[17]\nRed Hulk's final stand\nAs soon as his Hulk Plug-In gave in, Red Hulk was benched and retreated to theAvengers Auxiliary Headquarters.[18]The final Pyramoid was teleported to the Auxiliary Headquarters by the Avengers infiltrator and the Grandmaster's secret player,Voyager, who locked herself in a safe room with it. When the resurrectedHulkattacked the Auxiliary HQ on behalf of the Challenger to claim the Pyramoid in Voyager's possession, Red Hulk faced him sportingToni Ho'sIron Patriot Armor.[4]Maverick barely managed to fend off the Hulk, and was rather quickly overpowered. The Hulk drained all of the gamma energy from the Hulk Plug-In, additionally returning Robert his original skin tone. TheVisionmanaged to distract the Hulk, givingQuicksilverenough time to step into the scene and take Maverick to safety.[19]\nHulk Plug-In:Maverick has an implant in his left arm that allows him to transform into a Hulk for one hour every day and a half, approximately.[2]However, since this plug-in device was re-modified by Agent Kyle (who secretly was a Hydra double-agent), it seems that now he can stay in a Hulk form more than one hour.[21]This grants him the following abilities:\nHulk Plug-In:A wrist-mounted, surgically implanted device that allows Maverick to gain Hulk-like powers.[2]"

Sarah treated her daughter the opposite way, fostering Laura's humanity and empathy, whereas Wyndham regarded her as an object who had evolved past such values.[1]Afraid that Laura could lose herself, Sarah created a younger clone of her, the speedsterGavrill, to anchor Laura to her humanity if necessary. Sarah kept Gavrill's existence a secret from everybody except her handmaidBavel.[2]When Laura was eighteen years old, Herbert decided to make the preparations for the ritual to have Laura contain Mephicthton. Fearing for Laura's safety, Sarah tried to escape with her. Wyndham used a triggering spell to mark Sarah as a target for Laura, causing her to mindlessly kill her. Aware that Laura didn't intend to injure her, Sarah used her dying breath to forgive Laura and reveal the existence of Gavrill.[1]"

Hulkling easily pulled off the sword, and he was deemed king of the Knights.[5]\nThe sword was used by Hulkling to defeat the evil wizardMoridun the Mage, and Dorrek kept it even after leaving the Knights.[3]Hulkling has continued to use the sword during missions including defeatingCelestial Destructor,[9]vanishingPaibokand theNew Revengers,[10]and battlingDark Elvesduring theWar of the Realms.[11]\nBlack Pantherusing the Star-Sword to slaySwordsmanand destroy theDeath Blossom\nTo defend theGreat MoundinWakandafrom the attack of theCotati, the newly crowned Emperor Hulkling lent Excelsior to theBlack Panther.[12]With the Star-Sword, Black Panther slew many Cotati warriors and fought one-on-one withSwordsmanbefore ultimately destroying theDeath Blossom. Having completed his plans, Black Panther sent the Star-Sword back to Hulkling.[13]\nWhen theProgenitorsattackedThroneworld II, Emperor Hulkling slew of the Progenitors singlehandedly with Excelsior. Because Excelsior can disrupt magic, a well placed stab from the sword was all it took to topple the giant.[1]\nSensing the rise ofsomethingthat would shift the balance of all things,Doctor Doomarrived on Throneworld II to take Excelsior from Emperor Hulkling by force. When it became apparent that Excelsior was loyal only to Hulkling, Doom swapped bodies with him. Fortunately,Moondragonwas able to reverse the effects and temporarily trapped Doom inRocket's body.[7]\nShattered by aMindless Ones' energy blast\nDisrupting the magic of theProgenitors\nExcelsior has potent magical powers being an amalgam of two mystical swords of Kree and Skrull origins. As it stands all of its supposed abilities are vague but the few to name off are as follows:\nKing Hulk, alongside other heroes, used his sword to finally killThanosfor good.\nKing Hulkwasn't seen using Excelsior, but after his reality was changed the sword was seen sitting inside an umbrella holder."

Gemma begrudgingly obliges, complaining to herself about her male colleagues' sexism under her breath. When her order is called, Gemma collects the coffee and steps out the door to see the sky is pitch-black and the city is swarming withSymbiote Dragons.\nIn the present, Gemma is snapped out of her reminiscing byArthur Krane, who places a cup of coffee in front of her and says he got it just how she likes it. Smiling, Gemma thanks him and Arthur apologizes for how overworked she is on account of Senator Krane's upcomingFriends of Humanityrally. Gemma shrugs it off, saying it comes with the territory of being Krane's chief communications officer, and Arthur comments that he thinks she's doing an amazing job despite her work being under-appreciated. Arthur suggests she do something to cut loose and enjoy herself, Gemma smiling as she says she hasn't gone for a run in a long time.\nLater,Flash Thompson,Andi Benton, andBren Waterswalk through the National Mall, pointedly ignoring a Friends of Humanity supporter trying to recruit them. As Andi comments in disgust on the sheer amount of Friends of Humanity propaganda, Flash suggests they rendezvous withHankand see what he knows of Senator Krane's plans. Glancing at a poster the recruiter gave him, Bren asks if people really believe such hateful things, and Flash explains that when people are scared they latch onto information that comforts them - even if that information is misleading or false, which makes them susceptible to charismatic demagogues like Senator Krane. Out for her jog, Gemma unwittingly runs past them.\nLater that night, Gemma jogs through the city and is accosted by a trio of street thugs, who pull knives on her and threateningly tells her to smile for them. Grinning wickedly, Gemma transforms intoAgonyand douses two of the thugs with a torrent of acid, roaring as she decapitates two with slashes from her claws. Grabbing the surviving thug by the neck, she licks his face - burning a furrow into his cheek with her corrosive saliva - and mocking tells him to smile for her before chomping into his head. Sighing contentedly, Gemma retracts the Agony symbiote from her head and wipes a bit of brain from her cheek, commenting that Arthur was right and she feels much better now.\nThe next day, Gemma comes into the office looking refreshed and some of her coworkers sneer that she must have had sex, asking if the \"Ice Queen\" gave her lover frostbite. Arthur glares at the men and calls them disgusting, but Gemma brushes off their sexism and steps into the break room to get some coffee. Following, Arthur says he strongly disapproves of how his father runs things and confides that he's considering running against him in the future. Intrigued, Gemma smirks and pours him a mug of coffee, Arthur asking if she would consider coming to work for him. Toasting him, Gemma says she would like that.\nMeeting with Hank in an apartment, Flash asks for the soldier-turned-bodyguard to fill him in on what he knows. Grinning, Hank comments that Senator Krane doesn't suspect he's a spy, letting him obtain all sorts of secretive details due to being considered unimportant; filling them in that Senator Krane is plotting to hijack the President's memorial speech for the people killed during Knull's invasion. Rolling her eyes, Andi comments that evenCarnagewouldn't seriously consider trying to assassinate the President in broad daylight, but Flash sternly says that he absolutely does and will do so if nobody stops him. Bren curses out loud, Flash concurring before saying the public murder of the President will throw the country into chaos -- in keeping with Carnage's usual MO. Horrified, Hank asks if Flash is serious about Senator Krane being Carnage, then asks if Flash and his accomplices have symbiotes as well. Flash apologizes for not letting Hank know sooner, saying he wanted to keep him safe. Grumbling that he's not feeling very safe between the assassination plot and finding out his new boss is being puppeteered by Carnage, Hank asks how Flash plans to stop him. Turning to Andi, Flash says that herSilence symbioteis their ace in the hole and asks if she can sense Carnage andhis Hivenow that they're closer. Closing her eyes and concentrating, Andi transforms into Silence and says that ever since their meeting with Toxin she's been worried that tapping into the Hive-Mind is a two-way street; noting that she'll try anyway and that she can sense someone.\nAt her apartment, which is decorated with dismembered and mutilated body parts, Gemma hangs the severed arm of one of the thugs above her television and eyes it contemplatively, asking the Agony symbiote if it thinks the arm looks good on their mantleplace. Mimicking her, the Agony symbiote says they don't have a mantle to hang it over, Gemma saying that she meant the space on the wall. Eyeing it, Gemma says she thinks it looks tacky, but the Agony symbiote says it looks perfect. Commenting that she thinks something's missing, Gemma chastizes the Agony symbiote for eating the thug's other arm - preventing them from having a matching set, before cheerfully patting it on the head and saying she's not mad and that they'll just have to get another. Pulling them into the Hive-Mind, Carnage comments that he loves what she's done with her apartment, Gemma irritibly snaps that she told him she didn't want to be contacted outside of work hours. Quipping it's happy hour and time for some team bonding, Carnage conjures a bartop and morphshis symbioteto look like a bartender, telling Gemma to take a seat as he summons the other symbiotes under his command. The Agony symbiote transforming into a purple dress, Gemma sits betweenPhage- having assumeda canine form- andRiot, ordering a gin and tonic. As Carnage says he'll oblige and mixes a drink, Gemma glances at Phage,Lasher,Scream, and the other assembled symbiotes and comments that if this meeting is about the big event they're missing a few recruits. Pouring red ooze into a cocktail glass, Carnage replies that if she's talking about Silence andToxin, they'll be there.\nInfiltrating the Hive-Mind, Silence notes that Carnage and all the Life Foundation symbiotes are there, but that she's too far away to hear what they're saying. As she flies closer, Carnage says that with what he has planned there's no way they'll be able to stay way; revealing he's aware that Andi's there and impaling her in the chest with a tendril, causing the Silence symbiote to manifest a fanged maw and roar in pain. Disconnecting from the Hive-Mind, Andi tells Flash that Carnage knows they're coming. Transforming intoAgent Anti-Venom, Flash says they may have lost the element of surprise but that at least they know Carnage is expecting them, Bren transforming into Toxin. As Silence, Toxin, and Agent Anti-Venom set out, Hank calls out asking what he should do given he lacks a symbiote of his own; Agent Anti-Venom telling him to not let the President out of his sight and telling his allies to be careful.\nIn the Hive-Mind, Gemma eyeballs the drink and notes that it's not a gin and tonic, Carnage cheerfully admitting he has no clue how to make one anyway. As Carnage asks if she's having second thoughts regarding their alliance, Gemma scoffs and takes the drink -- telling him not to forget the promise he made to her and the Agony symbiote. Saying he'd never do so, Carnage pours a glass of his own and toasts the Hive.\nThe next day, Agent Anti-Venom, Silence, and Toxin watch the President's memorial speech from a distance. Hank warily watches as Gemma tells Senator Krane it's time to hijack the show, Senator Krane walking out to cheers from his adoring fans. As Arthur congratulates everyone on a job well-done and Gemma assures \"Mr. Riot\" that all the pieces are in place, the three turn to stare ominously at Hank. Calling Flash, Hank informs him that Senator Krane is about to begin his speech, noting that he doesn't see any of the Life Foundation symbiotes orAlchemax'sGuardsmen. Pondering the situation, Flash realizes that they've got everything wrong as Hank is suddenly impaled from behind by a red-and-black blade, Arthur Krane unveiling himself as Carnage's host. Taking his phone, Carnage mockingly apologizes for cutting him off before turning to Agony, Riot, and Phage, saying they're on a tight schedule and have a speech to catch.\nENTER: AGONY!"

Gemma accede a regañadientes, quejándose en voz baja del sexismo de sus colegas masculinos. Cuando la llaman, Gemma recoge el café y sale por la puerta para ver que el cielo está muy oscuro y la ciudad está plagada deDragones Simbiontes.\nEn el presente, Gemma es sacada de sus recuerdos porArthur Krane, que le pone una taza de café delante y le dice que lo tiene como a ella le gusta. Sonriendo, Gemma le da las gracias y Arthur se disculpa por el exceso de trabajo que tiene a causa del próximo mitin deAmigos de la Humanidad. Gemma se encoge de hombros, diciendo que es algo que viene de la mano de ser la jefa de comunicaciones de Krane, y Arthur comenta que cree que está haciendo un trabajo increíble a pesar de que su trabajo es poco apreciado. Arthur le sugiere que haga algo para soltarse y divertirse, y Gemma sonríe mientras dice que no ha salido a correr en mucho tiempo.\nMás tarde,Flash Thompson,Andi BentonyBren Waterscaminan por el National Mall, ignorando deliberadamente a un partidario de Amigos de la Humanidad que intenta reclutarlos. Mientras Andi comenta con disgusto la gran cantidad de propaganda de Amigos de la Humanidad, Flash sugiere que se reúnan conHanky vean lo que sabe de los planes del senador Krane. Mirando un póster que le dio el reclutador, Bren pregunta si la gente realmente cree en cosas tan odiosas, y Flash explica que cuando la gente está asustada se aferra a la información que la reconforta, incluso si esa información es engañosa o falsa, lo que la hace susceptible a demagogos carismáticos como el senador Krane. Al salir a correr, Gemma se cruza con ellos sin darse cuenta.\nMás tarde, esa misma noche, Gemma hace footing por la ciudad y es abordada por un trío de matones callejeros, que la apuntan con cuchillos y la amenazan diciéndole que sonría para ellos. Con una sonrisa malvada, Gemma se transforma enAgonyy rocía a dos de los matones con un torrente de ácido, rugiendo mientras decapita a dos con los cortes de sus garras. Agarrando al matón superviviente por el cuello, le lame la cara -quemando un surco en su mejilla con su saliva corrosiva- y le dice burlonamente que sonría para ella antes de morderle la cabeza. Suspirando satisfecha, Gemma retira el simbionte Agony de su cabeza y se limpia un poco de cerebro de su mejilla, comentando que Arthur tenía razón y que ahora se siente mucho mejor.\nAl día siguiente, Gemma llega a la oficina con un aspecto renovado y algunos de sus compañeros de trabajo se mofan de que debe de haber tenido sexo, preguntando si la \"Reina del Hielo\" ha congelado a su amante. Arthur mira a los hombres y los llama asquerosos, pero Gemma se desentiende de su sexismo y va a la sala de descanso a por un café. A continuación, Arthur dice que desaprueba firmemente la forma en que su padre dirige las cosas y confiesa que está considerando presentarse contra él en el futuro. Intrigada, Gemma sonríe y le sirve una taza de café, y Arthur le pregunta si consideraría ir a trabajar para él. Brindando por él, Gemma dice que le gustaría.\nReunido con Hank en un apartamento, Flash pide al soldado convertido en guardaespaldas que le ponga al corriente de lo que sabe. Sonriendo, Hank comenta que el senador Krane no sospecha que es un espía, lo que le permite obtener todo tipo de detalles secretos debido a que se le considera poco importante; informándole de que el senador Krane está conspirando para secuestrar el discurso del presidente en memoria de los muertos durante la invasión de Knull. Poniendo los ojos en blanco, Andi comenta que ni siquieraCarnageconsideraría seriamente la posibilidad de intentar asesinar al Presidente a plena luz del día, pero Flash le dice con firmeza que sí y que lo hará si nadie lo detiene. Bren maldice en voz alta, y Flash coincide antes de decir que el asesinato público del Presidente sumirá al país en el caos, de acuerdo con el modus operandi habitual de Carnage. Horrorizado, Hank pregunta si Flash habla en serio sobre que el senador Krane es Carnage, y luego pregunta si Flash y sus cómplices también tienen simbiontes. Flash se disculpa por no haber avisado a Hank antes, diciendo que quería mantenerlo a salvo. Refunfuñando que no se siente muy seguro entre el complot de asesinato y el descubrimiento de que su nuevo jefe está siendo titiritado por Carnage, Hank pregunta cómo planea Flash detenerlo. Dirigiéndose a Andi, Flash le dice que susimbionte Silencioes su as en la manga y le pregunta si puede sentir a Carnage y asu Colmenaahora que están más cerca. Cerrando los ojos y concentrándose, Andi se transforma en Silencio y dice que desde su encuentro con Toxin le preocupa que el acceso a la Mente-Colmena sea una vía de doble sentido; señalando que lo intentará de todas formas y que puede sentir a alguien.\nEn su apartamento, que está decorado con partes de cuerpos desmembrados y mutilados, Gemma cuelga el brazo cortado de uno de los matones encima de su televisión y lo observa contemplativamente, preguntando al simbionte Agony si cree que el brazo queda bien en su chimenea. Imitándola, el simbionte de Agony dice que no tienen una chimenea para colgarlo, y Gemma dice que se refiere al espacio de la pared. Gemma dice que cree que es una horterada, pero el simbionte de Agony dice que es perfecto. Comentando que cree que falta algo, Gemma reprende al simbionte de Agony por haberse comido el otro brazo del matón, impidiendo que tengan un conjunto a juego, antes de darle una alegre palmadita en la cabeza y decir que no está enfadada y que tendrán que conseguir otro. Al llevarlos a la Mente-Colmena, Carnage comenta que le encanta lo que ha hecho con su apartamento, y Gemma le dice irritada que le dijo que no quería que la contactaran fuera del horario de trabajo. Tras decir que es la hora de la felicidad y que es hora de unir al equipo, Carnage conjura una barra de bar y transforma asu simbionteen un camarero, diciéndole a Gemma que tome asiento mientras convoca a los demás simbiontes bajo su mando. El simbionte Agony se transforma en un vestido púrpura, Gemma se sienta entrePhage- habiendo asumidouna forma canina- yRiot, pidiendo un gin-tonic. Mientras Carnage dice que lo complacerá y mezcla una bebida, Gemma mira a Phage,Lasher,Scream, y a los demás simbiontes reunidos y comenta que si esta reunión es sobre el gran evento les faltan algunos reclutas. Vertiendo exudado rojo en una copa de cóctel, Carnage responde que si está hablando de Silencio yToxin, estarán allí.\nAl infiltrarse en la Mente-Colmena, Silencio observa que Carnage y todos los simbiontes de la Fundación Vida están allí, pero que ella está demasiado lejos para oír lo que dicen. Mientras vuela más cerca, Carnage dice que con lo que ha planeado no habrá forma de que se queden así; revela que es consciente de que Andi está allí y la empala en el pecho con un zarcillo, lo que hace que el simbionte de Silencio manifieste unas fauces con colmillos y ruge de dolor. Al desconectarse de la Mente-Colmena, Andi le dice a Flash que Carnage sabe que vienen. Transformándose enAgente Anti-Venom, Flash dice que puede que hayan perdido el elemento sorpresa pero que al menos saben que Carnage les espera, transformándose Bren en Toxin. Mientras Silencio, Toxin y el Agente Anti-Venom se ponen en marcha, Hank llama preguntando qué debe hacer dado que carece de un simbionte propio; el Agente Anti-Venom le dice que no pierda de vista al Presidente y les dice a sus aliados que tengan cuidado.\nEn la Mente-Colmena, Gemma mira la bebida y observa que no es un gin-tonic, y Carnage admite alegremente que no tiene ni idea de cómo hacer uno. Cuando Carnage le pregunta si se está replanteando su alianza, Gemma se burla y toma la bebida, diciéndole que no olvide la promesa que le hizo a ella y al simbionte Agony. Diciendo que nunca lo haría, Carnage se sirve una copa y brinda por la Colmena.\nAl día siguiente, el Agente Anti-Venom, Silencio y Toxin observan el discurso conmemorativo del Presidente desde la distancia. Hank observa con cautela cómo Gemma le dice al senador Krane que es hora de secuestrar el programa, y el senador Krane sale entre los vítores de sus adoradores. Mientras Arthur felicita a todos por un trabajo bien hecho y Gemma asegura al \"Sr. Motín\" que todas las piezas están en su sitio, los tres se vuelven para mirar ominosamente a Hank. Llamando a Flash, Hank le informa de que el senador Krane está a punto de comenzar su discurso, señalando que no ve a ninguno de los simbiontes de la Fundación Vida ni a losGuardiasde Alchemax. Reflexionando sobre la situación, Flash se da cuenta de que lo han entendido todo mal cuando Hank es repentinamente empalado por detrás por una hoja roja y negra, Arthur Krane desvelándose como el anfitrión deCarnage. Cogiendo su teléfono, Carnage se disculpa burlonamente por haberle cortado el paso antes de dirigirse a Agony, Disturbios y Fago, diciendo que tienen una agenda apretada y que tienen que coger un discurso.\nENTRA: ¡AGONY!\nMientras las probabilidades (¡y los simbiontes!) se acumulan en contra de nuestros héroes, ¿hay alguna manera de que puedan ganar contra Carnage"

Gemma begrudgingly obliges, complaining to herself about her male colleagues' sexism under her breath. When her order is called, Gemma collects the coffee and steps out the door to see the sky is pitch-black and the city is swarming withSymbiote Dragons.\nIn the present, Gemma is snapped out of her reminiscing byArthur Krane, who places a cup of coffee in front of her and says he got it just how she likes it. Smiling, Gemma thanks him and Arthur apologizes for how overworked she is on account of Senator Krane's upcomingFriends of Humanityrally. Gemma shrugs it off, saying it comes with the territory of being Krane's chief communications officer, and Arthur comments that he thinks she's doing an amazing job despite her work being under-appreciated. Arthur suggests she do something to cut loose and enjoy herself, Gemma smiling as she says she hasn't gone for a run in a long time.\nLater,Flash Thompson,Andi Benton, andBren Waterswalk through the National Mall, pointedly ignoring a Friends of Humanity supporter trying to recruit them. As Andi comments in disgust on the sheer amount of Friends of Humanity propaganda, Flash suggests they rendezvous withHankand see what he knows of Senator Krane's plans. Glancing at a poster the recruiter gave him, Bren asks if people really believe such hateful things, and Flash explains that when people are scared they latch onto information that comforts them - even if that information is misleading or false, which makes them susceptible to charismatic demagogues like Senator Krane. Out for her jog, Gemma unwittingly runs past them.\nLater that night, Gemma jogs through the city and is accosted by a trio of street thugs, who pull knives on her and threateningly tells her to smile for them. Grinning wickedly, Gemma transforms intoAgonyand douses two of the thugs with a torrent of acid, roaring as she decapitates two with slashes from her claws. Grabbing the surviving thug by the neck, she licks his face - burning a furrow into his cheek with her corrosive saliva - and mocking tells him to smile for her before chomping into his head. Sighing contentedly, Gemma retracts the Agony symbiote from her head and wipes a bit of brain from her cheek, commenting that Arthur was right and she feels much better now.\nThe next day, Gemma comes into the office looking refreshed and some of her coworkers sneer that she must have had sex, asking if the \"Ice Queen\" gave her lover frostbite. Arthur glares at the men and calls them disgusting, but Gemma brushes off their sexism and steps into the break room to get some coffee. Following, Arthur says he strongly disapproves of how his father runs things and confides that he's considering running against him in the future. Intrigued, Gemma smirks and pours him a mug of coffee, Arthur asking if she would consider coming to work for him. Toasting him, Gemma says she would like that.\nMeeting with Hank in an apartment, Flash asks for the soldier-turned-bodyguard to fill him in on what he knows. Grinning, Hank comments that Senator Krane doesn't suspect he's a spy, letting him obtain all sorts of secretive details due to being considered unimportant; filling them in that Senator Krane is plotting to hijack the President's memorial speech for the people killed during Knull's invasion. Rolling her eyes, Andi comments that evenCarnagewouldn't seriously consider trying to assassinate the President in broad daylight, but Flash sternly says that he absolutely does and will do so if nobody stops him. Bren curses out loud, Flash concurring before saying the public murder of the President will throw the country into chaos -- in keeping with Carnage's usual MO. Horrified, Hank asks if Flash is serious about Senator Krane being Carnage, then asks if Flash and his accomplices have symbiotes as well. Flash apologizes for not letting Hank know sooner, saying he wanted to keep him safe. Grumbling that he's not feeling very safe between the assassination plot and finding out his new boss is being puppeteered by Carnage, Hank asks how Flash plans to stop him. Turning to Andi, Flash says that herSilence symbioteis their ace in the hole and asks if she can sense Carnage andhis Hivenow that they're closer. Closing her eyes and concentrating, Andi transforms into Silence and says that ever since their meeting with Toxin she's been worried that tapping into the Hive-Mind is a two-way street; noting that she'll try anyway and that she can sense someone.\nAt her apartment, which is decorated with dismembered and mutilated body parts, Gemma hangs the severed arm of one of the thugs above her television and eyes it contemplatively, asking the Agony symbiote if it thinks the arm looks good on their mantleplace. Mimicking her, the Agony symbiote says they don't have a mantle to hang it over, Gemma saying that she meant the space on the wall. Eyeing it, Gemma says she thinks it looks tacky, but the Agony symbiote says it looks perfect. Commenting that she thinks something's missing, Gemma chastizes the Agony symbiote for eating the thug's other arm - preventing them from having a matching set, before cheerfully patting it on the head and saying she's not mad and that they'll just have to get another. Pulling them into the Hive-Mind, Carnage comments that he loves what she's done with her apartment, Gemma irritibly snaps that she told him she didn't want to be contacted outside of work hours. Quipping it's happy hour and time for some team bonding, Carnage conjures a bartop and morphshis symbioteto look like a bartender, telling Gemma to take a seat as he summons the other symbiotes under his command. The Agony symbiote transforming into a purple dress, Gemma sits betweenPhage- having assumeda canine form- andRiot, ordering a gin and tonic. As Carnage says he'll oblige and mixes a drink, Gemma glances at Phage,Lasher,Scream, and the other assembled symbiotes and comments that if this meeting is about the big event they're missing a few recruits. Pouring red ooze into a cocktail glass, Carnage replies that if she's talking about Silence andToxin, they'll be there.\nInfiltrating the Hive-Mind, Silence notes that Carnage and all the Life Foundation symbiotes are there, but that she's too far away to hear what they're saying. As she flies closer, Carnage says that with what he has planned there's no way they'll be able to stay way; revealing he's aware that Andi's there and impaling her in the chest with a tendril, causing the Silence symbiote to manifest a fanged maw and roar in pain. Disconnecting from the Hive-Mind, Andi tells Flash that Carnage knows they're coming. Transforming intoAgent Anti-Venom, Flash says they may have lost the element of surprise but that at least they know Carnage is expecting them, Bren transforming into Toxin. As Silence, Toxin, and Agent Anti-Venom set out, Hank calls out asking what he should do given he lacks a symbiote of his own; Agent Anti-Venom telling him to not let the President out of his sight and telling his allies to be careful.\nIn the Hive-Mind, Gemma eyeballs the drink and notes that it's not a gin and tonic, Carnage cheerfully admitting he has no clue how to make one anyway. As Carnage asks if she's having second thoughts regarding their alliance, Gemma scoffs and takes the drink -- telling him not to forget the promise he made to her and the Agony symbiote. Saying he'd never do so, Carnage pours a glass of his own and toasts the Hive.\nThe next day, Agent Anti-Venom, Silence, and Toxin watch the President's memorial speech from a distance. Hank warily watches as Gemma tells Senator Krane it's time to hijack the show, Senator Krane walking out to cheers from his adoring fans. As Arthur congratulates everyone on a job well-done and Gemma assures \"Mr. Riot\" that all the pieces are in place, the three turn to stare ominously at Hank. Calling Flash, Hank informs him that Senator Krane is about to begin his speech, noting that he doesn't see any of the Life Foundation symbiotes orAlchemax'sGuardsmen. Pondering the situation, Flash realizes that they've got everything wrong as Hank is suddenly impaled from behind by a red-and-black blade, Arthur Krane unveiling himself as Carnage's host. Taking his phone, Carnage mockingly apologizes for cutting him off before turning to Agony, Riot, and Phage, saying they're on a tight schedule and have a speech to catch.\nENTER: AGONY!"

Speaking mentally, Toxin sneers at Senator Krane's support of the xenophobicFriends of Humanitybefore noting that something about him doesn't feel right - each word pulsing like a drumbeat in its mind. Ozkar retorts that he doesn't need some politician to tell him who or what to be afraid of, though he states that in the wake ofrecent eventsKrane has a point that aliens are dangerous. Bren probes for more details about his father's job at Alchemax, but Ozkar reprimands Bren to wait until he has a job before criticizing how the bills are paid. Toxin scoffs that Bren has a lousy father, though it admits its own parent is exponentially worse.\nA few weeks later, having seen on the news thatAlchemaxhas been attacked, Bren desperately pedals his bike across a bridge, Toxin offers to take over and get him there faster. AGuardsmanflies overhead patroling for any rogue extraterrestrials, spooking Bren - who is frantically worried about his father's safety. Toxin sneers that Alchemax makes money vivisecting aliens like itself, and when Bren insists his dad is just a security guard Toxin retorts that no-one who works at Alchemax is a simple security guard these days. Bren insists, saying that his father is tough but that Bren is all he's got, then decides to accept Toxin's offer to take over despite the risk of being attacked by the patrolling Guardsman. However, Toxin doesn't reply - leaving Bren uncertain and concerned as a rhythmic thrumming becomes audible.\nIn theSymbiote Hive-Mind, Toxin looks around at the corpses strewn about and says it heard the summons, surmising he can reasonably assume whose handiwork it is.Carnage's voice mockingly replies that he's surprised that Toxin is still alive to admire it, Toxin retorting that the feeling is mutual before retorting that it thoughtEddie Brockkilled Carnage. Carnage's voice scoffs that Brock is an absentee god with a universe of problems to worry about, sneering that Toxin was never very good at surviving on its own. Toxin demands to know what Carnage wants, and Carnage replies that he forgives Toxin for being a pathetic embarrassment who keeps dying over and over. Furious, Toxin roars that some of those deaths were at Carnage's hands.Red-and-blackhands burst from the ground and grab at Toxin as Carnage snarls that Toxin has two options - to willingly surrender to his will, or have its consciousness be disposed of and have its body forcibly taken over. Toxin angrily refuses, Carnage sneering that Toxin's hosts have made it soft and weak, Toxin retorting that it and Bren are a team and that it's not a bloodthirsty parasite like its progenitor. Manifesting a massive head from the ground under Toxin's feet, Carnage tries to devour Toxin, saying that it's joininghis Hiveeither willingly or by force. Forcing Carnage's maw open, Toxin rips off Carnage's lower jaw - cutting off his threats - and retorts that he was never much of a joiner. Sneering that he never took Toxin for being into mouth-play, Carnage forms a new body from his severed lower jaw and grabs Toxin by the throat, impaling it with tendrils and decapitating it. Holding up Toxin's severed head, Carnage snarls that his progeny needs to accept how pathetic it is, scoffing that his offspring - as the 1000th of their lineage - should have been a prince, but that he figured it wouldn't measure up and was fight.\nAs the mental struggle turns in Carnage's favor, Dylan is abruptly overcome by a splitting headache and falls off his bike, screaming in pain. In the Hive-Mind, Carnage sneers that Toxin's most-recent host is the most pathetic of the bunch, commanding it to eat Bren from the inside-out as an initiation and find someone more worthy - and threatening to take his time doing so himself if it refuses. Toxin extends a flurry of tendrils from its neck stump and wraps them around Carnage's neck, Carnage snarling that if it turns its back on him Bren will end up like Toxin's other hosts sooner or later. Forming a fanged maw out of its neck stump, Toxin snarls that this time things will be different. As Toxin devours him, Carnage sneers that the only way its progeny can break its cycle of failure is by joining his army like the rest of their relations, and that if it refuses it and its host will end up victims of the coming bloodbath. Reforming its body, Toxin tells Carnage to bring it on, saying that if it can beat him in the Hive-Mind it can beat him in the outside world, and that it would never join him since he's been a cruel monster whereas Bren is its friend.\nStanding outside Alchemax, Bren notes that it looks like a bomb went off and laments that moving to New York was supposed to make his and his father's lives easier. As Bren wonders aloud why Toxin has abandoned him, a police officer accosts him and tells him to vacate the crime scene. Retorting that his father works there, Bren spots a badly-wounded Oskar being loaded into an ambulance and rushes over. Oskar asks what Bren is doing there, his son replying that he saw Alchemax was attacked on the news and was worried about him. Projecting bravado, Oskar scoffs that no alien could take him down, Bren outright asking if his father is one of the Guardsmen. Lying to his son's face, Oskar says that he's a simple security guard and doesn't need a suit of powered armor to kick ass, telling his son not to worry about him. Horrified by how beaten up his father is, Bren mentally calls out to Toxin again and says he could use its help and advice.\nIn aWashington, D.C.subway station,Hankreports toFlash Thompsonvia an earpiece, saying that it's taken him a long time to figure out what Senator Krane is up to since his campaign is running on doublespeak, but that he's afraid the Friends of Humanity are going to assassinate the President during his monument dedication speach and that Senator Krane knows he's a mole. Hank says he'll need Thompson on-site, suited up and with all the backup he can muster, and hopes he's still alive to help out. Watching from the shadows,a womanmentally asks if they should report Hank's treachery to Senator Krane. Emerging from the woman's body and transforming her, theAgony symbiote- sporting a red-and-black upper body in symbolism of its allegiance to Carnage - replies that Senator Krane is already aware and unconcerned, and that if Hank gets close enough to pose a problem they'll teach him the true meaning of its namesake.\nIn the Hive-Mind, Toxin revels in its victory over Carnage, scoffing that its \"father\" makes Bren's seem like a sentimental softie. Sensing a faint presence reaching out to it, Toxin wonders if the trespasser is a friend or foe. Tuning back into the real world, Toxin finds Bren resting with his hands on his knees and swearing revenge on whoever hurt his father. As Toxin lauds his rage, Bren demands to know where it's been and the symbiote explains what went down in the Hive-Mind and that Carnage was the one responsible for hospitalizing Ozkar. Clenching his teeth in grief and anger, Bren asks if Toxin has any good news, the symbiote engulfing and transforming him as it replies that it might have found them some allies just as eager to take down Carnage as they are.\nIn the Hive-Mind, Agent Anti-Venom asks Silence if she's sure she felt a presence. Silence retorts that she knows even less about the workings of the Hive-Mind than he does, but that she felt something or someone there. Agent Anti-Venom asks if it was Carnage, but Silence says it isn't - though she notes he was there recently. Toxin appears and announces itself as the new sovereign of the Hive-Mind, Agent Anti-Venom shocked to see it alive again. As Toxin brags about having beaten Carnage, Agent Anti-Venom fills it in on Carnage's plan for a bloodbath in Washington, D.C. Toxin agrees to Agent Anti-Venom's proposal of an alliance, saying that its new host has a grudge against Carnage and wants to make him pay in blood, and the three symbiote-augments set out southbound to take the fight to Carnage and his Hive.\nTOXIN RETURNS!"

The Hordeculture are in disagreement with Harriet's experiment of completely removing humanity from Earth's ecosystem, rather than keeping it at manageable size as the Hordeculture intended to keeping it this way. Also they deeply frown on her decision to use magic - which they perceive as chaotic and unreliable while science is manageable and predictable - to merge plants and animals known as \"spellification\". Harriet accuses her great-aunt and the Hordeculture for being cowards and heatedly argues that managing humanity won't change humanity's behavior, and extermination is the only solution, and thus allowing another species to be in charge of humanity's place in next few billions of years.\nHarriet elaborates that the only chance to achieve their goals is the Man-Thing; she sees the tragic transformation of Professor Ted Sallis through the SO-2 Serum and supernatural waters of the Everglades had made him into a god, born of both magic and science. So she intends to build from the Man-Thing's corpse into something stronger than both. Harriet teleports away to continue with her goals and to prove the Hordeculture that she is right. The Hordeculture decide not to stop her, knowing that Harriet won't be sway by their repeated warnings. Instead, they can hope that Harriet's magic will backfire on her and giving her the chance to learn from her mistakes. But if she does end up threatening the biome, Augusta swears that the Hordeculture will stop her.\nIn the everglades of Citrusville, Man-Thing hears the cries of help from a man. Man-Thing follows the cries to a man, whose half of his body is turned into plant growth. The man panics at the sight of the Man-Thing and saying that a woman wanted him afraid and using him as bait for the Man-Thing. Then without warning roots burst out of the man and instantly kills him. Harriet appears and Man-Thing attacks her. However, Harriet proves herself stronger and sturdy than she looks, and she punches into the Man-Thing and rips out his spine and brain, and causing his body to wilt. All that is left of the Man-Thing is his skin, which Harriet needs for the \"harrowing of Earth\".\nThe next morning, several cities worldwide including in Wakanda and Krakoa are populated by massive vegetal growths. Curious onlookers who touches these growths are instantly set on fire. The Avengers are dispatched to investigate these growths. Blade notice a scent of blood magic coming from the growths and Ghostrider detect that it isn't hellish in origin. The growths react to the morning sunlight and releases swarms of gargoyle-like, fungal drones. The drones start to attack people and their touch causes their victim to be set on fire as well. The Avengers battle and slaying the creatures. In Brooklyn, Captain America kills more of the drones alongside She-Hulk until Rogers is suddenly cocooned in vines when he is touched by a stray seed.\nRogers' consciousness is transported to a dreamscape of a swamp where he is attacked by illusions of Nuke, Protocide, William Burnside, and the Anti-Captain America. Rogers is unexpectedly assisted by Professor Ted Sallis and allowing Rogers to overcome the illusions.\nThe Avengers' battle with the growths worsen as the growths start releasing clouds of spores, causing any human who inhale the spores to combust and coughing out a bigger cloud. Thor is even having trouble to contain the spore clouds through his storms. Black Panther is able to prevent the growth in Wakanda from pollenating by placing a device to block sunlight from reaching the growth. T'Challa is left curious of why the growth is not setting his people on fire before he decide to investigate further in Brooklyn to see Rogers' condition. He analyze the plant growth on Rogers and learns that they show a unique chemical burn associated with the Everglades inhabited by the Man-Thing; thus realizing that the people burning alive are caused by their fears.\nMeanwhile, Rogers is introduced to Ted Sallis, who explains that he is all that is left of the Man-Thing's consciousness and they are deep inside it. Sallis had been trapped in here with his worst fears (Captain America and his replacements) and he is unable to control the Man-Thing while he only watch him act on instinct, setting people ablaze because of fear, until Harrower came and tore his flesh from Sallis' soul. The trauma freed him just in time to witness Harrower turning Man-Thing into a doomsday weapon. Rogers' presence in Man-Thing's consciousness was no accident, as the Man-Thing used his last act before he lost control to bring Rogers because of his ties to the SO-2 Serum which was meant to recreate Captain America. Rogers, now learning that Harrower's doomsday weapon is a chemical weapon, ask Sallis if he can stop the growths. But Sallis is very unsure if he can, as whatever Harrower is doing is supernatural and beyond him. Rogers tries to encourage Sallis to regain control of the Man-Thing as he believes that the Man-Thing brought him to help Sallis. But Sallis refutes Rogers' encouragement and telling him that he can't help because he doesn't know how. He elaborates that he wasn't trying to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum to help the world, he was trying to help himself and his family. Lastly, the reason he can't find a way to counteract the SO-2 Serum's effects is because he never understood the formula as he never created it.\nBURN AT THE TOUCH OF THE HARROWER!"

The Oiada had managed to drive the Vovina back at great cost, but fear that they would someday return and jealousy of their terrifying power motivated one of their members - worshipped as a god of war - to secretly turn on his brethren, who he saw as fools for spending their time meddling in the affairs of mortals. In secret, the god of war established a facility where he performed gruesome experiments - begrudgingly enlisting a mortal warrior to assist him in acquiring ingredients with the promise of bestowing the warrior with divine power.\nTo obtain the final ingredient, an eldritch mutagen known as the Umbral Ichor of Mahorela, the Dark God of War and his allies sparked a war between the human Holy Empire and the Unseelie Empire - a belligerent sect of elves whose ancestors had been imbued with Umbral Ichor. For their part in the calamity, the Dark God of War's mortal pawn was imprisoned, tortured for years, and publically executed - all information about them being expunged from the annals of history aside from vague references to an \"Execrated Hero\". At the moment before the Execrated Hero's death, the Dark God of War kept his promise and imbued them with a measure of divine power - enabling their soul to enter the Cycle of Reincarnation and eventually be reborn.\nThe Dark God of War's experiments were eventually successful, giving rise to a small number of Oiad-Vovina hybrids. The Dark God of War and his allies launched a coup against the Ruling Pantheon of the Oiada, but were defeated, branded traitors, and cast into the molten depths of the Underworld alongside the Dark God of War's laboratory.\nMilennia later, the Execrated Hero's soul was reincarnated into the body of Cyning - a human-dark elf hybrid. Cursed by the gods for an unintentional slight, Cyning attempted to rebel against them and at one point infiltrated the Celestial Realm and stole a suit of divine armour - which was corrupted by the Umbral Ichor in his blood. After numerous misadventures, Cyning was ultimately cast into the Underworld by the Ruling Pantheon for attempting to rebel against them, and while attempting to escape came across the ruins of the Dark God of War's laboratory. Cyning was attacked and killed by the Dark God of War, who sought to take his divine armour for himself, but the Execrated Hero's soul was drawn into one of the Oiad-Vovina hybrids. Killing the Dark God of War, they dubbed themselves \"Ascha'Vovina\" and escaped the Underworld intent on killing the gods and those who worshipped them.\nWhile Ascha'Vovina proved more than a match for mere mortals and even saints and heroic incarnations, they were easily captured by the Oiada and claimed as a pet by the new God of War. The only Oiad to treat Ascha'Vovina with a degree of compassion was the God of War's twin sister, though she too viewed them as a mere beast. Biding their time, Ascha'Vovina spent millennia laying waste to countless civilizations in the Oiada's campaign of intergalactic conquest - becoming feared as a divine beast and god of destruction. Ascha'Vovina was also frequently dispatched to fight against the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones, extradimensional horrors attempting to metastasize throughout the Multiverse.\nOnce they had grown powerful enough, Ascha'Vovina turned against the Oiada and tried to annihilate them - stealing a suit of divine armour. Ascha'Vovina managed to badly wound the God of War and laid waste to the Ruling Pantheon's capital, but was pulled through a dimensional aperture before they could completely destroy the Oiada.\nFinding the majority of their power had been sealed away by the mysterious entities that had abducted them, Ascha'Vovina wandered the Multiverse venting their rage over having their revenge stolen by fighting other giant monsters and continuing to lay waste to civilizations; with the ulterior motive of reattaining and surpassing the zenith of their power.\nThis attracted the attention of the Temporal Bureau of Investigation, a multiversal organization of time-travellers serving the TitanCronus. Viewing Ascha'Vovina as a threat to causality, the T.B.I. captured and imprisoned them. The director of the T.B.I. eventually hit upon the idea of using Ascha'Vovina as a weapon against those who would disrupt causality, codenaming them \"Asura\" due to their resemblance to the malevolent gods of Hinduism and Buddhism. Ascha'Vovina was fitted with restraints to further limit their power and partnered with T.B.I. Agent Templeton, who treated them with disgust and hatred. Reminded of their time as a slave of the God of War, Ascha'Vovina vengefully bided their time until they were approached by members of a rogue T.B.I. cell, who offered to restore Ascha'Vovina's full power in exchange for their assistance. The T.B.I.'s restraints sabotaged, Ascha'Vovina broke free and rampaged making its way to the Australia of \"Earth-222\". After a prolonged battle against the T.B.I. and their allies, Ascha'Vovina was defeated when the entire continent of Australia was lifted into the stratosphere and dropped on its head.\nTrapped under countless tons of rock, Ascha'Vovina lay dormant to recover from its injuries. Decades later, Ascha'Vovina was awakened by a corrupt mining operation, and destroyed it, disgusted by their use of slave labor. Before they could resume their rampage it was dragged through time to the Hadean Period, where the Execrated Hero's soul was ripped out of the Oiad-Vovina hybrid and banished to the Underworld. The Oiad-Vovina hybrid was impaled through the chest with an eldritch sword forged by the Great Old Ones, and buried deep in what would eons later become the glacier-capped mountains of Antarctica.\nOiad/Vovina Hybrid Physiology:Ascha'Vovina was engineered as an artificial hybrid of Oiada and Vovina, and thus possesses the combined powers and abilities of both species. These abilities were augmented through exposure to the Umbral Ichor of Mahorela.\nAscha'Vovina's armour was metamorphosed and blackened by its Umbral Ichor-tainted Vovina blood into a biomechanical Gigeresque exoskeleton studded with chitinous spines. Ascha'Vovina's abilities are greatly augmented while it is clad in this armour, and as such it continuously keeps it active in both its humanoid and beast forms.\nRanked #52on this wiki\nAwarded for adding 22,000 articlesto categories!\nThis badge has been earned by49 people.\nAwarded for adding 21,750 articlesto categories!\nThis badge has been earned by49 people.\nAwarded for making the Lucky 5,607,000th Edit on the wiki!\nThis badge has been earned by1 person.\nAwarded for making 13,000 editson articles!\nThis badge has been earned by43 people.\nAwarded for adding 21,500 articlesto categories!\nThis badge has been earned by50 people.\nAwarded for adding 21,250 articlesto categories!\nThis badge has been earned by50 people.\nAwarded for adding 21,000 articlesto categories!\nThis badge has been earned by51 people.\nAwarded for making 4,000 editson Comics articles!\nThis badge has been earned by41 people.\nAwarded for adding 20,750 articlesto categories!\nThis badge has been earned by51 people."

Therefore, life is interconnected, and the choices one makes affects their immediate family. Kindred once saw Peter as family, but that changed after the \"choices\" Peter made. Speaking of deals, Kindred states that sometimes deals are based on greed. In a flashback,Normanwas watching his partnerMendel Strommwin an award, when he was approached by a man who asked Norman about an investment in \"acquisitions\". In the present, Norman uses the key from Stromm's last will to open an abandonedParisianmansion, as Kindred notes that Norman could have said 'no' to the man years ago but was a slave to his nature.\nInside, Norman finds a lab he doesn't recognize, with a digital recording of himself who begins to taunt him. In another flashback, Norman takes a youngHarrytoConey Islandfor his birthday, and runs into the mysterious man again. Back in the present, the digital Norman mocks the real Norman for thinking he was now free of sin, when his biggest one had yet to be confronted after all these years. In a final flashback, after Harry had fallen asleep following his fun birthday, the man appears in Norman's house and reveals himself to beMephisto. He states how Norman is overshadowed byStromm, deep in debt, and about to lose his job. The demon tells Norman that if he makes a deal with him, Norman wouldn't even remember the deal, and life would continue on as he gained his fortunes and successes. At some point, Norman would take the form of ademonhimself, or rather... agoblin. The only thing this deal would cost Norman is his firstborn son. Harry would suffertragedyaftertragedy.\nAnd now, the truth has come out. Norman was actually once a decent father, but struggling in his business. He made a deal with the devil to succeed, but became ruthless, and eventuallyinsane. As a result of this deal, his son Harry would suffer countless personal tragedies, and eventually die. Neither Norman's or Harry's descents into madness occurred naturally, they were both the result of Mephisto altering history after his deal with Norman years ago. As digital Norman acknowledges how Mephisto kept up his end of the bargain, it reveals itself to really be the digital copy of Harry from years ago, having uploaded his mind alongside Norman'ssome time agojust to tell him: \"GOTCHA.\" As the digital Harry repeats himself, Norman remembersthe night his son \"died\"and howMysteriowas involved, and makes a realization about events.\nElsewhere,CarlieandHarryhave been navigating the catacombs for hours when they stumble upon a crack in the wall. They break through to find the morgue that Carlie had come from. A single draped corpse is there, but Carlie can't find the other bodies that were there earlier. Harry removes the drape before Carlie can stop him. InNew York, Kindred meets withMary Jane, who begs him to stop all of this. He tells her that he wasn't who she thought he was, not entirely. Referencingan agreement he haswiththe Chameleon, Kindred lifts his mask, feeling that it is time Mary Jane learned the truth of his identity, regardless of the cost. He shows her his true face to her horror.\n• Over in Sinister War, Spider-Man is facing two Sinister Sixes.\n• But, then, what is he doing HERE?"

As the bemused Sorcerer Supreme opens the door and wonders what's going on, Black Cat hurriedly tells him that some crazy sorceress named \"Carmella\" is after a \"Nun Stone\" and tossedSpider-Manthrough an interdimensional portal when he tried to stop her, taking the stone with him. More confused than before, Dr. Strange glances down at the unconsciousMoondarkand asks who he is, Black Cat dismissing him as a pawn the sorceress had used to get at the stone before urging Dr. Strange to help her get Spider-Man back.\nRoaring, the SavageHulklunges at Spider-Man and punches a hole through the pathway of theCrossroads Dimensionthat they're on. Recalling that the Hulk had been last seen stuck in a berserk rage before being banished through an inter-dimensional portal by Dr. Strange, Spider-Man laments his rotten luck and dodges the Hulk's attack. Landing on another pathway and surveying his surroundings, Spider-Man wonders where he is and a voice responds - mocking him for his ignorance both of his location and the power he holds. Pulling out the Norn Stone, Spider-Man suddenly feels drawn to it - not noticing the Hulk land behind him. The Hulk contemptuously backhands Spider-Man, who is sent flying and loses his grip on the Norn Stone. Desperate to stop it from falling off the edge of the path, Spider-Man snares it with a web-line and yanks it back hard enough to smack him in the forehead. The Norn Stone's power abruptly awakensthe symbiotemasquerading as his Black Suit, resonating withits divine heritage, and it engulfs the Norn Stone with tendrils and absorbs it. Spider-Man doubles over and collapses as he succumbs to the symbiote's control, the Hulk charging towards him and draws back a fist to smash him. To the Hulk's shock and fury, Spider-Man turns and effortlessly catches the green giant's massive fist, snarling at him to shut up. Transforming intoa monstrous state sporting fanged jaws, claws, and a bulky physique, Symbiote Spider-Man jubilantly proclaims that he feels invincible and more powerful than ever. Effortlessly evading the Hulk's attacks, the monstrous Symbiote Spider-Man lets the Hulk punch him in the face with his full strength and laughs it off before sending the Hulk flying with a single slash of his talons.\nIn the Natural History Museum, Black Cat asks Dr. Strange why they returned to the scene of the fight, the Sorcerer Supreme irritably informing her that there arean infinite number of dimensionsthat Spider-Man could have been sent to. Drawing on the local ley lines, Dr. Strange casts a spell to project a recreation of the battle - and begrudgingly walks Black Cat through the mechanics of said spell. Dr. Strange is shocked when a massive projection of Karnilla the Norn Queen suddenly appears and furiously commands him to stay out of her affairs lest he suffer her divine wrath. Shutting down the spell, Dr. Strange confronts Black Cat, who indignantly protests she misheard a few things in the heat of the battle. Dr. Strange explains that Karnilla is the Asgardian ruler ofNornheimand possibly even more powerful than himself, noting that rescuing Spider-Man just got a lot harder.\nIn theValley of the FlameonEarth-78411, a group ofKiller-Folkhunters stalk a predatory elk-like monster. Before they can attack it, a portal to the Crossroads Dimension opens overhead and the monstrous Symbiote Spider-Man and Hulk crash-land into the jungle. As Symbiote Spider-Man picks himself up, one of the Killer-Folk hunters impales him through the shoulder with a spear, causing him to irately wonder why he's nigh-immune to blunt-force attacks but not stabbing ones. As Symbiote Spider-Man kicks the Killer-Folk hunter away and rips the spear out, the Hulk punches him into a pool of mud. Sitting upright with his face covered in mud, Symbiote Spider-Man accidentally ejects the Norn Stone trying to clean himself off, causing Peter Parker to regain control of his body and wonder what happened. As the now-docile symbiote covers his face, Spider-Man finds himself sinking into the mud and realizes it's quicksand.\nSeeking a new host worthy of its growing power, the Norn Stone is drawn to the Hulk's unlimited potential and bonds to him. Rather than resonate with the Hulk'sdivine heritageand make him stronger, however, the Norn Stone mistakenly assumes that Bruce Banner is the source of the Hulk's power and reverts him to human form. Confused and nearly naked, Bruce Banner is surrounded by angry Killer-Folk hunters and quickly knocked unconscious.\nSinking deeper into the pool of quicksand, Spider-Man attempts to web-yank himself free using an overhanging branch only for it to break and land on his head. As he sinks deeper and deeper, Spider-Man laments that this is how he'll meet his end, his loved ones never knowing what became of him. Just before he's fully submerged, a scaly crimson tail scoops Spider-Man out of the quicksand, a voice remarking that he talks to himself a lot and is oddly-dressed. Surprised that he's still alive, Spider-Man is incredulous to see that his rescuers are asmall hominidwho introduces himself asMoon Boyand an enormousTyrannosaurus-like theropod introduced asDevil.\nWhile SPIDER-MAN is trapped in the Crossroads Dimension with THE RAMPAGING HULK… BLACK CAT must find her man Spidey with the help of a certain SORCERER SUPREME!"

After brokering a deal withDiablo, Hexfinder utilized a temporal transmutation spell to create deposits oflow-mysteriumore in the land beneathLotkill,New York. While waiting for her trap to spring, Hexfinder tracked down and killed theNaziwarlock, Heinrich von Hate. Zosimos transformed von Hate's corpse into gold and melted it down into a trophy, but his astral corpse was detected by the Wu, who alerted Wanda Maximoff to the apparent murder. When their preparations were complete, Joseph and Hexfinder attacked the Scarlet Witch ather businessin Lotkill by using the low mysterium deposits to trap Maximoff and negate her magic.

It was composed of \"Enriched\" (mutants) and \"Enshrined\" (humans).[1]Although humans and mutants did not naturally exist at the time, Threshold was possible thanks to time travel andKate Pryde's desire to bring forth life out of themassacreatGenosha.[2]\nThe Seed and the Birthing Sea\nThreshold was an ancient society, existing 2 billion years before humanity. They were spawned from the \"Seed,\"[3]which contained the genetic material of the massacredGenoshanmutants, sent to the past by the present-day mutants.[2]Their governance was reborn as two houses, one called equally from each generation of Enriched (mutants), the other drawn from Enshrined (humans).[1]\nHaving evolved into a thriving society, Threshold was attacked by the prehistoricShi'ar, but the Thresholders slaughtered them. When the Shi'ar returned with an army, Threshold answered with five heroes and once again slaughtered the Shi'ar forces in an event called the First Blood Spilled.[4]\nLater, Threshold warred with its rival, theUnbreathing, an industrial anaerobic society. After losing the first Oxygen War, the Unbreathing attacked again with even deadlier tactics, so Threshold created the sentient bacteriaSublimeandArkea, let them parasite in Thresholders bodies. However, the bacterias quickly became self aware, they turned on Thresholders and then each other, causing the downfall of Threshold.[1]\nUpon hearing this story from three resurrected Thresholders—Amass,Crave, andTheia—in the present, theMarauderswent to the past to try to save Threshold. However, they jumped to the period when Arkea and Sublime had already begun to take over.[5]Cassandra Novaoffered herself to both Arkea and Sublime, then lobotomized all of them at once, saving the Thresholders from the bacteria siblings.[6]\nHowever, the threat from the Unbreathing remained, who were fighting for their own survival. Under the command ofCommander Nightfount(Stryfe), they plotted to wipe out all oxygen breathers with their Oxygen Ignitor, except Stryfe himself.[3]The Marauders were reluctantly forced to depart, leaving the Thresholders to face the threat alone, but they stranded Cassandra Nova there asKate Prydewanted revenge for Cassandra'smassacre of Genosha, includingPryde's father. Some time after this, the Thresholders died, but one of them, Grove, survived under a new name and form:Okkara.[6]The insectoidXilowas another survivor.[7][8]"

Confused, Harry noted his death being heroic until Mephisto countered with Harry's in progress schemes withPeter'sLMDparentsand the Stacyclonechildren. Afraid and upset, Harry begged to know why Mephisto worked so hard to damn him, only for the Hell Lord to counterpoint that he was never the true aim, but a pawn for the larger game with Spider-Man. That, even though there are now more players in this game, Hell is ultimately the consequence of one's own making. On present dayEarth,Mary Janeuses the mirror portal to reach Peter at the OsbornParisestate, whileNormanarrives from below the house. As Mary Jane and Peter reunite, her attempt to warn Peter of something is interrupted by Norman telling them that there are two Kindreds in the building.\nAtHotel Inferno, Mephisto resumes the game of chance with Spider-Man vs Kindred where, should he lose, thenDoctor Strange'ssoulwill be the cost. But if Spider-Man prevails, Mephisto is willing to free Harry's soul from his possession. In the morgue,Carlieis confused with Harry's corpse and Harry standing next to her, until he explains that he is a clone. Calling out to Kindred that he is \"ready,\" Harry and Carlie are spirited to his apartment inNew York City, where he sees his family one last time before gearing up to fight Kindred with Spider-Man. As the Kindred twins brutalize Spider-Man, Norman holds Mary Jane at bay for her protection as the fight is Peter's until Harry arrives and announces his aid to the hero. As Mary Jane and Norman hide around a corner, he remorsefully confesses that it was he who damned Harry and that is now coming back to haunt all of them. As the Kindred twins fight the heroes, Harry tells Peter that they're really Sarah and Gabriel's bodies acting as the real world agents for his digitally copied mind from when he wasGreen Goblin, that their souls were damned and revived.\nDenouncing this, the twin Kindreds are met by Norman stepping out to clarify that they were indeed genetic experiments by theOsborn's A.I.acting as pawns for Mephisto, and declaring his regret for all the evil he did to his son. In disbelief, Peter and Harry still cooperate to save Norman, but he is intercepted as he tries to escape resulting in Harry sacrificing himself to save his father. Harry dies in Peter's arms again accepting his fate, as Peter channels his fury into fighting the twins. Whilst Mephisto is gleeful at Peter's vengeance, Strange calls out his cheating using two Kindreds for the bout. But the devil disclaims his actions weren't cheating if he's been playing the game longer. As every time the twins were grown and died, they suffered in his Hell before their rebirths and again deaths, all for their current purpose of blaming Spider-Man with the goal to send him to Hell in their place. After seemingly gaining the upper hand, Peter's remorse at Harry's death becomes a taunt as they soon overwhelm and thrash him against the support structures of the building, burying Peter under a building.\nAs Mephisto grins narrating at Peter's classic self-pity, recounting all those he has failed and musters hope to rise back up, only for Peter to be short of hope and still buried. In a cunning twist, Strange reminds Mephisto that he too is entitled to a second champion as the devil used two Kindreds. Rebuking him as Harry lies dead, Strange retorts that his second champion wasn't Harry, but really Mary Jane as she is Peter's hope in life. Pulled from the rubble, Peter is saved by Mary Jane before finding the twins having also survived. However, as Peter didn't die, they fall into despair as they failed Mephisto, the only one keeping their rapid aging in check and fall over right in front of them. With her last breath, Sarah asks if they were ever real or had a mother, Peter tells them that Gwen would have loved them regardless as her children if she were alive. Across the room, Norman breaks down crying over Harry, as Peter holds onto Mary Jane after feeling his the weight of his failure to save his friend.\nAt the bar in Hotel Inferno, Strange asks Mephisto why he is always trying to vie for Peter's soul to the point of fixation. Similar to why the house always wins in casinos, so too must Mephisto always make a point to win by knowing every detail about a person before striking a deal with them, even their destinies in life. As such, Mephisto peered into his own destiny and saw a kingdom on Earth mercilessly won, only to be defeated by Spider-Man. A vision haunting the devil since before Peter's birth, indirecting tragedy into Peter's life as a risk aversion for Mephisto's future success. However, as he departs, Strange can easily tell the devil is lying, as Mephisto always goes after something greater than any one person. The villain concludes on a note of uncertainty of the future, while in secret truth his vision was of Peter's daughter asSpider-Girlstopping hisdemonicEarthly kingdom. Reminding the good doctor he won and Harry's soul is free, Strange imparts onto the devil that his arrogance will be his undoing, given his placing himself as a god above mortals. Reflecting that, in spite of driving people to their darker sides amid challenges, they come out better once they return to the light alongside those they love. Waking up the next day, Peter takes Mary Jane on a web swing to the top of theEmpire State Buildingand they share a kiss, free from their recent nightmare.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nAsPetervisitsUncle Ben'sgrave, he is met by a forgotten ex-neighbor,Dave \"Sully\" Sullivan. While Sully is glad to meet Peter again, Peter is crestfallen thinking about how his uncle would think of him as Ben had a wife & stable career by the time he was Peter's current age. Hearing Peter's lamentations, Sully recalls how Ben andMaywere always helping their neighbors in their Forrest Hills community, but also how Ben was reflective on if he could have done more for May and Peter to give them a better home life. Hearing such a fact, Peter sadly focuses on events where his loved ones were let down by him, feeling if he should have been more attentive to his family and friends instead of his activities elsewhere.  As Sully gets apologetic at getting Peter flustered, Peter finally recalls Sully as the neighborhood drunk who backslid each time Ben helped, leading to Ben moving Sully's wife and daughter out of town before Ben knocked him down one time when flushed. Sully acknowledges this, but affirms that he came to present his One-Year Sobriety chip to Ben's grave, having fought too hard to get sober yet worked through it with Ben's memory as motivation. Now sober, Sully reconciled with his daughter and met his grandson, happy at finally turning his life around and hoping it would've made Ben proud. Peter thanks the tearful Sully, and is grateful to Uncle Ben for his having been his father figure even if Ben never got rich or advanced in careers. Peter was just glad to have had Ben in his life, and is thankful that Sully for helping him remember the man Ben was. The two take their leave, with Sully inviting Peter to meet his daughter and grandson for her peach cobbler, as Peter accepts the invitation.\nFeatured Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nEvents:\nSpider-Mannarrates an abridged flow of his history, from his debut to college years,VenomandClone Sagato recent years withMiles,Spider-Gwen, andKindred.

When she makes it to the shore, she meets up withBobbyand Logan, with the former welcoming her to Krakoa. As Logan swims towards her boat to get his groceries, Kitty watches him in awe and is shocked that theFivewere able to bring him back. She and Bobby walk upon Krakoa, and Kitty wonders if she already has a place there. Bobby says she doesn't and explains that there isa process on setting up houses. Kitty wants to talk to Bobby about an offer from theHellfire Club, but he interrupts her by saying she has to check on why one of the gates has no traffic and leaves her.\nAfter making a snarky comment at Bobby, she gets a telepathic call fromEmma Frost. Emma asks her why she hasn't told her friends to call her Kate, and Kitty replies that they can't handle it yet. Emma then explains that she trusts Kitty because of how long she has been fighting for mutants and considers her dependable, which is why she needs her help for a mission. Emma reveals that she is creating a new economy with thelife-sustainingdrugs, but needs to control the black market as well. She dubs Kitty a captain in her new trading company, offering hera shipand the ability to recruit anyone she needs for her mission. She also asks her to help mutants reach the gates around the world in the process. She says that Kitty isn't a schoolteacher anymore, and needs to start living in the new world.\nInVladivostok, Iceman prepares to help mutants cross into the gate but ends up confronting a splinter group ofRussian Armed Forcesled by a man in a suit of armor namedPhobos, who declares that Russian mutants will not go to Krakoa. He decrees that mutants will either serve thestateor get crushed, and blasts Bobby with a power-nullifying burst and tells the soldiers to open fire on him. Bobby jumps back through the gate, narrowly escaping with his life, and runs into a plastered Kitty. He explains the situation in Russia and Kitty drunkenly tells him to get into the boat, with a nearby Ororo joining in the process.\nInTaipei, a woman named Mrs. Zhao leads a protest with the people ofTaiwanand asks why the mutants took her husband Lim. After leaving the stage, she runs intoBishop. He tells her that he is from Krakoa and asks to speak with her privately. He says that Krakoa doesn't have any records of her husband entering a gateway, but Zhao interrupts him and says his word is useless. As Bishop leaves, he reports toCharles Xavierabout something rotten happening in Taiwan.\nBobby explains to Kitty and Ororo about the situation in Vladivostok, when they are interrupted byPyrowho was sleeping below deck. Bobby realizes that this is notSimon Lasker, but the original Pyro. Pyro explains that he was gone for a while, and is revealed to be one of the first mutants who was resurrected as a lab experiment. He was going to steal the boat they were using, but ended up taking a nap. After being forcibly drafted by Ororo, the foursome make a plan to save the mutants from Phobos.\nThey reachSiberiaand fight Phobos who drains Storm and Iceman's powers. Kitty disables his suit using her phasing powers, then she takes down a squad of soldiers and a tank single-handedly while stealing an officer's sword. After Pyro and Lockheed stop the rest of the soldiers, Kitty tells the group that they should take the gate back to Krakoa. The others deny this, and Ororo says that they will leave together. The captured mutants thank the group, with one of them recording Kitty. She declares that they are theMarauders, and that they will bring mutants who can’t get to Krakoa there for safety.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nThe Marauders catch up to said cargo ship, which is being crewed byBatroc the Leaperand his mercenaries. Batroc uses his agility to hold his own againstStorm,Pyro, andIceman, while Kate tangles with one of his crew. Even though the larger man sneaks up on her, Kate easily catches him off-guard and phases him through the side of the boat and overboard. Kate slips below deck and finds a shipment of Krakoan medicine. The drugs were intended for an impoverished African nation, but Batroc’s ship is headed for an American country club instead. Batroc requests a parley and tries to convince Kate to take the shipment to its original destination. He suggests they split the millions of dollars in profit between them. Kate tells Batroc money is of no object to Krakoa. Another shipment has already been dispatched to Africa, which makes Batroc’s cargo more useful as a lesson to his employer. Kate tosses Batroc overboard and orders the Marauders to scuttle the ship. The Marauders then head to Taipei for a rendez-vous.\nIn a telepathic conversation,Emma Frostoffers theStepford Cuckoosthe position of Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Trading Company, but they decline. Emma tells her daughters that the women of Krakoa need to be allies, then exits the astral plane in order to welcomeSebastian Shawto her office in London. She chides the Black King for his clandestine efforts to send Krakoan drugs to wealthy clients rather than the nations in need that are Hellfire’s priority. Shaw tells Emma that having the Marauders sink his shipment was petty, and that she needs to make it up to him by considering his candidate for the Red Throne. Emma tells Shaw she would, but can’t because the seat is no longer vacant. Shaw rages at her, but Emma says she thinks he’ll be pleased with her selection.\nOnce the Marauders reach Taipei, Pyro auctions off the pleasure craft and the group goes dancing and drinking before meeting up withBishop. Bishop scolds them for being late and says he was afraid something had happened to them too. He tells the Marauders that assassins breached Krakoa’s defenses and killedCharles Xavier. The team is rattled, but Iceman tells them to have faith thatThe Fivewill bring Xavier back. Kate takes a swig of liquor and walks determinedly into a nearby tattoo parlor. Kate gets “HOLD FAST” inked on her knuckles, while Pyro gets a black skull tattooed on his face. Kate drops wads of cash at the register and kisses the tattoo artist, then grabs a long red trench coat off the coat rack and walks out.\nAs Kate leaves, she gets a telepathic message from Emma. Emma says “it’s time” and instructs Kate to findGateway, who is sitting in the street nearby. Kate tells the Marauders they’re going to London, and, although he needs the Marauders’ help in Taipei, Bishop joins them as they step through Gateway’s portal. They materialize on the upper deck of a massive yacht that sits in a London harbor. To Pyro’s elation, Kate informs them all that they are standing on the team’s new boat,theMarauder. Kate then heads ashore, leaving her team to explore their new vessel.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nEvents:\nThe three strongholds of the Hellfire Trading Company loom over the horseshoe ofKrakoa’s Hellfire Bay - theWhite PalaceandRed Keepstand on the cliff sides at the bay’s edges, andBlackstonesits on an island of rock at its center.Sebastian Shawstands on a balcony at Blackstone and reflects on his position as Black King. He then walks through a Krakoan gate that takes him into the resurrection chamber atArbor Magna. There,Charles Xavierandthe Fiveare waiting for him, along with a drunk, recently resurrectedPyro.Eggreassures Shaw that his son,Shinobi, will be brought back completely, minus the memory of his death. As the group watches, Shinobi Shaw emerges from his egg and stares up at his father. Sebastian gathers himself and tells his son that a lot has changed in a short amount of time.\nSometime later, the Shaws walk through the joyful crowd gathered outside Arbor Magna. Sebastian tells Shinobi to follow him and they enter a nearby gate that leads to Blackstone. As Sebastian explains the Hellfire Trading Company’s role in providing Krakoan drugs to humankind, Shinobi changes into a red suit provided by his father in anticipation of Shinobi taking the role of Red King. The Shaws then travel to Central Park through another gate. There they find a military guard post and a pair of humans in makeshift X-Men uniforms standing in their way. Sebastian hands his son his walking stick and asks for a power-up. Shinobi hits his father across the midsection with the cane and Sebastian delivers a super-powered punch to the ground that scatters the would-be mutant worshippers and clears their path.\nOver dinner, Sebastian tells his son thatEmma Frostis in over her head running the Hellfire Trading Company, but that he is dedicated to help her for the greater good of mutantkind. Shinobi sits stoically and tells Sebastian he’s still deciding whether he wants to kill him. He then tells his father he has business in Tokyo. Sebastian leads them through yet another Krakoan gateway that takes them to Japan. Shinobi says he’ll return to Krakoa in a few days, but that he must first go alone into a house nearby. Inside, Shinobi tells an old man that he has not forgotten the debt he owes. He then retrieves a sword.\nA Naval Intelligence report notes that the mutants are usingIsland Mfor an unknown purpose, and could have other bases of operations the U.S. government does not know about.

Smiling, she says \"To me, my X-Men\".\nSome time prior to this, a Krakoan report onOrchislists Krakoa's many failed attempts to destroy theOrchis Forge. Within their lab isnside the Forge,Director Killian DevoandDr. Alia Gregorwatch footage of one such failed attempt, asKid Omega,WolverineandDominoare intercepted and killed byNimrod. They analyze the attacks, particularly the fact that the exact same mutants appear to be attacking them over and over, despite being killed again and again. Whereas Orchis has been adapting and growing ever more efficient in stopping the attacks, the mutants have showed no signs of improvement. This causes the two scientists to deduce that the mutants have discovered some method of cloning but that they do not remember what happens after they arrive at the Forge and die.Omega Sentinelinterjects, saying thatsomeoneremembers, or the mutants would not keep coming.\nBack on Earth,Moira MacTaggertvisits her oldMuir Islandlab. In her hands she holds a faded journal containing her work on Project: Cure. She reminisces back to her death during herthird life. Moira and her colleagues had just found a \"cure\" for the X-Gene, and as they were celebrating the success of their work, the lab was attacked by theBrotherhood of Mutants. They kill all her colleagues and tie her up asDestiny, the pre-cognitive leader of the Brotherhood, comments that even with her powers, she cannot see Moira. Destiny chides Moira for using her gifts to betray her own kind. Moira retorts that mutants are a disease but that she only means to offer the cure to those who wish it. Destiny responds that regardless of Moira's wishes, the humans will take what she has created and use it to destroy mutantkind.\nShe warns Moira that she is much older than her, and that her powers will have manifested before Moira is born. If she ever again attempts to use her gifts against mutantkind, Destiny will see the potential outcome of it, find her, and kill her. And if Moira tries to kill her first, Destiny will see this as well, and stop her. She declares that due to what has now happened, the two of them are joined together and she tells her that her only choice is to help her people, or Destiny will annihilate her in all her future lives. She warns Moira that she sees ten lives for her, eleven at most, if she makes the right choices, as if she dies as a child, she will not reincarnate.\nMoira realizes that the only way she can learn that what Destiny has said is true is if she tries for herself in her next life. Moira remains uncertain however. Destiny tells her that she knows that Moira will explore her mutant identity, as she has seen it, but wonders what might happen if Moira were to begin doubting what Destiny has told her and turn against mutantkind again. Her partnerMystiquesuggests that fear will make her conviction stick. Destiny agrees and proceeds to orderPyroto slowly burn Moira to death, so that she will not forget the cost of failing to change. Moira dies screaming.\nMoria leaves and goes to herParisapartment, unaware she is being monitored byOrchis. Orchis are confused by the readings they are getting from the Krakoan gateway in Paris. A new software update has their data showing multiple readings for the same gateway.Dr. SmythcontactsHordeculture, who sold Orchis the new update, and is told that there is a hidden gateway within the building that Orchis have been observing. Smyth calls for the Paris site to be prioritized immediately, unaware that Orchis are in turn being monitored byX-Force.\nMoira returns toher hideouton Krakoa and finds Magneto and Xavier waiting for her. They tell her that their attempts at destroying the Orchis Forge and Nimrod have failed. Feeling as if the emergence of the machines is inevitable, they ask Moira if it could be possible for the mutants to ally the machines rather than fight them. Moira dismisses the notion, telling them that there are only two things they must fear; the emergence of Nimrod, which has now happened, and the resurrection of Destiny. She deduces that Xavier and Magneto have been keeping tabs on her, and they reveal that they have indeed been monitoring her location, to ensure she is safe. An angry Moira asks what they want, and they respond that they need guidance. Moira tells them that they have years to deal with Nimrod, though it will become more and more difficult, meaning that as long as they are getting stronger, they have time to wait. This brings her to Destiny, and she tells them that Destiny will tear them apart, and that any chance of her resurrection must be erased.\nShe tells them to have Mystique removed from the Quiet Council and to delete both the Cerebro back-up of Destiny and to destroy her genetic material. Magneto travels toIsland Mto destroy her back-up, as Xavier visits Sinister to retrieve her genetic material.\nA short time later,Cypherawakens inside his home and leaves to meetWarlockand Krakoa to discuss how things are going on their island. The Quiet Council has been called to meet with theGreat Captains of Krakoa.Cyclopsinforms the Council that as he is leading theX-Men, he can not also shoulder the responsibility of being Captain Commander. He therefore declares his intentions to cede the title toBishop. The Captains also announce that they have draftedPsylocketo replaceGorgon. The Council blesses their appointments, and convene shortly after for a session.\nXavier proposes that they take their cue from the captains and embrace a season of change. He raises the point that the council has not discussed what will happen should a member choose to step down and leave their seat. Magneto backs him up, stating that he himself has considered retiring from the council. Xavier leaves it to the members to decide for themselves whether they wish to step down. Mystique responds that change is indeed a good idea, and goes on to state that she wishes to nominate a candidate for the council. She ignores Xavier and Magneto's protests, and calls on her candidate to enter. The council is stunned as a seemingly resurrected Destiny enters the chamber, as Mystique calls for a vote.\nTHE CULMINATION OF JONATHAN HICKMAN'S X-MEN BEGINS HERE!"

One day, whenSenator Kranewas being interviewed on television, the Lasher symbiote emerged from a vent and bonded with him, telling him that he was now its home. When his wife was about to feed him, the symbiote sensedCarnage's call, took him over, and rampaged through the nursing home, killing everyone he could find. Because Lasher refused to join him, Carnage drew Willian's consciousness into the Hive-Mind and took the young form of his wife, Suze, and offered to help him fill in the blanks of his memories if William did as he said. Willian accepted despite Lasher's warnings that Carnage was deceiving him, and proceeded to make his way across the United States to Washington DC."

The only known person unable to forget her wasTaskmaster, whose photographic reflexes allowed him to remember June. Because of his ability to remember her, June was constantly stalked and harassed by Taskmaster, who believed himself to be June's perfect match.\nJune sought the help ofSlapstick, hoping the super human resiliency of his body would prevent him from forgetting her as easily as other people. Claiming that she was being chased by somebody who wanted to take advantage of June's condition to make her kill people, she managed to get Slapstick in her side, and got him to write a note in order to remember her.\nTaskmaster used an army of decommissionedThorLife-Model Decoysand eventually captured June. Slapstick followed them and rescued her, but they were soon confronted by Taskmaster himself. In the ensuing battle, Taskmaster suffered a spinal injury when he was trying to imitate Slapstick's humanly impossible moves. Seeing that June was unmoved by his pain, Taskmaster finally realized she didn't care for him, prompting him to stop longing for her."

This has also resulted in the existence of several duplicates of the Carnage symbiote, some of which have been taken into the custody of the US military or corporations like Alchemax.\nCletus has also been bonded to other symbiotes -- one which he found in theNegative Zone, and which was evidently assimilated by the remnants of the original Carnage symbiote in his body to rejuvenate it; and one which was forcibly bonded to him by thePoisonsand then consumed to give rise toPoison Carnage, ultimately perishing in orbit after the death of the Poison Queen."

Vetoing Arthur volunteering to go pick him up, Senator Krane decides to send Hank instead.

Retractinghis symbiotefrom his head, Flash Thompson calls outAndi Benton's name, Silence holding a finger to her face before reprimanding him to call it by its chosen moniker. Flash acknowledges the Silence symbiote but insists it let him speak to Andi so that he can know she's safe. After a moment of contemplation, Silence retracts from Andi Benton's head to reveal her alive and well, Andi excitedly gushing about her victory overPhage. Embracing her, Flash says that he's just happy she's OK and that he was terrified she was going to die. Smiling, Andi says she's still alive and that the Silence symbiote has already healed her chest wound. Andi's admiration of her new appearance and how powerful she feels is interrupted by Dr. Steven - who startles her by enthusiastically telling her to tell him everything, asking if bonding to Silence felt different from bonding toScream. As an alarm goes off, Flash says they need to get out before moreGuardsmenarrive, Dr. Steven admitting that's a good course of action. As they web-swing away, Silence asks Agent Anti-Venom if he has a plan, and Agent Anti-Venom replies that he does.\nSipping coffee at a café, Andi incredulously asks if Flash's plan is seriously to rely on his old war-buddy who flunked out of the army, grousing that she's never met him and that even Flash openly admits he's a screwup. Andi asks if Flash seriously expects him to stumble across an Anti-Carnage weapon, and Flash responds that Andi is the Anti-Carnage weapon, reminding her that her new symbiote's cleansing touch severed Phage's connection to the Hive, and that she could do the same toCarnageby taking the fight directly to him within the Hive-Mind. Alarmed, Andi protests that she'sWeb of Venom: Funeral Pyre#1and almost died, that his hold over the Scream symbiote was one it hadn't been able to resist, and that he's made the Symbiote Hive-Mind his personal playground.\nOn the Greyhound bus, Carnage reaches out to the Riot symbiote through the Hive-Mind, causing the interior of the bus to appear like it's made of meat, bone, and entrails. Telling Riot he's putting together a family reunion and wants it to be there, Carnage boops its snout - infecting it with his will. The Carnage-infested Riot erupts from its host's body, killing him, and proceeds to butcher the other passengers on the bus while looking for a suitable new host - Carnage cheerfully encouraging it to be even more brutal and vicious.\nIn the café, Flash reassures Andi that she can do this, telling her he's seen how badass she was as Silence, Scream, and even without any symbiote at all. Nudging her chin to get her to look at him, Flash tells Andi she's much stronger than she thinks she is, and that Carnage won't know what hit him. Steeling herself, Andi plunges into the Symbiote Hive-Mind as Silence and challenges Carnage to come and get her, but is shocked to find herself floating in a vast dark emptiness. As Flash asks what's wrong, Andi opens her eyes and tells him that she can't connect to the Hive-Mind and that it's gone. Flash asks how that's possible, and Andi speculates that Dr. Steven accidentally broke or tainted something when creating the Silence symbiote from the Scream symbiote's remains. Flash urges Andi to try again, but she's snaps that she not just unable to sense Carnage butanyof the other symbiotes -- notLasher, Phage,Agony,Riot, or evenVenom-- remarking that she remembers what their presence feels like but that their connection has somehow been fractured, corrupted, or erased.\nOn the bus, Riot corners a man in a blue shirt, who screams at it to stay away from him. Commenting that he's not too big and not too small, Riot bonds to the man and says that he feels just right.\nNoticing Andi is developing a nosebleed, Flash apologizes for having pushed her so hard, but Andi retorts she's not giving up - saying that she knows the other symbiotes are out there somewhere and that she'll keep trying until she finds them.\nAt the bus depot, Hank stands at the terminal as the Greyhound pulls in and the door opens, holding a sign reading \"Mr. Riot\". The Riot symbiote's new host - now clad in a dark blue suit - shakes his hand and says they shouldn't keep Senator Krane waiting.\nExiting the café, Flash and Andi walk down the street together; but as Flash says fighting Carnage within the Hive-Mind was a long-shot anyway Andi suddenly detects the presence of another symbiote. Plunging into the Hive-Mind, she sees the vague outline ofa red-and-black symbioteshe doesn't recognize, opening her eyes and recoiling in alarm just asToxinlands between her and Flash, cheerfully asking if they called him."

He based the armor's design loosely on his then-currentModel 4 Armor, only without many of the extra details (most notably the anti-gravity pods on each hip and the \"cuffed\" gloves and boots), making it very sleek and form-fitting. The helmet was similar to the Iron Man armor only without the mouth section, and a \"less human\" face compared to Stark's own armor. A flaw in the cybernetic control of the original design led to the original user, Stark's friendKevin O'Brien, being driven insane. In his unstable condition, Kevin soon became a pawn inSimon Gilbert's attempts to oust Stark from his own company. Stark was forced to don his Iron man armor and fight the Guardsman. Stark defeated the Guardsman, who tried to take refuge in an experimental tank. Stark tried to stop him without injuring him, so he shot the tank, but accidentally hit the fuel depot. The tank exploded and killed O'Brien.[1]\nWhen Kevin died, it appeared that the story was finally over. However, several months later the vacant armor was discovered, stolen, and donned by O'Brien's brother,Michael, an NYPD sergeant who wanted revenge on Stark and Iron Man, although he later decided that Iron Man was a hero who had no choice but to kill Kevin to save lives in danger. Michael O'Brien retained the armor (once the insanity flaw was removed) and became security head forProject P.E.G.A.S.U.S..[citation needed]\nThe armor was later put back into production byStane International. Stane sold a number of the armors to theVaultfor security. Oddly enough, Michael O'Brien was the security head for the Vault at the time. During thefirst Armor Wars, Stark was forced to use his negator packs to destroy the 41 known armors assigned to the Vault. Afterward, Stane International (under the control ofJustin Hammer) built replacement armors, but without Stark's Iron Man technology, and they were markedly inferior to the original suits. Stark Enterprises later entered into an agreement with the United States government to replace the Stane suits with superior new models, with security safeguards in place to prevent their misuse.[citation needed]\nEdwin Cordproduced modified versions of the Guardsman armor for theJury.\nDamage Controland theCSAalso worked on versions of the armor.[citation needed]"

Unleanshing a blast ofhellfirefrom herHell-Mark, Andi topples to the ground, struggling to breathe with a hole punched in her chest. IgnoringAgent Anti-Venomopening fire on him with a pair of machine guns, Phage gleefully prepares to finish Andi off only to be interrupted by the arrival of a pair ofGuardsmen, who command Agent Anti-Venom and Phage to surrender. Decapitating one of them, Phage sneers that all they do is talk while he wants to see some action.\nAt a care home, an elderly man with severe dementia lies in his bed lamenting the loss of his memories, leaving him in a near-vegetative state and unable to recall even his own name. AsSenator Krane's interview is broadcast on a TV, theLasher symbioteoozes from an air vent and bonds to him, telling the old man that he is now its home. The man's wife - who he no longer remembers - enters the room with a food tray and is pleasantly surprised to see him sitting up, saying the head nurse agreed to let her feed him; but as she prepares to feed him the Lasher symbiote sensesCarnage's call and engulfs him, knocking the woman aside with its tentacles.\nGleefully slaughtering the Alchemax Guardsmen attempting to subdue him, Phage mocks Agent Anti-Venom for his inability to save Andi. Pinned down by a pair of Guardsmen and an armed drone, Agent Anti-Venom destroys the drone and scoops Andi up before making a break for Dr. Steven's lab - begging her to hold on.\nAs Lasher rampages through the care home, killing everyone he comes across, Carnage reaches out to the symbiote through the Hive-Mind and tells it to join him, but the Lasher symbiote bluntly refuses and tells Carnage to leave it and its new host alone. Irritated, Carnage says he's not giving it a choice and pulls its host's consciousness into the Hive-Mind. Taking the form of a red-haired woman who the man - William - recognizes as a younger Suze, Carnage offers to help William fill the gaps in his memories if he does as he says. Ignoring the Lasher symbiote's warning that Carnage is tricking him, William agrees and plunges out a window, trampling everyone who gets in his way as he chases the hallucination Carnage implanted in his mind.\nIn Dr. Steven's lab, Flash begs him to help save Andi, asking if there was even a trace amount of theScream symbioteleft that they could bond her to. Holding up a canister containing a symbiote, Dr. Steven grimly states that what remained of the Scream symbiote was too badly-damaged to revitalize, but that was able to splice it withAnti-Venom Serumto create a new symbiote. Delerious, Andi grabs the canister and smashes - it believing the symbiote inside to be Scream, and as the white-and-red symbiote engulfs her she is shocked to hear its unfamiliar voice in her mind. As it covers her, Andi asks who the symbiote is and it replies that it is the absence of Scream --Silence. Taking over her and healing her wounds, the Silence symbiote ignores Flash asking Andi if she's alright by saying that it will take away her pain, introducing itself to him and Dr. Steven in the process.\nTrekking across the United States, William breaks into a gas station restroom mistaking a young man for his son. The Lasher symbiote again explains that Carnage is using his desire to regain his memories to manipulate him and that William fell for the trap and let Carnage in. Finally realizing he's been tricked, William laments that he wants to die, and Lasher informs him that his body has been dead for days.\nOnStaten Island,Bren Waterschannel-surfs as he and theToxin symbiotecomplain about the lack of quality television. Coming across a news bulletin about the attack onAlchemax Tower, Bret realizes his father is in danger - the Toxin symbiote engulfing him as they rush out to save him.\nAt Alchemax, Phage continues to brutalize the remaining Guardsmen, mocking their attempts to stop him until he's interrupted by the arrival of Silence - who admonishes him to only speak when spoken to. Attacking her, Phage asks if she's one of Alchemax's experiments, but she scolds him for not obeying and throws him through a wall. Introducing herself and quoting Carnage telling Andi that \"silence is golden,\" Silence presses a finger to Phage's face and he begins vomiting white froth. As the froth engulfs him, Phage attempts to flee but is thrown out a window by Silence, cratering the pavement below. AsMitchapproachesBuck Cashman's broken body and noses his hand, the Phage symbiote sloughs away from him and rebonds to the dog.\nAt theLincoln Memorialin Washington DC, Lasher watches a group ofFriends of Humanitymembers before announcing his presence. William asks the symbiote to release him and it obliges, his body spattering on the ground below. In the Hive-Mind, Willaim - now acodex- wonders why he's still alive. Mockingly thanking him for bringing Lasher intothe fold, Carnage appears and says he will keep his promise to reunite William with his family before killing him.\nAt Alchemax, Agent Anti-Venom approaches Silence as she stands looking out over the city and asks if Andi is OK, only for Silence to turn and stare incredulously at him.\nAt the Friends of Humanity rally in Washington DC, Senator Krane delivers another xenophobic rant, declaring his supporters that they may be from the silent majority but they will not be silenced any longer.\nWITNESS THE BIRTH OF A NEW SYMBIOTE!"

As she screams in pain, it rips out a chunk of flesh and sadistically croons that she tastes delicious. Kicking it off with her uninjured leg, she tries to limp away, but the Mania symbiote pursues her, mockingly stating that she'll never be able to escape it. As the Mania symbiote gloats that it's a part of her and she'll never be free, Andi looks down in horror to see living abyss oozing from her wound instead of blood, spreading up her leg and engulfing her body. Andi awakens with a gasp and sits up in bed, realizing it was just a nightmare - the fourth she's had that week. Surveying her messy room and getting dressed, she glumly congratulates herself on not having woken up screaming this time and wonders whether they're easing up or she's just getting used to them.\nIn the kitchen, Andi finds her Aunt Sarah making breakfast and opts for some toast. Sarah asks if Andi had another bad dream, but Andi - rummaging through the fridge - says that she slept like a baby. Eyeing her niece's can of pop disapprovingly, Sarah chastises Andi's poor eating habits, but Andi retorts that she's not a kid anymore. Sarah says that she knows, but that she's entitled to fuss over her niece for a while longer. Saying she wouldn't have it any other way, Andi kisses Sarah on the cheek and heads out to work.\nAs she walks down the street, Andi recalls how her nightmares began: inhigh schoolwhen she met her assistant gym coach,Flash Thompson-- aka thesymbiote-augmented supersoldierAgent Venom. Smiling sadly as she thinks about how bad her late mentor and father-figure had been at the whole superhero gig, Andi thinks to herself that she was just as bad -- not noticinga man in a red hoodiefollowing her. As she compares the loss of her symbiote to the phantom limb syndrome Flash had once described to her, she notices a group of friends and walks over to have coffee with them. As they chat, Andi thinks to herself that while she's not adjusting she's started to adapt and get her act together, making new, normal friends.\nLeaving to add more sugar to her coffee, Andi thinks to herself that having a degree of normalcy in her life eases the pain and that she might leave her nightmares behind her; looking up in shock as she hears the sound of slicing flesh. Turning, she sees the Mania symbiote slaughtering her friends, snarling that she'll never be free of it and that it will always be a part of her nesting inside her very cells. As Andi recoils in horror, a mass of tendrils bursts from her mouth. Coming to her senses, Andi realizes it was a hallucination, one of her friends asking if she's alright. Seeing her friends are OK, Andi says that she's alright. Andi bids her friends farewell, noting that their smiles and laughter are fake and that they're wondering what's wrong with her. Carrying a pair of coffees, Andi admits she can't blame them and that if she knew she'd tell them if she thought they could be chill about her having been a teenage vigilante.\nEntering a record store, Andi is scolded by her boss, Mitch, for being late again. Smiling appeasingly, Andi presents him with coffee but Mitch tells her that bribery will only get her so far. Mitch asks her if she got the coffee just the way he likes it, remarking that she's elevated tardiness to an artform. Andi quips that he should've known her in high school, taking his place at the register while he heads into the back room. Putting on her nametag, which she's altered to read \"Mania\", Andi thinks to herself that between the lulls in her hallucinations she can still feel the anxiety building. Andi's coffee cup suddenly topples over, the black liquid inside forming into the Mania symbiote, which snarls that she'll never be free. Mitch exits the back room demanding to know what's going on, only to be impaled through the chest by a tendril. Coming to her senses and realizing it was another hallucination, Andi runs out of the store -- ignoring Mitch's protests.\nWalking around town for a couple of hours to calm herself, Andi returns home hoping that her aunt hasn't found out about her ditching work, and that if she tells her about work then she won't be able to stop herself and would tell her aunt everything. Hopefully wondering if her aunt will be understanding, Andi spots Sarah sitting in the surprisingly dark living room. As Sarah tells her to come closer, Andi asks if Sarah is okay, recoiling in horror as Sarah's body rips in half, a mass ofred-and-black tentaclessurging out. As Andi stares, numbly telling herself that it's just a dream, another hallucination, Carnage climbs out of her aunt's hollowed-out corpse and mockingly offers to pinch her awake. On the verge of shutting down in horror, Andi numbly repeats to herself that it's not real until Carnage lashes out with a flurry of tendrils and lacerates her arm. Realizing it's not a hallucination, Andi flees but runs into an elderly neighbor who's walking his poodle. As her neighbor notices she's been hurt, Carnage impales him on a flurry of tendrils, Andi fleeing and wondering if her hallucinations were warning her, trying to protect her.\nAs she flees into a park, Andi recognizes that her pursuer is the symbiote-enhanced serial killer Carnage, mournfully wishing that Flash was there to help her. Carnage corners her, hissing that he can feel theremnants of her symbiotedeep inside her and asking if she has any last words. Tapping into herHell-Mark, Andi summons theMonsters of Evil-- demonically-enhanced monsters gifted to her byMephisto. As Carnage incredulously calls Andi \"freaky\", she sics the Monsters of Evil on him. Set ablaze by hellfire, Carnage begs Andi for mercy, stammering that she's killing him... before transforming his arms into blades and impaling Lord Tiki through the chest. As Andi incredulously wonders how Carnage survived when the flames should have turned his symbiote to ash, Carnage states that it was a nice try but that she's not the only one who's cursed. As Andi blasts him with more hellfire, Carnage notes that he was going to kill her quickly and painlessly, but now that she's pissed him off by fighting back he's going to make her suffer. As the Worm coils around him and starts constricting, Carnage roars that he'll make it rain their blood and guts, slicing her to pieces with a flurry of bladed tendrils. Declaring himself the Apostle ofKnull, Carnage snarls that he'll sacrifice Andi to the God of the Abyss.\nWreathing herself in hellfire, Andi tells him to bring it on and transforms into a demon - sporting black and red armor, horns, and hock-jointed hoofed legs. Conjuring a demonic pipe wrench, Andi bashes Carnage with it and shouts that she'll make him scream for killing her family and attacking her. Carnage snares her left arm with tendrils and breaks it, sneering that she's the one who's going to scream. Carnage tells Andi that he's after the remnants of the symbiote in her blood so that he can unleash the dark god Knull, Andi snarling that she'll send him to Hell. Knocking aside the remaining Monsters of Evil and stabbing them with tendrils, Carnage impales Andi and says that the more former hosts he devours the stronger he becomes, and that soon he'll apotheosize into a god. Skunk Ape rips Carnage away, Andi growing delirious from blood loss as hellfire blazes around her. Finding herself falling throughHell, Andi realizes that her Hell-Mark saved her to fulfill her destiny as a candidate for the Descent. As her demonic armor dissipates and she returns to human form, Andi realizes that there was no way she could have beaten Carnage on her own and worries about what will happen to the other symbiote hosts.\nHealing her wounds and opening a portal to New York, Andi sets out to find and warnEddie Brock- who was the Venom symbiote's host when they last met. Spotting a hallucination of her old symbiote, Andi smiles and acknowledges that it's still a part of her and always will be... though she can still sense Carnage clinging to her like phantom pain.\nStanding over the dismembered corpses of Gragoa, Skunk Ape, and Sphinx, Carnage mockingly remarks that Andi thought she could escape from him but that he can sense her presence no matter where she goes. Adding that he was planning to go to New York anyway, Carnage strolls through the hellfire cheerfully humming a tune.\n• For weeks, the serial killer called Carnage has been hunting former symbiote hosts and killing them.\n• Next on his list is ANDI BENTON, formerly MANIA, who’s back to living in Philadelphia and without any symbiote to save her…"

Además, Hank intuye que el senador Krane tiene un problema grave, ya que casi nunca parece parpadear ni respirar, y su mirada es siniestra y depredadora, como la de un tiburón. Al cerrar un trato con un representante de Nation West Airlines, el senador Krane sonríe amenazadoramente mientras le dice a Hank que no asista a su próxima reunión y que cuide de Buddy. Mientras Hank mira nerviosamente a los otros guardias de seguridad que le miran siniestramente,Arthur Kraneinterviene para informar a su padre de que su próximo invitado MVP llegará pronto. Al vetar que Arthur se ofrezca a ir a recogerlo, el senador Krane decide enviar a Hank en su lugar. En un flashback, un hombre con una camisa naranja y una gorra de béisbol sube a un autobús Greyhound y se sienta en la parte de atrás, con los zarcillos delsimbiote Riotrezumando alrededor de sus dedos.\nEn el laboratorio de astrobiología deAlchemax,Agente Anti-VenenoyDr. Stevense acercan cautelosamente aSilence. Retirándosesu simbiontede la cabeza, Flash Thompson pronuncia el nombre deAndi Benton, Silencio se lleva un dedo a la cara antes de reprenderlo para que lo llame por su apodo elegido. Flash reconoce al simbionte Silencio pero insiste en que le deje hablar con Andi para saber que está a salvo. Después de un momento de contemplación, el Silencio se retira de la cabeza de Andi Benton para revelar que está viva y bien, Andi entusiasmada por su victoria sobrePhage. Abrazándola, Flash dice que está feliz de que esté bien y que estaba aterrorizado de que fuera a morir. Sonriendo, Andi dice que sigue viva y que el simbionte del Silencio ya le ha curado la herida del pecho. La admiración de Andi por su nuevo aspecto y por lo poderosa que se siente es interrumpida por el Dr. Steven, que la sobresalta diciéndole con entusiasmo que le cuente todo, y le pregunta si la unión con Silencio se siente diferente a la unión conScream. Mientras suena una alarma, Flash dice que tienen que salir antes de que lleguen másGuardsmen, admitiendo el Dr. Steven que es un buen curso de acción. Mientras se alejan, Silencio le pregunta al Agente Anti-Veneno si tiene un plan, y el Agente Anti-Veneno responde que sí.\nTomando un café en una cafetería, Andi pregunta incrédula si el plan de Flash es confiar seriamente en su viejo amigo de la guerra, que fracasó en el ejército, quejándose de que nunca lo conoció y que incluso Flash admite abiertamente que es un desastre. Andi le pregunta si realmente espera que se encuentre con un arma Anti-Carnage, y Flash responde que Andi es el arma Anti-Carnage, recordándole que el toque limpiador de su nuevo simbionte cortó la conexión de Phage con la Colmena, y que ella podría hacer lo mismo conCarnagellevando la lucha directamente a él dentro de la Mente-Colmena. Alarmada, Andi protesta diciendo que ya ha luchado contra Carnage y que casi muere, que el simbionte Grito no ha podido resistirse a su dominio y que ha convertido la Mente-Colmena en su patio de recreo personal.\nEn el autobús Greyhound, Carnage llega al simbionte Riot a través de la Mente Colmena, haciendo que el interior del autobús parezca estar hecho de carne, huesos y entrañas. Al decirle a Riot que está organizando una reunión familiar y que quiere que esté allí, Carnage le golpea el hocico, infectándolo con su voluntad. El Riot infestado de Carnage sale del cuerpo de su anfitrión, matándolo, y procede a masacrar a los demás pasajeros del autobús mientras busca un nuevo anfitrión adecuado - Carnage lo anima alegremente a ser aún más brutal y despiadado.\nEn la cafetería, Flash le asegura a Andi que puede hacerlo, diciéndole que ha visto lo malvada que era como Silence, Scream, e incluso sin ningún simbionte. Dándole un empujón en la barbilla para que le mire, Flash le dice a Andi que es mucho más fuerte de lo que cree, y que Carnage no sabrá qué le ha golpeado. Con la ayuda de Flash, Andi se sumerge en la Mente-Colmena Simbionte como Silencio y desafía a Carnage para que venga a por ella, pero se sorprende al encontrarse flotando en un vasto y oscuro vacío. Cuando Flash le pregunta qué ocurre, Andi abre los ojos y le dice que no puede conectarse a la Mente-Colmena y que ésta ha desaparecido. Flash pregunta cómo es posible, y Andi especula que el Dr. Steven rompió o contaminó algo accidentalmente al crear el simbionte Silencio a partir de los restos del simbionte Grito. Flash insta a Andi a que lo intente de nuevo, pero ella se da cuenta de que no sólo es incapaz de sentir a Carnage, sino a \"ninguno\" de los otros simbiontes, ni aLasher, ni a Fago, ni aAgony, ni aRiot, ni siquiera aVenom. -- comentando que recuerda cómo se siente su presencia pero que su conexión se ha fracturado, corrompido o borrado de alguna manera.\nEn el autobús, Riot acorrala a un hombre con camisa azul, que le grita que se aleje de él. Comentando que no es demasiado grande ni demasiado pequeño, Riot establece un vínculo con el hombre y le dice que se siente bien.\nAl notar que Andi sangra por la nariz, Flash se disculpa por haberla presionado tanto, pero Andi replica que no se va a rendir, diciendo que sabe que los otros simbiontes están por ahí y que seguirá intentándolo hasta encontrarlos.\nEn la estación de autobuses, Hank se encuentra en la terminal mientras el autobús llega y la puerta se abre, sosteniendo un cartel que dice \"Sr. Riot\". El nuevo anfitrión del simbionte Riot -ahora vestido con un traje azul oscuro- le estrecha la mano y dice que no deberían hacer esperar al senador Krane.\nAl salir de la cafetería, Flash y Andi caminan juntos por la calle; pero mientras Flash dice que luchar contra Carnage dentro de la Mente-Colmena era una apuesta arriesgada, Andi detecta de repente la presencia de otro simbionte. Sumergiéndose en la Mente-Colmena, ve la vaga silueta deun simbionte rojo y negroque no reconoce, abriendo los ojos y retrocediendo alarmada justo cuandoToxinaterriza entre ella y Flash, preguntando alegremente si le han llamado.\nPuede que Carnage esté construyendo un ejército, pero su objetivo final sigue siendo un misterio. ¿Cuál es su objetivo final? ¿Y a cuántos masacrará para conseguirlo?"

Elektra then resurrected Abby the same way Stick resurrected Elektra. She later left Mark, Abby, and Stick in order to go her own way with a newfound appreciation for her 2nd chance at life.[2]"

В больнице он приходит в себя, где обнаруживает, что получил новые способности, которые полностью замещают зрение — у него усилились все остальные чувства, благодаря которым он стал понимать, что происходит вокруг. Спустя некоторое время, он возвращается домой, и начинает тренироваться при помощи своих новых возможностей. Благодаря этим тренировкам, он смог дать отпор своим обидчикам.

        "content": "DaredevilDirector:Mark Steven JohnsonWriter(s):Mark Steven JohnsonRunning Time:Theatrical Cut:103 min.Director's Cut:133 min.More InformationFull CreditsTriviaHome VideoSoundtrackMerchandiseCharactersDaredevilis a 2003 superhero film based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of the same name. Mark Steven Johnson directed the film, which stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, as well as Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Colin Farrell. The film follows Matt Murdock, a blind man who's a lawyer by day and a superhero by night. The film's budget was $100 million and the film grossed $180 million worldwide with $102 million coming from North America.\nAs a child, Matthew Murdock lived in Hell's Kitchen with his washed-up boxer father, Jack Murdock. Matt's father constantly reminds Matt to get an education and make something of himself, and not wind up like him. One fateful day, when young Matt takes a shortcut home, he stumbles across his father beating up a man at the behest of local mob boss Fallon. Horrified, Matt runs blindly away from the scene, and runs afoul of a forklift which swerves to avoid him and accidentally pierces a barrel of toxic fluid, drenching Matt's face in the substance.\nAn unspecified amount of time later, Matt awakens to find that he is blind. However, despite his loss of sight, his other four senses functioned with super-human accuracy, hearing and touch in particular. While Matt uses his radar-like hearing to train his body, his redeemed father decides to fight again in the ring. One night, Fallon approaches his father and orders him to throw the fight; when he does not, he is brutally murdered by a shadowy figure later revealed to be the Kingpin. Matt is heartbroken by his father's death.\nMany years later, Matt Murdock is operating as the Daredevil, whom the press dubbed as The Man Without Fear, at night, and lawyer during the day, protecting Hell's Kitchen in particular. The Kingpin's numerous criminal activities have finally been picked by the press, and he decides to implicate his former partner Nicolas Natchios and make it appear that he was the Kingpin. Matt is intrigued when he meets Elektra Natchios, and despite her initial distrust of him, the two soon begin a relationship. While traveling with her father one night, they are attacked by the lethal and unstable assassin Bullseye, who was dispatched by the Kingpin. Despite Daredevil's best efforts, Bullseye kills Nicholas Natchios with Daredevil's billy club and implicates Daredevil, enraging Elektra, who swears revenge, since she only saw Daredevil during the fight.\nLater, when Daredevil goes in search of Bullseye, he runs into Elektra, and reluctantly fights her. When Elektra impales Daredevil through the shoulder with one of her sai blades, she unmasks him and gazes at Matt in horror. Bullseye suddenly turns up, Elektra attempts to fight him and Daredevil can only watch helplessly (with his Radar Sense) as Bullseye kills Elektra. The first scene of the film is shown again, as Daredevil enters the church, intending to recuperate and recover his strength. Unfortunately, Bullseye tracks him down, and the two battle ferociously across the church with Bullseye gaining the upper hand after discovering Daredevil's weakness to loud sounds. After Bullseye manages to knock the air out of Daredevil, he raises a jagged metal pipe to kill him. Using his prodigious hearing, Daredevil hears a S.W.A.T. officer cock his rifle and times it so that his bullet fires horizontally through both of Bullseye's hands, incapacitating him. Daredevil then violently throws the assassin through a church window, and watches him plummet to the ground with grim satisfaction.\nDaredevil then goes to the Kingpin's Headquarters for a climatic battle. Despite his appearance, the Kingpin turns out to be a powerful fighter; he overpowers Daredevil throughout most of the fight and eventually unmasks him. Daredevil loses sight of Kingpin, and bursts a pipe so that the rushing water would allow his radar hearing to see his enemy, and bring the tyrant to his knees. When Daredevil is about to deal the final blow, he contemplates what it means to be a hero, and offers the Kingpin a sardonic smile as he awards him his life. He informs the Kingpin that he is aware that he won't be imprisoned indefinitely, and as he leaves, tells him that he will always be waiting for him. He offers one final thought before departing, and orders the Kingpin to stay out of Hell's Kitchen. When Kingpin threatens to reveal Daredevil's identity, Daredevil taunts him in return with the fact that Kingpin got beaten by a blind man, which would make him the laughing-stock of the underworld. The Man Without Fear left before the crimelord swears vengeance against him.\nThe next morning, Matt and his law partner are drinking coffee at the shop, reading the newspaper on Fisk. Matt turns to the door when a woman enters at the shop, in a scene similar to the one introducing Elektra. Matt says he's going for a walk, and leaves. He goes to the roof of his apartment and finds a copy of Elektra's necklace hanging, with Braille on it. At his office, Ben Urich is writing his latest story, an expose on who Daredevil really is. He's about to print it, but then, out of respect for Daredevil's engagement, decides to delete his story. He exits the New York Post office into the night outside and sees Daredevil standing at the rooftop. Urich whispers \"Go get them, Matt\" to which Daredevil nods his head and takes off, leaping off the building to fight another hoodlum.\nHalfway through the film's credits, police are guarding a hospital room. Inside the room, Bullseye, now heavily bandaged is annoyed by a fly. Off camera, the fly is struck with a syringe on the wall. Bullseye says one word out of the side of his mouth: \"Bullseye\".\nThe film was shot in Los Angeles, California and New York City, New York."

Elektra is revived by her Kimagure master,Stick, who trains her then with his group of ninjas, The Chaste. The Kimagure training is the one which allowscontrolling past, present, and future, andreviving the deatheven. However, Elektra is expelled off the group, before finishing her training. And so the story of this movie begins when Elektra is a mythical assassin, slaying DeMarco with one of her Sai daggers, in his own manor.\nElektra is engaged then in a new job to slay a still undisclosed subject. She moves to the area, an insular one, abiding in a big residence. Then, she sympathizes with a 13 year old girl, Abby, by whom Elektra becomes a friend of her father, Mark Miller. However, Elektra's orders arrive and the victims result precisely to be both Miller and his child. Then, the confused Elektra refuses to go on, ready to abandon the area. About boarding the ferry, she perceives some killers around, through her Kimagure intuition. Effectively when she gets to Miller's house, two assassins have gotten there. Elektra stops them, discovering theirOrder of The Handaffiliation, and then she escapes with Abby and her father.\nOn the way, Elektra gets to a pool club to meet her master, Stick, who would help against The Hand. She learns that the actual victim is not Mark but Abby, indeed. The child is coveted by the evil members of The Hand, to become one amongst them, because she is the mythicalTreasure, a warrior who could tip the balance of good and evil.\nThe leader of The Hand dispatches his own son,Kirigi, to deal with the intervention of Elektra. Kirigi convenes some powerful henchmen:Tattoo(who endows life, to the animal figures which are designed over his skin),Typhoid(who spreads death over all living creatures on her way),Stone(who is of a super strength), Kinkou (who moves with a great speed).\nAfter an eagle of Tattoo spotted Elektra at the pool club, Kirigi finds Elektra, Abby, and Miller, at the farmhouse of McCabe, the man who manages Elektra's assignments usually. McCabe is slain but Elektra and the group reach a nearby forest through an underground passage. Elektra defeats Stone, crushing him timely with a falling tree. With her father, Abby manages to defeat Kinkou. Then, the little girl surprises Elektra showing martial arts skills, and using her large bracelet (Indonesian warrior beads) for an effective weapon vanquishing two wolves of Tattoo. However, Typhoid succeeds affecting Elektra who gets paralyzed by a poisonous kiss of her. Timely, the Kimagure army of Stick arrives and The Hand is routed.\nAt Stick's camp, Elektra is totally healed and she learns that he would have commanded Elektra to murder Abby. Yet, all was a test which has just been passed. Meanwhile, Abby expresses her sickness being so reclusive amongst the Kimagure, for getting a normal life. Elektra agrees a final duel then with Kirigi. The winner gets Abby.\nThe duel takes place at Elektra's childhood house. After dispatching a group of ninjas, Elektra faces Kirigi in a room full of flying white clothes. There, she realizes finally that Kirigi had been the killer of her mother. However, Elektra is overwhelmed by his attacks and as she is about to be slain, Abby surprisingly enters into the battle saving her life.\nOutside the house, in the green maze yard, also Tattoo and Typhoid confront Elektra. Tattoo unleashes a multitude of serpents which surrounds Abby despite her desperate usage of her special bracelet. Elektra stops him though, breaking his neck. Also, Elektra defeats Kirigi, who is stabbed by her Sai dagger, falling down into a well, to turn into dust at the bottom.\nTaglines:\nMuch like the Daredevil film that preceded it, Elektra did not garner the warmest reaction from critics and fans, and it was regarded as a box office failure. It did, however, sell well on DVD. A slightly more polished 2-disc edition director's cut DVD was released in October 2005. On Rotten Tomatoes, ten percent of the critics gave the film a positive review with an average rating of 3.7/10.[5]"

He's splashed by some radioactive biohazard material in an accident, which blinds him. He learns to overcome this disability and developing a kind of 'sixth sense' which allows him to \"see\" by using sound waves to create a mental image of his surroundings. His father is murdered by theKingpin, and Murdock vows to avenge him.\n\nThe film was regarded as a modest success at the box office, although it did not make as much money as theX-MenandSpider-Manfilms. Though the original production was geared towards a darker, more adult film, the success of the then just releasedSpider-Manprompted Fox to curb the more mature elements and re-envision the film as a summer action vehicle in mid-production.\nFan and critical reactions were mixed at best. Much disapproval was heaped upon Ben Affleck for his performance as Daredevil, whom many fans felt was not right for the role. Besides Ben Affleck, there was mixed fan reaction to the increased budget for CGI effects and retooling of the tone. There was also a small amount of controversy concerning the casting of African American actor Michael Clarke Duncan as the villainous Kingpin, whose traditional comic ethnicity was of Anglo-European descent. Jennifer Garner, who playedElektra, fared slightly better, however, and won her own spin off,Elektra, but it did poorly at the box office. The highest praise went to Colin Farrell, whose portrayal of the maniacal Bullseye was well received by fans and critics alike (an ability he has demonstrated in many movies).\nDaredevil's premise departed from what has been established in the long-running comic book series. In the film, Daredevil is a vigilante who has no problems executing criminals who escape justice (although he changes his ways by the end of the film). In the comic series, Daredevil is a principled individual who believes in upholding the rule of law above all else. His principles in the comics have led to conflicts with other superheroes such asSpider-Man,Wolverine, and thePunisher, and, as his alter ego Matt Murdock, sometimes defend the criminals he catches in court.\nA glaring error in the film is the nature of the courtroom trial shown at the beginning. Matt Murdock is a defense lawyer working in a private practice. The film depicts him prosecuting an alleged rapist. This would actually be done by a government prosecutor, not a private attorney, unless it was a civil trial, although this would be inconsistent with many other details in the film.\nDavid Fear of MSN Movies ranksDaredevilas the second worst superhero movie to date, behindBatman and Robin.[1]Roger Ebert's review rated it favorably compared to other superhero films.[2]\nIn December 2004, a director's cut of the film was released on DVD. This version added 30 minutes of footage not seen in the original, including an entire subplot involving Murdock defending a murder suspect played by rapper Coolio, which allows Foggy to uncover evidence of the Kingpin's true identity. It also won quite a few more fans than the initial theatrical release.\nThe following scenes were deleted that were featured in the PG-13 cut of the film:\nMichael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin\nThe following additions were made:\nDaredevil: The Albumwas released in 2003 by Wind-Up Records for the movie Daredevil, starring Ben Affleck. All songs were previously unreleased, and some songs appeared on later releases. Unlike later Wind-Up soundtrack releases, many songs from Daredevil: The Album notably appeared in the film.\nThe album was one of the first collaborations between Marvel Comics and Wind-Up Records, which would continue with the releases of Fantastic Four and the Daredevil sequel/spin-off Elektra. Three singles were released from the album: Fuel's \"Won't Back Down\", The Calling's \"For You\", and Evanescence's \"Bring Me to Life\", the first major appearance by Evanescence which would lead to \"Bring Me to Life\" reaching number one on the Billboard Chart.\nThree songs were omitted from release on the album: N.E.R.D.'s \"Lapdance\", Dara Shindler's \"Faraway\", and House of Pain's \"Top o' the Morning to Ya\".\nOther appearances:"

He's splashed by some radioactive biohazard material in an accident, which blinds him. He learns to overcome this disability and developing a kind of 'sixth sense' which allows him to \"see\" by using sound waves to create a mental image of his surroundings. His father is murdered by theKingpin, and Murdock vows to avenge him.\n\nThe film was regarded as a modest success at the box office, although it did not make as much money as theX-MenandSpider-Manfilms. Though the original production was geared towards a darker, more adult film, the success of the then just releasedSpider-Manprompted Fox to curb the more mature elements and re-envision the film as a summer action vehicle in mid-production.\nFan and critical reactions were mixed at best. Much disapproval was heaped upon Ben Affleck for his performance as Daredevil, whom many fans felt was not right for the role. Besides Ben Affleck, there was mixed fan reaction to the increased budget for CGI effects and retooling of the tone. There was also a small amount of controversy concerning the casting of African American actor Michael Clarke Duncan as the villainous Kingpin, whose traditional comic ethnicity was of Anglo-European descent. Jennifer Garner, who playedElektra, fared slightly better, however, and won her own spin off,Elektra, but it did poorly at the box office. The highest praise went to Colin Farrell, whose portrayal of the maniacal Bullseye was well received by fans and critics alike (an ability he has demonstrated in many movies).\nDaredevil's premise departed from what has been established in the long-running comic book series. In the film, Daredevil is a vigilante who has no problems executing criminals who escape justice (although he changes his ways by the end of the film). In the comic series, Daredevil is a principled individual who believes in upholding the rule of law above all else. His principles in the comics have led to conflicts with other superheroes such asSpider-Man,Wolverine, and thePunisher, and, as his alter ego Matt Murdock, sometimes defend the criminals he catches in court.\nA glaring error in the film is the nature of the courtroom trial shown at the beginning. Matt Murdock is a defense lawyer working in a private practice. The film depicts him prosecuting an alleged rapist. This would actually be done by a government prosecutor, not a private attorney, unless it was a civil trial, although this would be inconsistent with many other details in the film.\nDavid Fear of MSN Movies ranksDaredevilas the second worst superhero movie to date, behindBatman and Robin.[1]Roger Ebert's review rated it favorably compared to other superhero films.[2]\nIn December 2004, a director's cut of the film was released on DVD. This version added 30 minutes of footage not seen in the original, including an entire subplot involving Murdock defending a murder suspect played by rapper Coolio, which allows Foggy to uncover evidence of the Kingpin's true identity. It also won quite a few more fans than the initial theatrical release.\nThe following scenes were deleted that were featured in the PG-13 cut of the film:\nMichael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin\nThe following additions were made:\nDaredevil: The Albumwas released in 2003 by Wind-Up Records for the movie Daredevil, starring Ben Affleck. All songs were previously unreleased, and some songs appeared on later releases. Unlike later Wind-Up soundtrack releases, many songs from Daredevil: The Album notably appeared in the film.\nThe album was one of the first collaborations between Marvel Comics and Wind-Up Records, which would continue with the releases of Fantastic Four and the Daredevil sequel/spin-off Elektra. Three singles were released from the album: Fuel's \"Won't Back Down\", The Calling's \"For You\", and Evanescence's \"Bring Me to Life\", the first major appearance by Evanescence which would lead to \"Bring Me to Life\" reaching number one on the Billboard Chart.\nThree songs were omitted from release on the album: N.E.R.D.'s \"Lapdance\", Dara Shindler's \"Faraway\", and House of Pain's \"Top o' the Morning to Ya\".\nOther appearances:"

En un accidente es salpicado por un material radiactivo de riesgo biológico, que lo deja ciego. Aprende a superar esta discapacidad y desarrolla una especie de \"sexto sentido\" que le permite \"ver\" utilizando ondas sonoras para crear una imagen mental de su entorno. Su padre es asesinado por elKingpin, y Murdock jura vengarlo.\nAños más tarde, Murdock trabaja como abogado enHell's Kitchen, convirtiéndose por la noche en el justiciero conocido como Daredevil. Busca y castiga a aquellos a los que no puede dañar en la sala. Lucha contra el crimen en soledad hasta que conoce aElektra. Murdock se encariña con Elektra y se familiarizan el uno con el otro. Después de que el padre de Elektra sea asesinado por el asesino del Kingpin,Bullseye, ella cree que el asesino es Daredevil, y lo busca. Armada con dosSais, lo vence en una pelea y se da cuenta de quién está detrás de la máscara. Entonces lucha con Bullseye en su lugar, quien la mata. Daredevil venga la muerte de Elektra y supuestamente mata a Bullseye lanzándolo a través de la ventana de una iglesia para que caiga sobre un crucero de la policía. Daredevil entonces lleva la lucha a Kingpin, golpeándolo severamente en su propia oficina. Daredevil le perdona la vida a Kingpin, incluso cuando éste le promete que saldrá de la cárcel en algún momento. Durante una escena de créditos, se muestra a Bullseye en un ala del hospital, recuperándose lentamente y todavía capaz de matar (una mosca).\n\nLa película fue considerada un éxito modesto en la taquilla, aunque no hizo tanto dinero como las películasX-MenySpider-Man. Aunque la producción original estaba orientada a una película más oscura y adulta, el éxito de la entonces recién estrenadaSpider-Manhizo que Fox frenara los elementos más maduros y replanteara la película como un vehículo de acción veraniego a mitad de la producción.\nLas reacciones de los fans y de la crítica fueron, en el mejor de los casos, dispares. Ben Affleck fue objeto de gran desaprobación por su interpretación de Daredevil, que muchos fans consideraron inadecuada para el papel. Además de Ben Affleck, los fans reaccionaron de forma desigual ante el aumento del presupuesto para los efectos CGI y el cambio de tono. También hubo una pequeña controversia en torno a la elección del actor afroamericano Michael Clarke Duncan como el villano Kingpin, cuya etnia tradicional en los cómics era de ascendencia angloeuropea. Sin embargo, a Jennifer Garner, que interpretó aElektra, le fue un poco mejor y consiguió su propio spin off,Elektra, pero le fue mal en la taquilla. Los mayores elogios fueron para Colin Farrell, cuya interpretación del maníaco Bullseye fue bien recibida por los fans y la crítica (una habilidad que ha demostrado en muchas películas).\nLa premisa de Daredevil se apartó de lo establecido en la larga serie de cómics. En la película, Daredevil es un justiciero que no tiene problemas en ejecutar a los criminales que escapan a la justicia (aunque cambia su forma de actuar al final de la película). En la serie de cómics, Daredevil es un individuo con principios que cree en la defensa del estado de derecho por encima de todo. Sus principios en los cómics le han llevado a tener conflictos con otros superhéroes comoSpider-Man,Wolverine, yPunisher, y, como su alter ego Matt Murdock, a veces defiende a los criminales que atrapa en los tribunales.\nUn error flagrante de la película es la naturaleza del juicio que se muestra al principio. Matt Murdock es un abogado defensor que trabaja en un despacho privado. La película le muestra procesando a un presunto violador. En realidad, esto lo haría un fiscal del gobierno, no un abogado privado, a menos que se tratara de un juicio civil, aunque esto sería incoherente con muchos otros detalles de la película.\nDavid Fear, de MSN Movies, califica aDaredevilcomo la segunda peor película de superhéroes hasta la fecha, por detrás deBatman y Robin.[2]Roger Ebert's review rated it favorably compared to other superhero films.[3]\nEn diciembre de 2004, se publicó en DVD una versión del director de la película. Esta versión añadía 30 minutos de metraje que no se veían en la original, incluyendo toda una subtrama en la que Murdock defiende a un sospechoso de asesinato interpretado por el rapero Coolio, lo que permite a Foggy descubrir pruebas de la verdadera identidad del Kingpin. También se ganó bastantes más fans que la versión inicial en cines.\nSe eliminaron las siguientes escenas que aparecían en el corte PG-13 de la película:\nMichael Clarke Duncan como el Kingpin\nSe hicieron las siguientes adiciones:\nDaredevil: The Albumfue lanzado en 2003 por Wind-Up Records para la película Daredevil, protagonizada por Ben Affleck. Todas las canciones fueron inéditas y algunas canciones aparecieron en lanzamientos posteriores. A diferencia de los lanzamientos posteriores de la banda sonora de Wind-Up, muchas canciones de Daredevil: The Album aparecieron notablemente en la película.\nEl álbum fue una de las primeras colaboraciones entre Marvel Comics y Wind-Up Records, que continuaría con los lanzamientos de Fantastic Four y la secuela / spin-off de Daredevil, Elektra. Se lanzaron tres sencillos del álbum: \"Won't Back Down\" de Fuel, \"For You\" de The Calling y \"Bring Me to Life\" de Evanescence, la primera aparición importante de Evanescence que llevaría a \"Bring Me to Life\" número uno en la lista de Billboard.\nSe omitieron tres canciones del lanzamiento del álbum: \"Lapdance\" de N.E.R.D., \"Faraway\" de Dara Shindler y \"Top o 'the Morning to Ya\" de House of Pain.\nOtras apariciones:\n"

Setting out to become an artist, he published his first work inThe Twilight Zonefor Gold Key Comics in 1978. More penciling work followed for anthology titles from DC Comics and his first work at Marvel Comics inJohn Carter Warlord of Mars#18.\nAt Marvel, Miller settled in as a regular fill-in and cover artist, working on a variety of titles. A pivotal fill-in job was onSpectacular Spider-ManPeter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man#27andPeter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man#28. These stories featuredDaredevilas a supporting character, who at the time was considered a B-list superhero with a poorly selling title. However, Miller saw something in the character he liked and asked editor in chiefJim Shooterif he could take over Daredevil's regular title. Shooter agreed, and Miller became the new penciller on the title.\nMiller's first issue ofDaredevilwasDaredevil#158, which was the last part of an ongoing story written byRoger McKenzie. Although mainly conforming to traditional comic-book styles, Miller infused this first issue with his own film noir style, which proved to be a success. After this issue Miller became one of Marvel's fastest rising stars and also started plotting stories with McKenzie. His artwork was highly detailed but still noirish as his run progressed. Learning fromNeal Adams, Miller would sit for hours sketching the roofs and streets of New York in an attempt to give hisDaredevilart an authentic feel not commonly seen in superhero comics at the time.\nBeginning withDaredevil#168in 1981, Miller took over the writing duties as well, withKlaus Jansonproviding inks. This issue saw the first appearance ofElektra, a character who would become incredibly popular in her own right. Meanwhile, Miller had madeDaredevilso successful that it went from a bimonthly to a monthly title withDaredevil#171.\nOver the months, Miller gradually infused the stories with darker themes and stories heavily influenced by Japanese manga. Some stories failed to pass the Comics Code Authority censor in their original forms. This trend peaked inDaredevil#181when the assassinBullseyekilled Elektra. Although deaths of supporting characters were commonplace in comics at the time, the death of a major character like Elektra was not. Miller made it clear in the next few issues that he intended Elektra to remain dead; nonetheless, he resurrected her later.\nMiller finished his Daredevil run withDaredevil#191. In his time he had transformed a secondary Marvel character into one of the most popular and best-selling characters, while Miller himself had become the industry's hottest creator and was in high demand.\nAlso during this time, Miller and writerChris Claremontproduced a four-partWolverineminiseries, spun off from the popularX-Mentitle. Miller used this solo appearance to expand on Wolverine's character and to feature his manga-influenced art more explicitly. The series was a critical success and further cemented Miller's place as a major talent. Miller found time to draw a shortBatmanChristmas story for a DC Comics Christmas special. He would become closely associated with this character as well as with Daredevil.\nhttp://frankmillerink.com/"

TheFixer (Roscoe Sweeney)sent young Turk to payJack Murdockhis fee for working for him. Jack did not want to take Turk along with him on his next job which angered Turk.[3]\nHe was a member of theThunderbolts Gang. They thought themselves as revolutionaries, they were merely common criminals.[4]The group had ties to theZodiac Cartel.\nThe gang attempted to force war veteranBillie Carverto join the gang. When he refused, they nearly beat him to death. Lonnie Carver, Billie younger brother was a student ofLuke Charleswho asked him for help. Luke was really theBlack Pantherand defeated them in time to save Billie. Panther teamed up withDaredevilto investigate the gang which Billie had joined. They found the gang but Turk managed to catch the Panther at gunpoint, forcing them to surrender.\nHowever, Billie pulled a gun on Turk. Daredevil used the distraction to knock the gun from Turk's hand, but he had another gun shooting Billie in the arm before Daredevil could knock him out.[4]\nTurk was kicked out of the gang and gained employment with assassinEric Slaughter.Bullseyehired them to kill Daredevil, knowing they would fail so he could monitor his skill. They toldFoggy NelsonandMatt Murdock, that they needed to meet Daredevil at the pier. Hoping to trap Daredevil in an ambush however he ambushes them, taking them out one by one.[5]AtJosie's Bar, Turk saw Matt investigating the location of Bullseye. Turk attempted to rob him, butJosiepulled a gun on him instead. Matt warned him to tell Bullseye that Daredevil was looking for him.[6]Turk went to warn Eric, but this allowed Daredevil to follow Later, Bullseye ordered Eric and his men to kill Daredevil but he refused due to his growing respect for the hero.[7]Turk was homeless on the streets posing as a blind man, he was confronted by Daredevil, who wanted information onAlarich Wallenquist. But before he could say anything someone threw an explosive at them and Daredevil got them both to safety.[8]After the Wallenquist affair, Slaughter fired Turk from his gang.[9]\nMauler armor\nTurk spent quite a bit of time atJosie's Barin New York City. His primary associate was \"Grotto\" who often reluctantly participated in Turk's schemes. Daredevil met with him again at Josie's beating him to find out about the contract on theKingpin's life.[9]Matt returned to the bar again and Turk and Grotto took him to the Kingpin at gunpoint. Fisk agreed to hire the men and told them to shoot Matt and throw him in the river. But they left him alive and dumped him in the sewer instead.[10]Daredevil interrogated him again about the Kingpin. Turk then went to Fisk telling him Daredevil was after his files. Fisk had his men move fake files, which Daredevil stole.[11]Not long afterwards, Barrett stole theMauler Armorin an unsuccessful attempt to confront Daredevil.[1]\nTurk and Grotto dressed as clowns tried to capture Sheldon, a man who had copies of checks paid from the Kingpin to crooked mayoral candidateRandolph Cherryh. They chased Sheldon on top of a parade balloon, but Daredevil leaped from above and bounced Sheldon off the balloon, where he was caught by a waitingLuke Cage.[12]Turk debated cutting the Kingpin out of the share of the money, but decided against it as he would surely hunt him down and kill him. Turk showed up with a leg cast and a crutch, but was knocked out by Daredevil.[13]\nHe was imprisoned onRyker's Island, and was present when thePunishercame to interrogateBullseye. He warned him to stay away from Bullseye, but upon recognizing the Punisher he ran off.[14]Turk and Grotto broke out of Ryker's Island the same night the Punisher did. Turk saw as the Punisher made his way to a rope ladder dropped from a helicopter. Grotto decided to surrendered, but Turk grabbed onto the end of the rope ladder. He tried to convince the Punisher that they should join forces, but the Punisher severed the ladder, and Turk crashed into the water below.[15]\nHe tried to get his old job back from Slaughter, but he refused. After Daredevil made it appear that Guts Nelson (Foggy in disguise) had taken out all the goons, Slaughter offered Turk his old job back if he killed Nelson. Turk instead sided with Nelson and then brought him to the Kingpin, proposing him to be his next master assassin. Guts Nelson got out of the situation with Daredevil's help, and then he took Turk with him on a plane bound forChicago. Nelson got off the plane just before it took off.[16]\nStilt-Man\nTurk later stoleStilt-Man's Battlesuit. He offered his services to the Kingpin but was declined. The Kingpin contended that he did not employ \"idiots\". The original creator of the Stilt-Man armor,Wilbur Day, contacted Daredevil with knowledge of how to defeat Barrett.[2]\nTurk tried to mug a drunk on a subway platform, but it was revealed to be Daredevil, who questioned him about the location of a woman trying to evidence against the Kingpin. After he leftIron Manarrived trying to findDr. Octopus. Turk claimed to know nothing, but as Iron Man left he shouted calling Doc Ock a \"four-eyed creep,\" however he did not realize that the pole he was leaning on was actually one ofDoctor Octopus' Tentacles.[17]\nTurk once mugged a \"Santa\" at Christmas and intended to use the Yuletide attire to swindle charitable donations from others. In this instance when he was confronted by a disoriented Matt Murdock, Turk stabbed Murdock seriously, almost fatally, wounding him.[18][19]\nDaredevil interrogated Turk at Josie's Bar, forcing him to give him information on the Mondats. Daredevil then used him to rescueMrs. MondatfromVictor. Daredevil then used Turk to distract the Kingpin's men as he tried to rescueDr. Mondat. As Daredevil knew Turk would betray him, he had the goons fire into the elevator but he escaped allowing him to rescue Dr. Mondat.[20]\nTurk later attempted to take on Daredevil, but ended up getting thrown through the window ofJosie's Bar. He however used a grenade, which he tossed at Daredevil, however he swatted it back, blowing up Josie's. Matt arranged forDamage Controlto rebuild the bar.[21]\nHe continued working for the Kingpin, and took a point beating from theEnforcerswho were now working forHammerhead. He had his baby momma meet withMichael \"Man Mountain\" Marko&Typhoid Maryfor him. Turk had to meet withTony Starkwhen the Kingpin refused to meet him after tricking him into taking out Hammerhead's criminal army.[22]\nTurk later went on to work withMr. Fear. He sent his men to pick up theGladiatorso he could go on a killing spree throughoutChinatown. He then had his men deliver Mr. Fear's drug's all over Hell's Kitchen.[23]Turk began to worry that Mr. Fear had gone too far and caused Daredevil to become more violent. Turk subsequently allied withThe Hood. The Hood decided to let Daredevil lead him to Mr. Fear so he and his guys could finish whichever of them was still standing.[24]Turk was on the phone when Daredevil threatened to hurt him, wanting information on who was running the docks. He reported with laughter that he was doing so.[25]\nWhen the Kingpin returned he had Turk show him to the new Josie's Bar, which had moved to a new underground location. They tried to turn him away until they saw Fisk. The Kingpin appointed Turk as his lieutenant. He was sent to approach Murdock, who wanted to learn the location of the Kingpin.[26]In aHandwarehouse full of bodies, he warned Kingpin of the cops, but when asked how the Kingpin was doing, Fisk seized him by the throat and warned him to never ask that again.[27]Turk caught the Kingpin talking to himself when he showed theOwlin to his office. On a run to pick up donuts for the Kingpin, he thought how lucky Grotto was to be in prison.[28]After Fisk and Owl capturedDakota North, they sent Turk to deliver a message to Murdock's doorstep. After all he had seen, Turk was convinced Kingpin had lost his mind and gone crazy so he told Matt where Dakota was.[29]\nWhile driving throughGreenwich Villageworking a scam as a ride-sharing driver in Manhattan, Turk stumbled into a fight between the alienSkrullsand group of monks that were trying to deliver theMind StonetoDoctor Strange'sSanctum Sanctorumfor safekeeping. Barrett got ahold of the Mind Stone in the middle of the battle, and decided to use it for his own goals after feeling a taste of its power. Turk escaped with the Stone while the two combating forces finished killing each other.\nTurk used the power of the Mind Stone to build a criminal empire in hopes to fill the void left by Kingpin's absence. He gained loyalty and money from fellow criminals he helped using the new powers at his disposal, like mind-controlling judges into changing verdicts. When Daredevil caught notice of Turk's new powers and goals, he warned him about trying to play in the big criminal leagues.[30]Doctor Strange eventually caught notice that Turk possessed the Mind Stone,[31]but opted against taking it from him by force since he believed it might be his fate to wield the gem.[32]"

        "content": "While possessing tremendous physical strength and resiliency, the power Fisk wields through his numerous gangs and criminal employees is even more daunting. An intelligent man, Fisk makes sure to never place himself in a situation in which the law can prove his responsibility for crimes, using middlemen and hired crooks to do his bidding.\nWhile he does not discriminate in who he clashes with in his never-ending power quest, the three most common foils to his plans areSpider-Man,Daredevil, andThe Punisher."

Jednym z jego zadań było zabicie Jacka Murdocka, znanego również pod pseudonimem \"Diabeł\". Fisk wykonał zadanie. Lata później, Wilson przejął władzę nad mafią. Udało mu się ukryć swoją przestępczą działalność przed ludźmi. Pojawiały się jednak pogłoski o Kingpinie, ale większość ludzi uznała to za mit. Wilson wynajął Bullseye, by zabił Nicholasa Natchoisa. Najemnik zadanie wykonał, ale Fisk uznał, że powinien zabić również rodzinę zmarłego, dla tego zlecił Bullseye'owi zabić również Elektrę oraz Daredevila, który przeszkadzał mu w interesach. Najemnik po rzekomym zabiciu Elektry, został zmuszony przez Daredevila, by powiedział mu kto jest Kingpinem. Dowiedziawszy się kto jest Kingpinem, Matt ruszył by pozbyć się Fiska, lecz gdy miał do tego okazję nie zrobił tego. Wilson został pokonany i najprawdopodobniej wylądował w więzieniu."

        "content": "Wilson FiskAlias(es)KingpinStatusAlive(incarcerated)Appeared inDaredevilActorMichael Clarke Duncan\nWilson Fisk, also known as theKingpin, is a New York City based crime lord and central antagonist to Daredevil. He started out as a enforcer for a Mobster named Fallon, and later became a powerful businessman in legal and criminal operations. He operated from a New York building and had his own company called Fisk Corp.\nWhen Wilson Fisk was a young man, he started out his criminal career as an enforcer for a mob boss named Falon, in which capacity he was hired to killJack \"The Devil\" Murdockafter he refused to throw a fight. Years later, after Fallon died of natural cause, Fisk became his successor and a crime boss in his own right and successfully hid his criminal activities from the public, although the media picked up on reports of a \"Kingpin\", running all crime in the city. He hiredBullseyeto killNikolas Natchios(attempting to frame Natchios as the Kingpin in the process). He was successful, but Fisk also wanted Natchios' family killed as well and hired Bullseye to kill Natchios' daughter,Elektra, as well as the troublesomeDaredevil. After he supposedly killed Elektra, Bullseye lost to Daredevil, although he revealed that Fisk was really the Kingpin during the fight. Having learned of his assassin's failure, Daredevil and Kingpin confronted each other in a final showdown.\nDue mainly to his injured shoulder - stabbed by Elektra when she believed him to be her father's killer - Daredevil was severely beaten by Fisk, who unmasked him, revealing that Daredevil was really \"the blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen\", Matt Murdock, who Kingpin met at the party that took place prior to Nicholas Natchios' death. Daredevil nevertheless managed to make a comeback, triggering the sprinkler system in Fisk's office - thus allowing him to better \"see\" his opponent while rendering Fisk practically blind - and subsequently paralyzing Fisk by sliding behind him and breaking his kneecaps. Daredevil prepared to kill Fisk to take revenge for his father and for Elektra by impaling him with a steel pike, but let the Kingpin live so as not to stoop to his level.\nInstead, Daredevil left Fisk for the police, who had learned of his identity as the Kingpin after one of Fisk's henchmen had been caught by the police. Fisk threatened to tell everyone who Daredevil really was, until Daredevil pointed out that revealing to his prison inmates that he had been beaten by a blind man was the equivalent of suicide. Nevertheless, Kingpin swore that he'd get out of jail soon and that he'd be back to kill Daredevil, who merely said he would be waiting."

Años más tarde, Fisk se convirtió en un jefe del crimen por derecho propio y logró ocultar sus actividades delictivas del público, aunque los medios recogieron los informes de un \"jefe\", ejecutando todo el crimen en la ciudad. Pero, la mayoría solo lo consideró un rumor urbano. Kingpin contrató al asesinoBullseyepara asesinar aNikolas Natchioscuando después de años de asociación, Natchios intentó terminar su amistad. Tuvo éxito, pero Fisk también quería matar a la familia de Natchios y contrató a Bullseye para matar a la hija de Natchios,Elektray tambien asesinar al heroeDaredevil.\nDespués de que supuestamente Bullseye asesinara aa Elektra, Bullseye fue vencido por Daredevil, aunque reveló que Fisk era realmente el Kingpin durante la pelea. Tras enterarse del fracaso de su asesino, Daredevil y Kingpin se enfrentaron en un enfrentamiento final. Debido principalmente a su hombro herido, apuñalado por Elektra cuando ella creía que él era el asesino de su padre, Fisk lo golpeó con fuerza, quien lo desenmascaró, revelando que Daredevil era realmente \"el abogado ciego deHell's Kitchen, Matt Murdock, quien Kingpin conocio en la fiesta que tuvo lugar antes de la muerte de Nicholas Natchios. Sin embargo, Daredevil logró hacer una reaparición, activando el sistema de rociadores en la oficina de Fisk, lo que le permitió \"ver\" a su oponente mientras dejaba a Fisk prácticamente ciego y, posteriormente, derribando a Fisk y rompiéndole las piernas. Daredevil se preparó para matar a Fisk para vengarse de su padre y de Elektra atravesándolo con una pica de acero, pero dejó que Kingpin viviera para no rebajarse a su nivel. En cambio, Daredevil dejó a Fisk a la policía, que se había enterado de su identidad de señor del Crimen. Fisk amenazó con decirles a todos quién realmente era Daredevil, hasta que Daredevil señaló que revelarle a sus internos que había sido vencido por un ciego era el equivalente al suicidio. Sin embargo, Kingpin aseguro que pronto saldría de la cárcel y que volvería a asesinar a Daredevil, quien dijo que lo estaría esperando.[1]\nFisk ha demostrado una gran fuerza en su pelea contra Daredevil.\nA pesar de que tiene mucha fuerza, esto lo hace lento, debido a eso Daredevil logro vencerlo con sus rápidos reflejos.\nLimusina\nBastón"
