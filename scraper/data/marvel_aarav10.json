This was considered by the locals a small price to pay for peace with that dark and sinister god. Their minaret's dome was open, to allow the Night-God to enter his temple.[2]\nOne of the women offered as sacrifice was impregnated by the Bat-God, and gave birth to the bat-winged humanoid hybridNight-Goddess.\nWhile the priestess' father was away on a pilgrimage,[3]the Night-God was killed byConanand the priestessHajiiwas slain byJenna.[2]\nThe cult went on despite their god's death, but became theCrow Cult. Some cultists wore the same red robes but were now assisted in battle bycrows, while other members wore crow costumes and could emit deafening shrieks. They kept on sacrificing young maidens to their god, nowMa'kannta, God of the Talon. They presented themselves as theBastard Children of theAkah Ma'at, forced into hiding, and wishing to free Ma'kannta from his demonic realm prison, for him to protect them, and thus enabling them to reclaim the skies over Shadizar.[1]The exact nature of their relation to the Akah Ma'at, if it really exists, remains unrevealed.\nAs Conan and the time-displacedScarlet Witchtracked bandits who had stolen aNight Shard, a piece of theOlympiangoddessNyx's soul, those bandits were attacked by night-cultists and crows, who looted the Shard away.\nThey used the Night Shard, the \"Ebon Key\", for itseldritch powerto free Ma'kannta, through a girl's sacrifice. Though Conan prevented the girl's death, the Shard still cut her, and the blood spilled was enough to return Ma'kannta from its demonic realm prison. Conan battled the crow cultists and the god, possibly slaying all of cultists, until the Shard was detected by Nyx. She intervened, along with herChildren of the Nightseemingly killing Ma'kannta or return him to his realm.[1]The heroes, rejoined by otherAvengersthen battled Nyx and her ilk among the corpses of the Crow cultists.[4]\nWhen the priestess' father returned from pilgrimage, he found the temple destroyed, the order dissolved, and learned of his daughter's and his god's deaths. According to their people's beliefs, no new incarnation of their god would come to them nor answer their prayers until the deaths caused by Conan were avenged.\nTheNight-Cultreturned, led by the priestess' father, and rebuilt the tower, though only of wood, feeling they weren't worthy till their honor was revenged. During the next two years, the cult sacrificed a female upon the altar, and sometimes heard the flapping of wings, though no god ever came, as the Night-Goddess did not care for women. They purchased theLotusmany of their worshipers required for their visions fromYatha.\nTwo years later, their sacred assassins followed Conan after he slew Yatha and burned his warehouse. As Conan'sFree CompanionsfledKothand camped in Zamora, near Shadizar, a cultist recognized Conan atMaldiz's tavern. The Night-Cult attacked their camp a couple days later, capturing the \"God-Slayer\".\nHe was placed on the altar, and it \"the Night-God\", in fact the Night-Goddess, appeared to take the male sacrifice. She wished to take her as mate, but Conan believed she would fed him to her spawn afterwards, and decided to attack them. Conan slew the Night-Goddess, only to realize she was only taking him away from her hatchings, as any mother would.[3]\nThe whereabouts of the Night-Cult afterwards remains unknown.\nThe so-called Bastard Children of theAkah Ma'atcould emit a deafening shriek.\nRed robes with a hood with a stylised skull on the front.[2][1]Crow costumes[1]"

In 950 AD, he attacked theAsgardiansseeking to take their power for his own, but was defeated byThor.

        "content": "Witchblade (Artifact)Biographical InformationAlias:DigitabulumThe BalanceRace:Primordial BeingGender:MaleStatus:AliveCharacter InformationAffiliation:The Darkness (father)The Angelus (mother)Hope Pezzini (half-sister via Sara Pezzini)Real World InformationFirst Appearance:Witchblade Issue 1\nTheWitchbladeis a conscious, intelligent, and ancient weapon with supernatural origins. It is one of13 mystical artifacts, of which twelve have been revealed:the Witchblade, the Angelus, the Darkness, the Ember Stone, the Glacier Stone, the Rapture, the Blood Sword, the Spear of Destiny, the Coin of Solomon, the Heart Stone, Pandora's Box, and the Wheel of Shadows.\nIt is the offspring of the universe's two opposing aspects, the Darkness and the Angelus (Light). The Witchblade is a male aspect created to act as a balance, which must have a female as a host, but has not spoken aloud as of yet.\nThe Witchblade is the offspring of the universe's two primal forces, the Angelus and the Darkness. To avert mutual destruction, a truce was struck. The Angelus and the Darkness consummated and, in so doing, conceived the Witchblade, creating peace and balance between them.\nThe Witchblade was discovered in modern times in Greece byKenneth Irons, but before he found it, it had many wielders. When not in use, it can look like an ornate, jewel encrusted, right-handed gauntlet. When wielded by an unworthy user, that person will lose their arm. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the host, who can hear the Witchblade. When used, it expands across the body of the wielder, often shredding clothes and covering the body like armour. The amount and coverage of the armour depends on the level of the threat.\nFor example, when facing mortals, it will usually generate less armor than when facing a demon of Hell. This armor can produce extensions of itself that can form swords, other stabbing weapons, hooks, chains, shields and wings, enabling the wielder to fly. It may also become temperamental if the wielder chooses not to use it. When wielded, it can shoot energy blasts from the hand or sword, fire projectile darts, and whip-like grapples to attack or climb structures. The Witchblade is also an excellent lock pick, and can heal wounds, even mortal ones. The Witchblade can reanimate the dead, empathically show the wielder scenes of great trauma, and allow the wielder to relive experiences from past wielders in the form of dreams.\nFollowing the events in theFirst Bornmini-series, the Witchblade was split into two parts. One half belongs to Dani while Sara has reclaimed the other half. However, the Witchblade, originally being the balance between the forces of Darkness and Light, it was revealed in the recentWar of the Switchbladesaga/arc that each half of the Witchblade represented one of the two primal forces: Sara having the Darkness one and Dani the Angelus. This led to changes in the personality of the characters, especially Sara. Encouraged by the leaderless Angelus Warriors and the mysterious Tau'ma, both wielders eventually ended up in all-out war for the complete control of the Witchblade, which concluded with Sara victorious and once again in control of the full Witchblade. She now possesses the full Witchblade, as Dani is now the host for the Angelus.\nThe Witchblade is said to possess a male personality, with several of its characteristics involving the shredding of its wielders' clothing in the generation of protective and revealing armor. The Witchblade is able to pick locks and will become temperamental in cases where its wielders prefer not to use it.\nIn the live-action series, the Witchblade possesses many of the same powers as its comic book counterpart, but manifests differently. In this case, it assumes the form of a metal gauntlet with a red gem that resembles an eye. It has gone by several names across different cultures, including Digitabulum Magae (Latin for \"The Witch's Finger\").\nWhen in use, the Witchblade could produce a blade from the wrist end of the gauntlet form, was durable enough to withstand bullets, and transform into a pata (a sword blade connected to a gauntlet). Towards the end of the first season, including the pilot film, the Witchblade could produce a full suit of armor to cover the wielder's body, but rather than appearing organic like in the comics, the armor resembled the kind worn by medieval-era knights.\nIn at leastone episode, the Witchblade demonstrated organic features, but only when its host was undergoing the Periculum, a trial to determine if she was worthy of the Witchblade, and upon completing the trial, it returned to its bracelet form.\nIn two other episodes, the Witchblade demonstrated the ability to transform itself into a transitional stage between its bracelet form and a form resembling knuckles, enabling the wielder to punch people without harming themselves.\nAccording to Kenneth Irons in the series' pilot film, the Witchblade possesses many powers. Among them was the ability to enable the wielder to win people's hearts. This implies the wielder possessing the ability to win the trust of those around her.\nAccording to Ian Nottingham in the last episode of the series, who likely learned of it from Irons, the Witchblade will not and can not be used to kill anyone that has wielded it before, being only capable of harming them.\nAccording to Sara in the last episode, the Witchblade is a state of the mind and the heart. She also implied that the Witchblade can be wielded by anyone if it were ever rendered vulnerable and therefore accessible in one of its weapon forms.\nThe Witchblade is sentient and responds to the bearer's will, as well as attempting to impose its own.\nIn reverse chronological order (fictional chronology, not publication dates) save non-canon and alternate realities:\nOther identified wearers include Cathain, who is remembered as an Irish Celtic war goddess by history in the live action TV series of the Witchblade. Cathain is connected to the historical Irish Celtic King, Conchobar.\nAlternate Reality\nNon-Canon\nIn reverse chronological order:\nThe Witchblade that was found by Alex Underwood is a different one than the one we know of. The Witchblade appeared to Alex after she was fatally surprised by the husband of a client. The Witchblade healed Alex of her wounds and bonded with her. Here, the Witchblade in idle mode is a metallic wristband instead of a bracelet.\nIn the 2024 reboot, the Witchblade is not a gauntlet but a bracelet that turns into a kind of spider. It is not directly owned byKenneth Irons (Reboot), even if it is searched for by him. In Berlin, Germany, it is in a buried box. When one of the employees finds the Witchblade, he takes possession of it directly. Chased by Irons and his men, the Witchblade changes hosts several times and ends up in the USA, New York. And from there to its new ownerSara Pezzini (Reboot).\nWitchblade (Artifact)/Gallery"

Elected to four terms in office, he served from 1933 to 1945 and was the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Presumably, the fictional character's history is mostly the same as his real life counterpart. The scope of this article is to cover the activities of the fictional character and his interactions in theEarth-616universe. For a full history of the real life FDR, consultWikipedia.\nAs early as 1939, before the United States officially entered into the war, Franklin Roosevelt kept interested in theNaziswar machine was creating. Hearing of the Nazi'sProject: Nietzsche-- an attempt to create a super-soldier -- Roosevelt had money secretly invested in attempts to create super-humans as well. Among these wasPhineas Horton'sinvention of theHuman Torch. While meeting with officials aboard the yacht owned by his millionaire friendVincent Astor, Roosevelt learned of the implications of the android, that it would burst into flames, and also of the Nazis's latest operation: dropping depth charges into theSargasso Sea.[2]\nSoon super-humans began cropping up all over America, fighting Nazi spies and other menaces seeking to destabilize the United States before the country entered the war. The first recorded encounter that Roosevelt had with these so-called \"Marvels\" was when he congratulatedProfessor Philo Zogolowskifor using his robotElectroto defend America fromZombiescreated byDr. Bruno Varoz.[3]Roosevelt later personally thanked theSub-Marinerfor destroying a fleet of Nazi battleships.[4]\nLater that year, the United States government began their own version of Project Nietzsche calledOperation Rebirthto create an army of American super-soldiers. OnSeptember 14, 1940in a secret meeting with state officials, Roosevelt sanctioned the creation of a robot calledTESS-Onea robot constructed to eliminate super-soldiers that might go rogue, before the project was put underway.[5]\nOn Roosevelt's birthday, he became a target of Nazi spies who sent him the bodies of military officials who were shrunk to doll size. Learning of this, theTerrortracked down the Nazis and shut them down.[6]\nWhen Project Rebirth yielded the creation ofCaptain America.[7]Roosevelt met with the new hero, awarded him with a new costume and shield before introducing him to the press.[8][9][10]Roosevelt also later introduced Captain America's new partnerBuckyto press as well. During this conference, Roosevelt was captured by the Sub-Mariner who wrongly accused the United States for the wars toll on his people. Roosevelt convinced Namor of his nobility and eventually both the Sub-Mariner and Captain America fought off a Nazi sub before returning Roosevelt to the White House.[11]Later, Roosevelt commended Captain America and Bucky for stopping the Nazi spies known as theUnholy Legion.[12]\nSoon after, the Sub-Mariner rallied with other undersea races to renew aggressions towards the surface world. In response, Roosevelt mobilized American troops to deal with the threat, but ultimately, Namor was stopped by the Human Torch.[13]\nOnNovember 22, 1941another attempt to assassinate Roosevelt was thwarted by Captain America and Bucky.[14]\nFollowing the attacks onPearl HarborbyImperial JapanonDecember 7th, 1941, the United States' formally entered intoWorld War II. President Roosevelt stood in theUnited States Congressand proclaimed December 7, 1941, \"a date which will live in infamy\".[15]He later called a meeting withBritishPrime Minister;Winston Churchill.[15]\nEarly in 1942, President Roosevelt hosted Churchill's extended visit to the United States and Canada to discuss the ongoing war effort.[16]Later that year, when the majority of theInvaderswere put under the hypnotic control of theRed Skull, Roosevelt was briefed of the situation by theFBI. WhenBuckyforced an audience with the President, he asked for assistance in rescuing his friends. However, Roosevelt discouraged the boy from taking action, telling him that war was no place for a youth.[17]Bucky eventually proved Roosevelt wrong by not only forming theLiberty Legion,[18]and rescuing the Invaders.[19]\nOnJune 19, 1942, Roosevelt and Churchill met once again for a private meeting about the war effort. The Invaders were on hand to protect the two leaders from an attack by two Nazi agents using an experimental growth formula.[20]Their one-on-one meetings carried on untilJune 22ndof that year.[21]\nLater that year, when American ambassadorJohn Lissamwas revealed to be the Nazi spy known as the Creeper, President Roosevelt stepped in to sign a treaty between the United States and the nation of Alslavia, one of the last few neutral countries during the war.[22]\nWhen seven good will ambassadors destined to the South American nation ofBonarawere murdered by theAmbassador of Terror, Roosevelt sanctioned theYoung Alliesto go in their place, succeeding in security a trade deal to export rubber from the country.[23]Roosevelt later sent an official directive sending Captain America and Bucky to Hollywood, California to investigate Axis sabotage at Democracy Pictures, where a serial about Captain America was being filmed.[24]\nRoosevelt soon became the target of a series of assassination attempts in 1943. The first was plotted by Nazi agent theCobrawho sought to eliminate Roosevelt, Churchill andJoseph Stalinduring a meeting out in the Atlantic. This plot was foiled by the Sub-Mariner.[25]The next attempt was by Nazi assassinJorgen Kline, who attempted to kill Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin during a meeting in Tehran. This second attempt was soiled byNick Furyand hisHowling Commandos.[26]\nYet another plot by Nazi spies was foiled by thePatriotin 1944.[27]Later Roosevelt personally greeted the Howling Commandos during a Heroes Welcome ceremony during one of the groups brief returns to the United States following a mission behind German lines.[28]\nWhen in a meeting in the West Indies, Roosevelt became a target of Nazi scientist theZombie Masterand his army ofZombies. This assassination attempt was prevented by the Sub-Mariner.[29]Later, when alighthouse keepers attendantobtain a meteor fragment that could be used as a destructive weapon and offered it to the highest bidder, Roosevelt suspected that the Nazis and the Japanese might use trickery to obtain the weapon. To prevent this, Roosevelt sent Captain America and Bucky to insure that if the weapon did not end up in American hands, it was to be destroyed.[30]\nWhen Captain America was captured by the Red Skull andWarrior Woman, military officials met with Roosevelt to explain the situation. With the risk of Captain America being killed and his death being used as Nazi propaganda, Roosevelt agreed to a secret plan that would see a man of similar physical characteristics take up the role of Captain America so that his death could be denied and Americans not lose faith.[31]While this protocol was not used during Roosevelt's Presidency it was later used when Captain America was believed to have been killed.[32][33][34]When Cap was returned, he and Roosevelt soon held a press conference with the media.[35]\nShortly before his death in 1945, Roosevelt and his wife Elanore listened to the Masked Raider radio program.[36]\nOnApril 12, 1945Franklin Roosevelt died from complications due to a stroke. When Captain America and Bucky learned of the news, Cap suggested that they wait until the war was over before they mourned the passing of the President, and draw inspiration from his life to win the battle.[9]Roosevelt was succeeded by Vice PresidentHarry S. Trumanwho took up the Presidency following Roosevelt's death and led America through the reminder of the war."

Wishing to protect their power, the Atlantean council of sorcerers tried to harness a fraction of the power of theAxis Mundi, but were unable to control the energies, causing theGreat Cataclysm[6][5]or rather furthering it.[5]\nDuring theHyborian Age of Conancirca 10,000 BC, the (fair-skinned)[7]Amazonslived in theValley of the Amazons[3](or \"Hidden Valley\"), in the fabledSecret City of the Amazons,[4]inHyboria. The custom of slaying their male mates,[3]as well as any male from entering their domain, was already law to those Amazons. Those Amazons held a death-match arena known as the Circle, in which the victorious survivor mated with the Queen before she slew him.[4]\nWhenConanwas let free byQueen Brynwho showed him the secret tunnel out of the city after their mating,Mabtook the lead, imprisoning Bryn and hunting Conan. Conan himself stumbled onto the vanguard of theLegion of Freebooters, that had come to plunder the valley and sell the Amazons into slavery.[3]The Amazons pursuing Conan reached him at this moment and a fight broke, in which Conan turned on the Freebooters to letDanaewarn Bryn. They returned and timely stopped Mab from executing Bryn for having violated the law of the Circle. Meanwhile, a survivor of the Freebooters dragged the horde ofMalekhar the Morose. Conan slew Malekhar, and swore to never reveal the tunnel leading to the Amazons' domain before departing. Mab shot at him with a her bow to respect the law of the Circle and Conan left, believed dead, in fact protected by Danae's shield on his back.[4]\nAt least three other groups of women warriors were known as Amazons in Hyboria in the same era (their relations to the Amazons, if any, remains unrevealed):\nTheAmazonsofGamburu\nSeveral thousand years later, the Amazons founded their own city,Themiscyra, on theThermodon River(inmodern-dayTurkey). Hippolyta, daughter of the Amazonian queenOrtreraand ofAres, theOlympian godof war, was born (nearRiver Tanais, near modern-dayRostov-on-Don,Russia).[16][5]Some account have Otrera described as the first queen of the Amazons.[16]Echidna stated that, despite the Amazons being the offspring ofAres, she always thought them to be as her own.[2]\nLysippesucceeded to her mother Ortrera as queen of the Amazons, but was killed in combat. Hyppolita then succeeded to her sister.[16][5]\nIn 1270 BC,Herculeswent toThemiscyrato steal thegirdleof Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, a gift from Hippolyta's father Ares, as part of hisTwelve Labors. However the moment the two met it was an instant attraction and the two went to bed together. This happiness from Hercules angeredHera, who took the form of one of the Amazons, and made them believe Hercules was kidnapping their queen. He escaped completely naked, carrying the girdle and chased by the countless Amazons.[17]\nLater, Hippolyta used arcane magic to invert the gorgons' stone-making abilities and turned a statue into flesh, her daughterArtume, aiming at the creation of a more perfect offspring.[16]\nHippolyta was eventually killed in a hunting accident by her sisterPenthesileia. She soon grew in fear of her people's reproaches and was haunted by theFuries, who tormented those who killed their kin. Along twelve fellow Amazons (Clonié,Polemusa,Derinoè,Evandrè,Antandrè,Bremusa,Hippothoè,Harmothoè,Alcibiè,Derimacheia,AntibrotèandThermodosa), Penthesilea came toTroyin order to cleanse her soul and helpKing Priamin theTrojan War.\nTricked byAthena(who favoredAchillesof theAchaeans), Penthesileia led both her Amazons and the Trojans, galvanized by the warrior woman. Despite killing many warriors, the Amazons were all slain, Penthesilea falling last after facing Achilles. Ares was enraged but forbidden to intervene, while Achilles' heart was drown in sorrow (from one fist blow, he slewThersites, who mocked his mourning.[18]The feats of the Amazons were witnessed byCole, aNeanderthalwith an extended lifespan.[19]\nThe Amazons came to exist inOlympus, where they were the most-fiercely trained warrior. Hippolyta resumed her rule as Queen of the Amazons.[20]\nTheir whereabouts in the following years are unrevealed, butHerculesstated they did \"run a little wild every hundred years or so.[21]\nIn theModern Age, Hippolyta still harbored passion for Hercules. She was recruited byPlutointo enterring an arranged marriage with Hercules, in order to prevent him from interfering with Pluto plans of conquering Olympus.[16]The Amazons were among many, along withHarpies, that stormed theU.C.L.A. Campusthrough portals, looking for Venus (whileCerberusand theMutateswent after Hercules), culminating with Ares, Pluto and Hippolyta appearing before them and their allies, stating thatZeushad decreed that Hercules was to marry Hippolyta and serve as her prince consort and thatVenuswas to marry Ares, or the universe would die.[20]This event helped start upthe Champions of Los Angeles, who ultimately foiled Pluto's plan.[16]\nThe Amazons, including Artume andDelphyne(an Amazon gorgon), fought inOlympusalong theOlympiansand against the invadingdemonhordes ofMikaboshi. Artume's resolve for conquer sprang out from the fighting.[22]\nArtume killed Hippolyta and rewrote reality, using the AtlanteanOmphalos, to have the Amazons rule the world. This plan was foiled by Delphyne who killed Artume.[16]\nGorgon succeeded Artume as the Amazonian queen, and inherited Hippolyta's seat on Hera'sOlympus Group.[16]\nHelabargained with theDeath-Lordsto have Hippolyta resurrected, more powerful, in exchange for her owing each of them a favor, \"The Twelve Labors of Hippolyta\" (which Hippolyta interpreted as the Death-Gods wishing to have her ascend to Ares' throne and bolster the ranks of the dead). She first foughtDoom Maidensfor Hela. She was then urged by Pluto to restrengthen the Amazons' ranks.\nHippolyta foundedNew Amazoniain the middle of theMediterranean Sea, and started raising an army and nation of warrior women (including Delphyne Gorgon), though intending them not as pawns in the warmongering of gods, and declared that New Amazonia would persist for eons. On Delphyne's account, some Amazons did not share Hippolyta's view and craved for a more destructive purpose.\nNew Amazonia was soon visited by the Doom MaidensAradneaandEchidnaalong with a quintet of giant sea monsters. They clashed with Hippolyta and theDefenders, until Aradnea deliveredCaroline Le Fay's message calling the Amazons to join her and sate their craving for bloodshed, leaving the Amazon nation in doubt.[2]\nWade WilsonandThrenodywent to New Amazonia as part of a paid mission on behalf ofWeaselto acquire Hippolyta's bust from the Amazonian temple, and were confronted by the queen and her Amazons, though managed to steal the bust and flee.[23]"

On one occasion Lester went to his mother for solace, telling her, \"They made fun of me. They called me names. They're all a bunch of monkey-mouths!\" Strangely enough, Mrs. Verde thought that \"monkey-mouths\" was a very original and funny expression, and complemented Lester on it, saying, \"You know, I wanted to be a writer when I was growing up. If I'd had your talent for making up names, maybe I would've been. The pen is mightier than the sword, you know.\" This hackneyed observation had a profound effect on young Lester, who raced upstairs and began writing invective against his tormentors. In the third grade, Lester went on a field trip to the offices of his local newspaper and decided to become a reporter in order to wield power over others with his writing. Years later Verde became a journalism student in college, intent on making a career out of sensationalistic stories. After his teacher, one Professor Furgen, challenged Verde's journalistic ethics in class, the vengeful student wrote an expose in the school paper accusing him of involvement in a drug scandal. In fact, Furgen had obtained an illegal drug, for the first time in his life, to keep himself awake while writing an important paper under deadline, but Verde wrote the article in such a way as to make Furgen's offense seem far more serious. As a result of the ensuing scandal, Furgen lost his tenure and was even divorced.[2]\nWhile in college, Verde also took a life drawing class in which his fellow student,Beverly Switzler, served as a model on four occasions. Infatuated with Switzler, Verde, who had avoided women before now except for his mother, boorishly tried to pick Switzler up, only to be angrily rejected. Again seeking revenge, Verde informed the parents of Switzler's boyfriend, David, about their son's relationship with her, portraying it in lurid terms. David's parents forced him to leave school, and David subsequently died in a car crash while driving back to the school through a blizzard to visit Switzler. After college, Verde made a career as an investigative journalist for various tabloids dealing in alleged scandals. Verde fantasized that his growing fame would impress Switzler, but heard nothing from her. In fact, she had long ago forgotten him. He decided to change careers, hoping to attract her notice and became a rock music critic for a Midwestern newspaper.[3]\nHoping to become a celebrity through his writing, Verde arranged to become a performer with Mildred Horowitz and his Band, a popular rock group known for their spectacular stage shows. Verde planned to write a book exposing the band as alleged purveyors of decadence. Significantly, considering Verde's later career, large bells were tolled on-stage during the band's shows. Verde played the Easter Bunny in the show, a symbol of innocence that the band pretended to try to kill in on-stage mock fights. One night, however, the fight went out of control and Verde's left hand was accidentally severed by the prop guillotine used on-stage.[3]\nAs yet, nothing more has been revealed about how Lester Verde became the costumed criminal Doctor Bong. Hence, it is unknown how, and why Verde adopted his costumed persona or how he gained his extraordinary knowledge of genetic engineering and sonics.\nSome years ago, Doctor Bong captured Beverly Switzler and her companion, the sentient other dimensional waterfowlHoward the Duck, while they were on a cruise in the Atlantic Ocean. Bong held them prisoner at his castle, which at first was situated on an island in the Atlantic but which somehow was transported to a site in the Himalaya Mountains during this time. Still obsessed with Switzler, Doctor Bong demanded that she agree to marry him or else he would kill Howard. Switzler agreed, but Bong nevertheless used his skill at genetic manipulation to transform Howard into a human being (albeit one with only four digits on each hand). Bong then forced a sea captain to marry him to Switzler.[4]\nHoward escaped Bong's castle and eventually regained his original avian form. As for Switzler, Bong never consummated his marriage with her, preferring to spend his nights reciting Edgar Allan Poe's classic poem \"The Bells.\" Wearing a suit of armor filled with weaponry, Howard finally did battle with Doctor Bong, who easily defeated the courageous bird. Switzler, however, surreptitiously used Bong's own laboratory to create five infant clones of the insane geneticist from one of Bong's nail clippings, which she called the Bong Quintuplets. Switzler then confronted Bong and demanded that he spare Howard's life or else she would publicly accuse Bong of being a negligent father toward his children. Unwilling to see his image thus besmirched, Bong teleported Switzler and Howard from his Himalayan castle back to Cleveland, where they lived.[5]\nDoctor Bong took custody of the quintuplets and has cared for them ever since. Presumably, his marriage to Switzler has been annulled. Nothing had been heard of Doctor Bong since his last confrontation with Howard until recently, when he clashed unsuccessfully withJennifer Walters, the She-Hulk.[6]\nHe gave up his criminal ways to obtain a Phd. in psychology. His first patient wasDeadpool, who came to him for treatment after the events of the Dead Reckoning.[7]\nHe later confronted Deadpool andSteve Roger'sSecret Avengerswhere it was revealed that he continued to work as shrink for Deadpool for some time.[8]At the end of the battle, he was defeated and Deadpool cut off his metal ball hand.[9]\nDoctor Bong was one of the many villains kidnapped into a roller derby by theGrandmaster. The bulletproof nature of Bong's helmet was a vital part of the heroes' winning plan.[10]\nHe later attended a support group called Villains Anonymous that was held at a church and also attended byBoomerang,Hippo,Porcupine,Grizzly,Looter,Mirage, and others. At another Villains Anonymous meeting, Grizzly and Looter talked about their run-ins with Spider-Man.[11]"

Conan decides to take the treasure himself and quickly takes care of the two incompetent thieves (who are parodies of Fritz Leiber's famous characters Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser). He enters a bar and strikes up a conversation with an attractive local wench named Jenna. After getting punched in the face, Conan leaves with Jenna, who has more or less attached herself to the barbarian, or perhaps the surprising amount of gold in his purse. She takes Conan to her \"uncle\", Maldiz, a blacksmith, so he can melt down Conan's suspicious-looking gold coins into a new shape. Word has spread about the earlier robbery, and both Jenna and Maldiz put two and two together. With his now untraceable gold in his purse, Conan takes a moment to enjoy Jenna's company under a palm tree, but that quickly ends when he's knocked unconscious from behind by a trio of red-robed men. Curiously, they take only the girl and leave the gold behind. Conan seeks help from Maldiz, who recognizes Conan's description of the men and declares Jenna lost. The men are followers of the Night-God, who sacrifice a young girl every month to their evil lord. Conan heads towards their temple, steals a robe, and enters the evil cult's lair. He arrives just as the Night-God's priestess, Hajii, completes her prayer and puts out the brazier, plunging the open-roofed temple into darkness. Conan battles first the ultrasonic noise of the ritual, then the fanatics and uncovering the brazier discovers the secret of the Night-God: It is a giant bat-like creature who swoops in to devour its sacrifice. It grabs Jenna in its claws, but Conan leaps onto the monster's back with Hajii. All three humans are flown into the sky. Conan thrusts the brazier repeatedly into the beast's eyes and body, while Hajii desperately tries to stop the barbarian from slaying her god. Conan is victorious, and the monster plunges to the ground, leaving Conan insensible long enough for Hajii to pull a dagger to strike in vengeance. Luckily, the priestess forgets about Jenna, who knocks Hajii out with the brazier before Conan can be killed. However, in a final twist, Jenna, taking advantage of Conan's disoriented state, lulls him to sleep. When Conan wakes, he discovers that Jenna and the gold are long gone."

A suitably impressedRoy Thomasgave him the job of drawing an issue of X-Men, but with no studio and having been kicked out of his hotel, Windsor-Smith was forced to do the work sitting on park benches. The resulting pages secured Windsor-Smith further work with Marvel, even though he was sent back to England within the year as he had no work permit.\nInitially credited as Barry Smith, he rose to prominence in the early 1970s as the original penciller for Marvel Comics' adaptation of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian character. At first drawing in a manner lifted fromJack Kirby, within a couple of years he developed a unique style for comics at the time, borrowing from pre-raphaelites such as Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti (whose influence would saturate Windsor-Smith's artwork even more in later years). Along with writer Thomas, Smith adapted the Howard short stories \"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\", \"Tower of the Elephant\", \"Rogues in the House\", and \"Red Nails\". During their run together, Thomas and Smith also created original adventures and characters as well, including the flame-haired warrior-woman,Red Sonja, loosely based on Red Sonya, a character from one of Howard's non-Conan stories.\nShortly thereafter, Smith left comics, added Windsor to his professional name, and began to pursue a career in fine art (although he has returned to the comics field several times since). Granted residential status in theUnited States, Windsor-Smith in 1974 set up Gorblimey Press, through which he released limited-edition prints of fantasy-based subjects that proved popular. As well, he was one of the four comic book artists-turned-fine-illustrator/painters who, along with Jeff Jones, Mike Kaluta and Bernie Wrightson, formed a small artist's loft commune in 1975 known as \"The Studio\". By 1979 they'd produced enough material to issue a handsome art book under the name \"The Studio\", which was published by Dragon Dreams.  By this point, Windsor-Smith had fully embraced a symbolist and Pre-Raphaelitism aesthetic.\nWindsor-Smith returned to Marvel in the 1980s as the artist of a Machine Man limited series, and as the writer and artist of the serialized \"Weapon X\" feature inMarvel Comics Presents.  The latter was Windsor-Smith's own, original conception of the origin of the X-Men character Wolverine. During this period he also produced a well-regarded story featuring The Thing and Human Torch that was published inMarvel Fanfare.\nIn the 1990s, Windsor-Smith was at the peak of his powers. He produced work for a start-up company named Valiant Comics. Within only two years Valiant rose to become the third most powerful publisher. Windsor-Smith was the chief designer of the \"historic\" UNITY crossover for Valiant Comics. Before Valiant was sold to video game giant Acclaim Entertainment for $65 million, Windsor-Smith left Valiant.\nHe did some work for Malibu's Ultraverse line as well as for Dark Horse Comics. At Dark Horse Windsor-Smith created an oversized series,Barry Windsor-Smith: Storyteller,that contained three ongoing features: \"The Paradoxman,\" \"Young GODS,\" and \"The Freebooters,\" that last a lightheard action series about a Conan-like character grown older and heavier and now running a tavern. The comic book was cancelled after nine issues; Fantagraphics Books has issued hardcover collections of Young GODS and The Freebooters, and The Paradoxman is expected to be released in 2006. Each of these hardcover volumes includes supplemental features, essays and previously unseen art.\nFantagraphics has also published Windsor-Smith'sAdastra in Africa, a hardcover starring a character from \"Young GODS\" in a story originally intended to beLifedeath IIIof Marvel'sThe Uncanny X-Menwith the character Storm. Fantagraphics has also publishedOpus, a series of hardcover art books featuring Windsor-Smith's work from throughout his career. These volumes also include his ongoing autobiographical story \"Time Rise,\" which features details of his extraordinary experiences with seemingly paranormal phenomena.\nIn January of 2006, BWS announced on the website Comic Book Galaxy that he is in negotiations to publish a graphic novel at Marvel Comics about the character The Thing.\nBarry Windsor-Smith has been recognized for his work with several awards and nominations.  He was nominated for the Shazam Award for Superior Achievement by an Individual in 1974. He also received nominations for the Comics' Buyer's Guide Favorite Colorist Award in 1997 and 1998.\n\n\n\n"

They were joined by other gods into forming theOlympians. Nyx became an outcast within her people, harboring a disdain for the Olympians' pageantries. When Nyx noticed the other gods had children which made them happy, she tried to emulate them. Three days after dreaming of the darkness and its stillness, Nyx gave birth toHypnos, the God of Sleep.\nWith the evolution of mankind, the night and the dark became correlative to the unknowns humanity feared. Mortal storytellers used their words to dispel these terrors and find comfort in heroes of myth, shaping Zeus and his children into these ever-growing heroes, causing Nyx to become their opposite. With each legion of followers the Olympians gained, both Nyx's rage and the Olympian's contempt for her grew stronger. Following another dream with her mind filled with thoughts of betrayal, Nyx gave birth to the twinsApateandDolos, the Gods of Deceit and Trickery, respectively. Nyx came to be known to other pantheons, such as theAsgardians, and wanting to be on her good side, All-FatherOdingifted her a mystical horse.[1]\nNyx and her children imprisoned\nConflict between Nyx and her children and the Olympians became inevitable. When a war broke out, Nyx and her children were defeated by the rest of the Olympians. Zeus shattered Nyx's soul into threeNight Shardsto depower her, and then cast her out along with her children into a prison of darkness, ensuring their confinement with a spell that sealed their fate for as long as theSunshone upon theEarth. Out of her hatred, Nyx manifested her fourth and most powerful child,Oizys, the Goddess of Misery.\nNyx and her children remained chained to their prison of darkness until the Modern Age. During a conflict between twoElders of the Universe, theGrandmasterand theChallenger, the Earth was briefly removed from its orbit around the Sun. With the spell of imprisonment broken, Nyx rallied her children against the Olympians. Believing the gods, the mortals and the universe itself to have all been spoiled after an eternity of mistreatment, Nyx set out to recreate the universe to her image, returning everything to a state of empty and pure darkness.[9]Nyx's return was heralded by the sudden blackout of every source of light in the universe, including the stars themselves.[3]When Nyx and her children arrived onOlympus, they slaughtered all the gods present in the scene, including Zeus, whose mind Nyx probed for the whereabouts of the Night Shards.[10]\nNyx's return to the universe was sensed byVoyager, the daughter of the Grandmaster, who then observed the Olympian massacre. Realizing that her father's scheme had facilitated the freedom of the Queen of Night, she assembled a group ofAvengersto stop Nyx, includingHercules, the son of Zeus. When these heroes reached Olympus, they stumbled into the massacre of gods,[3]and Nyx returned to confront the heroes with Oizys while the rest of her children went to retrieve the Night Shards. The heroes' efforts to fight Nyx and Oizys were futile, and the Queen of Night enchanted theScarlet Witch's eyes to see through them as her own in the process. After sensing the location of Nyx's children, Voyager split the Avengers and teleported them to the two locations,Omnipotence CityandNightmare's Realm, inadvertently leaving herself to Nyx's clutches.[10]\nNyx claiming a Night Shard\nWhile Apate and Dolos were fighting the Avengers at Omnipotence City, Nyx appeared and claimed the first shard, the Night That Was fromLord Librarian.[9]Before Nyx could deduce how to access the shard's power once more, the heroes caused a diversion that resulted in Voyager teleporting the Scarlet Witch away with the shard to theHyborian Age. When Nyx telepathically checked up on Hypnos's progress at Nightmare's Realm, she witnessed her son's death at the hands of theHulk, who took the Night Shard there, The Night That May Yet Be, for himself. In anger, Nyx lashed out against Hercules and theVision,[2]accidentally killing Apate and Dolos instead sinceSpectrumhad used her powers to turn herself into a holographic shell that disguised Vision and Hercules as the twins and vice versa.[11]\nIn the Hyborian Age, the Scarlet Witch went on a journey with the local barbarianConanto retrieve the Night Shard, accidentally summoning Nyx when she touched the shard.[12]Spectrum lifted Hercules and Vision's disguises and the combined forces of the heroes tried to stop Nyx. With the shard in hand, the Queen of Night eventually realized she needed to destroy it to gain its power. Doing so empowered Nyx, bind her to the other fragments, and caused her to catch a glimpse of a mysterious house in a vision. Nyx teleported herself back to the present to find the final shard, leaving Oizys to deal with the Avengers,[11]though she would meet her end instead.\nIn the present, Nyx arrived on the living planetEuphoria, where the Hulk's group was searching the last shard. After forcing the Hulk to transform back into Bruce Banner, Nyx took the power of the Night Shard he had absorbed, once again causing her to catch a glimpse of the mysterious house.[13]The Avengers left in the Hyborian Age followed Nyx, but their confrontation against the Queen of Night was interrupted by the corporeal manifestation of Euphoria. Since the warring between the Avengers and Nyx threatened to disrupt her paradise, Euphoria attempted to deescalate the conflict, and she eventually allowed Nyx to strip The Night That Is off her body.\nNyx's defeat\nReturned to her godhood, Nyx was able to pinpoint the location of the mysterious house, theHouse of Ideas. Realizing the house was the dwelling space of the fundamental creative force of reality, Nyx teleported herself to it to claim it as a seat of power from which she could remake the universe. The Avengers managed to follow her, but only Vision was able to get inside.[14]Inside the blank void within the house, Vision combined his knowledge from the Avengers files within his database with the house's nature to summon an army of constructs of Earth's mightiest heroes. This manifestation of the light of the human spirit pushed back against Nyx, weakening her until Vision, engulfed by this light's fire, burned the Queen of Nights to cinders. With her final words, Nyx swore that this fire wouldn't be able to burn her away forever. Following Nyx's defeat, the universal blackout caused by her return stopped.[6]\nOlympian Deity Physiology:Nyx possesses the conventional superhuman attributes of an Olympian Deity, including superhuman reflexes, speed, strength, durability and immortality."

Duckworld resembles mankind's Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. He was the son of aRonaldandHenrietta, a working class Roman Catholic couple living in New Stork. He had two siblings,TheresaandOrville.[21]As a child, he discovered an amazing potential intellect; however, he was continuously bullied by other children as a result. He eventually decided to give up on his studies, wasting his potential.[22]Further details about Howard's past on Duckworld are still unknown. Indeed, there are conflicting accounts as to the circumstances surrounding his disappearance.\nHoward vanished from his home world when the power-hungry demon-lordThog the Nether-Spawnused his demonic powers to cause the interdimensional cosmic axis to shift. Howard was dislodged from his home dimension and dropped into the middle of theFloridaEverglades onEarth-616at the site of this world'sNexus of All Realities, a place from which travel to all other dimensions is said to be possible. In an effort to set the Cosmic Axis right and return home, the reluctant Howard joined withKorrek of Ktharta, who also came from another dimension, the young Earth-born sorceressJennifer Kale,Dakimh the Enchanter, and theMan-Thing, the guardian of the Nexus. The battle against Thog ended for Howard when he fell off the other-dimensional Stepping Stones of Oblivion.[23][24][25]\nHe landed back onEarth-616in the city ofCleveland,Ohio, where he first faced the menace ofGarko, the Man-Frog.[26][27]\nHoward the Duck wanted to establish a reputation in Cleveland. As such, he sought to earn a position on the Cleveland police force by catching this mysterious farm stalker. During the investigation, he foundBessie the Hellcow, who attacked him, but Howard kept her at bay with a cross. During the fight, he used a mallet and wooden stake to seemingly end the blood-sucking bovine's hellish existence once and for all. Despite his heroism, however, Howard was still denied a position on the Cleveland police force, much to his dismay.[28][29]\nIn Cleveland, Howard first met the young life modelBeverly Switzlerwho was a captive of the costumed criminal accountantPro-Rata. Howard and Beverly escaped and began living together.[30]\nAlthough Howard attempted to live as normal a life as possible, considering that he was a talking duck on a world of human beings, he continually ran afoul of various unusual menaces including theTurnip Man,[31]Count Macho,[5]theWinky-Man,[32]Emile \"The Goat\" Klout[33]and theGingerbread Man.[34]\nHoward came to public notoriety when he became a candidate for the United States Presidency on a very minor party ticket.[35]He was even the target of an assassination plot as someone hiredDoctor Angstand his group, theBand of the Bland, to kill him. Howard defeated his would-be assassins with the help of theDefendersand they were sent to prison.[36]As it turned out, the assassination was unnecessary as the general populace refused to believe that Howard was a real talking duck, thinking of him instead as a dwarf in a duck suit. As a result, the public dismissed his candidacy as a joke.[37]\nHe continued to battle villains such as theBellhop,[38]Le Beaver,[39]Kong Lomerate,[40]theKidney Lady,[41]theRev. Joon Moon Yucand the Yuccies,[42]andRoxxon.[43]\nHis most notable arch-nemesis wasDoctor Bong. Through cleverness, persistence, and just plain good (if not dumb) luck, Howard always managed to either defeat or escape from his adversaries.[44]\nHoward went up against a hate group calledS.O.O.F.I.(SaveOurOffspringFromIndecency) who were \"trying to restore order to the world\".[45]\nWhile relaxing in his apartment Howard was attacked by a salt shaker with arms and legs on a giant housefly, but they were unable to defeat him. Dakimh and the Man-Thing arrived to ask Howard for his help and he was reluctantly transported to the Castle in the Sky over the Land Between Night and Day, where they were reunited with Korrek and Jennifer Kale. Dakimh brought them there to battle the demonBzzk'joh.[46]Bzzk'jho attacked them and Jennifer was forced to use her power to bring NAAC-P30 and 2-2 2-2, two Druid Droids that helped Howard, Korrek, and the Man-Thing stop jho. When Howard still refused to help, Korrek threatened Howard. Howard conceded when he tried to use the gun that was given to him by Dakimh and it turned out only to shoot a comedic flag. Riding Dakimh's spaceship, theEpoch Weasel, into the universe to get to jho's kingdom, the Imperium Emporium, the group escaped one of their delivery truck weapons. However, their ship was damaged, forcing them to land at the Hollywok Cantina. There they tried to find transport, dealing with real Californians and being told to speak to Big Mac about getting transport. Korrek tried to do so politely; however, he violently attacked Mac when he refused them transport, causing the real Californians to attack them. Howard managed to dispel them using the Farce through his gun, incapacitating them all. Securing a new ship, the group managed to burst into Bzzk'joh's base, the Death Store, a giant spaceship themed after a box store. There they fought through jho's armies and freed Jennifer, escaping just as the Death Store was set to explode, destroying jho and all of his followers.[47]They returned Howard toEarth-616New York, but he experienced nothing but trouble when he tried to help out a few New Yorkers[48]\nAfter finally meeting up with the cruise ship that rescued Paul and Winda, now befriended by socialite Iris Raritan, he attended her party onLong Island, where he was abducted by theRingmasterand hisCircus of Crime. Paul was shot and left in a coma, and Winda, abandoned by Paul and Iris, was apparently assaulted by a hobo.[49]After defeating the Circus of Crime Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, went his own way, as he had at the beginning of the series.[50][51]Howard then returned to Cleveland.[52]\nIron Duck\nHe battled Doctor Bong and teamed up withClaude Starkowitz, a former Vietnam vet who believed that he was related toTony Stark, the personal armorer toIron Man, and the genius behind the creation ofIron Man's Armor. Claude created for Howard a suit of Iron Man-inspired armor with springs and a built-in flamethrower, plus a device which would, hopefully, neutralize Bong's powers. Lee and Howard returned to the hospital, where Bong appeared to challenge Howard just as they finished setting up.[4]He used his bell to freeze everyone; however, it did not effect Howard who was protected not only by his armor but by cotton balls stuffed in his ears. The two engaged in a battle across the hospital, where Howard, in spite of being greatly outmatched, was able to lure Dr. Bong to the device which negated his powers. However, the device malfunctioned and Bong managed to grab Howard. With only one compartment untried, Howard opened up the armor's hip unit to find a small hammer. Remembering what happened to Bong the last time that he hit the bell on his head, Howard took the hammer and hit Bong on the head with it. The resulting peel from the bell transported both Bong and Howard away and freed everyone from Bong's paralysis. Howard and Bong rematerialized in Bong's castle, where Bong used his bell to strip Howard of his armor and removed his cotton balls. However, before Bong could finish Howard off, Beverly stopped him, showing him cloned babies that she she made and threatened to send a letter to the media, outing him as a negligent parent. Conceding and taking the cloned children, Dr. Bong angrily teleported Howard and Beverly back to the hospital. There they were reunited with Lee and Winda, who had come out of her coma.[53]\nNow living in Cleveland again, Howard battled new weird adversaries.[54]\nWhen Howard was on his way home from the laundromat, he was attacked out of the blue byDracula. Realizing Howard was not human he fled. Howard now started to displayvampire-like tendencies. He changed into traditional vampire garb and tried to attack Winda. Mistaking his bloodthirst for lust, Bev kicked Howard out of the house. The sometime-vampire hunterHarold H. Haroldcame looking for Howard and explained that his affliction was purely a disillusion. After a few failed attacks due to not having any teeth, they found him and tried to snap him out of the disillusion. Dracula arrived and tried to turn Bev into a vampire, but Howard staked him with a piece of a picket fence. Seeking immortality and listening to the dying Dracula claiming that he could give it to him, Harold foolishly removed the stake, and Dracula turned him into a vampire. Three days later, Howard read of reports of Harold clawing his way out of his grave.[55]\nHoward and Beverly on Duckworld\nHoward and Beverly arrived onDuckworldonEarth-791021. On this world, Beverly was considered the freak of the pair. Howard was eventually realized to have been the \"Drake\" who had vanished a few years back. Initially fleeing from overzealous worshipers, Howard led Beverly back to his former home, the base of the WACkies (Witness to theAscensionCult), and they learned what theRev. Godfrey Ganderhad done. Howard spoke up to the crowd, denouncing Rev. Godfrey and revealing the message that he had intended for them. Though initially reluctant, theDuckworldiansagreed to start thinking for themselves, while Gander vowed vengeance for losing his franchise. Howard worked to win his people over to Beverly, appearing with her onThe Tonight Showwith Johnny Quackson. In a \"This is Your Life\" pastiche, Howard was reunited with his parents and his sister Theresa, now a nun, and his brother Orville, now a mortician. However, the next guest,Dr. Ludwig von Cluck, actually a paid agent of Gander, attempted to use his Surrogate Sniffer super-vacuum machine to expose Beverly as a robot. It instead exposed her by tearing off all of her clothes. The appearance of a naked human appalled the Duckworldians. Howard and Beverly fled alongside fellow guest Truman Capoultry. A former ally of Gander, Capoultry wished to follow Howard's word and helped them escape. To help them return to Earth, Capoultry brought them toDucktor Strange, Mallard of the Mystic Arts, who was a drunk and living in an alley. Before Strange could do anything, the Rev. Gander,Scrounge McDrake, and their allies showed up and attempted to gun down Howard, Bev, Capoultry, and Strange. Bev kicked a trash can into their attackers, after which they overpowered them one-by-one. Strange cast a spell sending them back toEarth-616, and while Gander saw this as a chance to revive the WACkies, Capoultry vowed to write a new book telling the true story of Howard, which would foil Gander's plans.[21]\nArriving back in Earth-616, at the Nexus of All Realities in Florida, they teamed up with the Man-Thing again to battleKong Lomerate.[56]Howard and Bev got jobs at a retirement home inMiamiwhere they ran afoul of the grand designs of the Grey Panther.[6]The pair wound up inNew Orleanswhere Bev was kidnapped by theBlack Talonas an intended sacrifice of a voodoo cult.[57][58]\nHoward, working as a taxicab driver, had driven a customer to New York all the way from Cleveland. This man, calling himselfStatus Quo, was a mild-mannered librarian when the constant advent of new fads drove him to madness. Wanting to destroy all fads, Status Quo began studying how the media and advertisers help encourage fads, and came to New York in order to speak to people and convert them to his anti-fad group. This eventually led to a giant demonstration in Central Park where surprisingly, Status Quo managed to gather a large crowd and earn himself a legion of followers. These followers were armed with gimmicked fads (rocket-powered skateboards, exploding Frisbees, etc.) and sent out to attack anyone who supported any kind of fad. The chaos brought the attention ofSpider-Manwho tried to quell the mob, and prevent them from spreading beyond Central Park, while Howard was chased after by some anti-fad goons who thought he was trying to perpetuate a fad himself. Spider-Man eventually teamed up with Howard and the two managed to expose Status Quo as a hypocritical terrorist in front of live news cameras, discrediting him and causing his followers to break up. Afterwards, Howard and Spidey split up, and Howard returned to his cab where he found a police officer waiting for him to write him up on a number of traffic violations.[59]\nHoward was inSan Franciscoon Christmas Eve where he was on theGolden Gate Bridge, depressed and contemplating suicide. He was stopped by anAngelcalledAndy. Andy decided to try and boost Howard's confidence and morale; he showed Howard how the lives of its friends would have unfolded if Howard had never come toEarth-616. He showed HowardEarth-83234. They visited his friendsPaul Same,Arthur Winslow, andBeverly Switzler. To Howard and Andy's horror, all of his friends’ lives would have been better off without him. Believing that he had failed and that his life was worse than Howard's because he believed that would never get his wings, Andy considered suicide himself, but Howard succeeded in stopping him from doing so. Howard offered to buy Andy a drink rather than having either of them kill themselves. This act ironically won Andy his wings because, after all, itwasa successful mission.[60]\nHoward broke up with Beverly at her request. After that, he was mistaken for \"Duck Drake, Private Eye\".[57]He then metCeci Ryderwhen hitchhiking and battled theGopher, afterwards ending up back in Cleveland.[61]\nHoward later won 10 million dollars from the American Garden and Family grand prize contest. However, the fun and the fame changed him, causing him to lose contact with Bev. Dr. Dwight Clive convinced him to use the rest of his money to create a mate for himself. Using cell samples, he createdAlexis the Duck, but unwittingly used a brain taken from the body of the spoiled wife of a personal injury attorney. Alexis turned out to be a bitter gold digger who left Howard. Broke, he returned home to Cleveland.[16]\nThe Whoatcher had heartburn and created a cosmic burp that accidentally zappedSpider-HamofEarth-8311and Howard into an alternate dimension. They emerged onEarth-905237in the castle ofDucktor Doom. Working together they battled Doom, but the Whoatcher took some antacids, neutralizing the effects of the cosmic burp. Howard and Spider-Ham were sent home before the burp happened and disrupted Doom's weapon, which was the perfect synthesis between science and magic and with which he had intended to conquer the world. Howard felt that he got off easy, but then Ducktor Doom materialized in the alley behind him.[62]\nMeeting the She-Hulk\nTheShe-Hulkaccidentally pulled Howard through a cosmic wormhole, along with physicistBrent Wilcox, and prevented other universes from crowding outEarth-616.[63]Howard met the Critic, traveled to the Baloneyverse, and battled Dr. Angst and the Band of the Bland again.[64]\nIn California,ChamberandSkinofGeneration Xhitchhiked down a highway. After several cars flew past them, one of the vehicles stopped to offer the two mutants a ride. The driver of the vehicle was none other than Howard the Duck.[65]Howard and the mutants stopped at a bar to get some drinks, and the bartender informed them that their establishment did not serve ducks. Violence ensued and Howard was forced to rely upon his martial arts training inQuak Futo avoid injury. Chamber unleashed his mutant powers and began questioning the bar patrons about someone named Tores. To everyone's surprise,Miguela Toreswas actually a sultry young woman with a green stripe tattooed across her right eye. She entered the bar and began asking questions. While Chamber and Howard dealt with Tores, Skin sneaked away from the bar. He disguised himself as an old man and went to the cemetery to visit his own grave. There, he met his mother and managed to console her without letting on that he was, in fact, her son.[66]Outside in the Bio-Sphere, Howard and his girlfriend Bev arrived.Franklin,Artie, andLeechwere thrilled at the notion of having a talking duck to pal around with. Howard had no real interest in hanging out with children, but the kids dragged him to their treehouse. Inside they foundTana Nile. Tana was a Rigellian who crash-landed on Earth a short while ago. Leech had been sneaking her food from the school, and no one but the children were even aware of her presence.[67]Howard tried to find a way to get the children to safety.Black Tom Cassidyraided the tree house and prepared to kill them. Howard drove Black Tom back by setting him on fire with the lit end of his cigar. As the treehouse erupted into flames, Howard, Artie, Franklin, Leech, and Tana Nile discovered the Man-Thing present on the estate. Recognizing that the Man-Thing is the gateway into the dimensional rift known as the Nexus of All Realities, Howard convinced the others to dive into the creature's slimy body in the hopes of escaping. Their plan appeared to work and they disappeared inside the Man-Thing’s body.[68]\nHoward and the Daydreamers\nHoward and theDaydreamerswent sailing through the inter-dimensional byways of the Nexus, floating on a broken chunk of Earth. No one could really understand what was happening to them and Howard began to have a panic attack. Tana kept his attitude in check and reminds him that their first responsibility was to look after the children. Artie fell asleep and projected a vision of his nightmare: a dark, menacing shadowy figure. Before long, the Daydreamers arrived in a surreal fantasy world known as Nevernever-Narnozbia. Their earthen sled landed atop a woman (who looked suspiciously a lot like theScarlet Witch) known as the Red Witch of the Southeast, squashing her flat. A bunch of rocky little stone Things ran out to greet the visitors, expressing their happiness that the witch was finally dead. Suddenly, a man in drag named Strange arrived and thanked them for saving Nevernever-Narnozbia from the threat of the witch. Franklin expressed his desire to return home and Strange used the Eyeliner of Agamotto to direct them towards the King of the realm. Meanwhile, Howard the Duck was separated from the group and came upon a magic lamp. Rubbing the lamp, he summoned agreen goblin-likegenie who granted him three wishes. Howard wished for a way out of this mess, and the genie provides him with a DeSoto. Driving along in the antique car, he eventually met back up with his friends only for them to become prisoners of the King. The King bore a strong resemblance toDoctor Doom– an old foe of theFantastic Four. The Daydreamers tried to escape, and a fight broke out in the King's throne room. The dark spectral figure from Artie's vision arrived and declared that he had come for Franklin Richards.[69]\nThe Dark Hunter attacked theDaydreamersproclaiming that he had come for Franklin Richards. The Daydreamers could not decide which was stranger: the evil villain standing before them,Doctor Strangein drag, or the fact that the Man-Thing could suddenly carry on a conversation.Leechtried to siphon away the Dark Hunter's powers, but to no avail.Franklinasked Strange if he could send them home. Strange could not send them back to Earth, but instead used his magic wand to send them to another realm altogether. The group arrived in a bizarre cartoon-liked reality, which appeared as if it were crafted from the mind of Dr. Seuss. Weird creatures were seen walking down the streets with distended lips and large tufts of hair on their heads. Like the characters from Dr. Seuss, everyone had a penchant for speaking in rhyme. The Daydreamers stopped at a local diner to collect their thoughts. The staff at the diner became irate with Howard, who absolutely refused to speak in rhyme. Franklin placated the offended food servers by ordering their meals in rhyme for them. It did little good, however, as the Cadence Police arrived to arrest the Daydreamers. Howard wanted to start a fight with them, butTanaconvinced him that allowing them to be taken to jail might actually serve their better interests. Suddenly,Artiebegan to distrust Franklin. He continued to have visions of the Dark Hunter and felt that Franklin was connected to the Hunter in an unhealthy fashion. Franklin lashed out at him, declaring that he should mind his own business. Later that night, the Dark Hunter came for them. Tana Nile ripped the bars off of their prison cell and they broke free. She tried to keep the Dark Hunter at bay, but was unable to penetrate his shadowy form. Howard tried to get the Man-Thing to transport them back home, but the Man-Thing explained to him that he cannot control the power of the Nexus. Regardless, the Daydreamers dove into his slimy body and accessed theNexus of All Realities. When they exited, they found themselves onDuckworld– the planet of Howard's birth. They looked around in shock and awe as they saw a large bronze statue of Howard the Duck in the town square. To all accounts, Howard appeared to be a hero of the people.[70]\nCrowds of people began swelling around the new arrivals, eager to welcome their hero home. In an effort to keep the excited mob at bay, Tana Nile picked up the Man-Thing and began swinging him about like a baseball bat. The Daydreamers ducked down an alleyway and stealthily made their way towards Howard's home. Howard did not know why he was being hailed as a great hero and frankly, he did not care. The Man-Thing began to lose his cohesion, and Tana had to help him along. They arrived at the house of Howard's parents, June and Ward. It was an idyllic two-story home with a perfectly manicured lawn and a white picket fence. June and Ward came out to greet the newcomers and they welcomed Howard with open arms. Following a quick repast, Howard decided that he had had enough of this. He knew that this was not his true family and that his home life was never this perfect. As he shook his head in denial, the imagery washed away and all of it was revealed to be an illusion. Meanwhile, the Man-Thing continued to fall apart. Tapping into the cosmic energies of theNexus of All Realitieshad proven too taxing for his physical form and he could no longer maintain his cohesion. Before long, the Dark Hunter arrived on Duckworld and continued his pursuit ofFranklin Richards. The Daydreamers left Howard's phony household and proceeded to a place known as the Richards Institute. Inside were two-dimensional cartoon versions of Franklin's parents,ReedandSusan Richards. The Dark Hunter tracked them down and they soon realized what the Hunter actually was – he was the living embodiment of Franklin Richard's repressed emotions. When the Daydreamers first interacted with the Nexus of All Realities, it reacted with Franklin's dormantmutantpowers, creating a conduit into a pocket dimension inside Franklin's subconscious mind. Franklin never came to terms with the fact that his parents were gone – victims of the villain known asOnslaught. In his grief, he fabricated an imaginary, illusory world where he could effectively hide from his pain. Now having confronted his own fears in the form of the Dark Hunter, Franklin was finally ready to let go of his parents. As Franklin's pocket reality ceased to exist, the Daydreamers exited the Nexus of All Realities. They were back onEarth-616in the FloridaEverglades, and the Man-Thing was back to his normal, inarticulate self.[71]\nWhile the Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian of Franklin, Howard went off on his own and was captured by theCult of Entropy.[72]Although he was last seen him in the swamp, he stated that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wanted him because he had part of the Nexus of All Realities, which had shattered duringHeroes Reborn, inside him, which he knew because it was making him nauseous. The Man-Thing entered his gullet, and Howard vomited him back out with the fragment, but the former was left desiccated and practically dead.[73]\nHe then encounteredNamor the Sub-Mariner, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explained that he would not be lugging his friend's body if that were the case. Howard set the Man-Thing down in the water, and he revived during the conversation with Namor. Once he saw that the Man-Thing was alive and well, he bid Namor farewell and told him that he was returning to Cleveland.[74]\nHe worked withSpider-Man (Ben Reilly)in a fight against the Circus of Crime, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting theSavage DragonandDestroyer Duck. The group left in the belief that they had brought the correct Howard with them.[75]\nJennifer Kale attempted to return Howard home many times, but he accused her and Doctor Strange of being responsible for bringing him toEarth-616. She accidentally teleportedDevil DinosaurandMoon Boyinto her New York apartment.[76]The disoriented dinosaur attempted to eat Howard, but spat him out when he was shot with theGhost Rider'sHellfire Shotgun. They then went on a rampage through the city before being subdued by theGhost Rider. Howard related to the pair, being trapped in a world he was never meant to be in, and wandered off.[77]\nHoward got a job as a department storeSanta Claus, which got him dragged to theNorth Pole, where the realSanta Claushad sold out toHydra.[78]\nHoward the Duck in mouse form\nBeverly obtained a job at a company that was owned by Doctor Bong who turned Howard into a mouse, but the process was unstable and he cycled through different forms before settling on the mouse form again.[79]Bong joined withKenneth Floggto gain theAmulet of Pazuzu, but Howard obtained it first, gained its power, and used it to slay Flogg's assistant,Ian Whippingham.[80]They next stayed at theBoarding House of Mystery, joining their fellow tenant,Splatter Gomorrah, in exposing talk show hostIprahas a marketing franchise.[81]However, she was possessed by the angel-demon hybridDeuteronomy. Howard used the cigar of the Saint of Therapists,Sigmund Freud, to banish Deuteronomy; however, he decided to take a puff of the cigar which disintegrated him and sent him toHell.[82]He was saved byGodHimself who, grateful for him dealing with Deuteronomy, shared with Howard the meaning of life before returning him to Earth back in his duck form.[83][84]\nHoward the Duck tried to sue the directorGeorge Lucasover a film, and was represented byGoodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway.[85][86]\nAs an interdimensional non-human being, Howard was compelled to register under theSuperhuman Registration Actalong with Beverly.[7]He attempted to do so during theCivil War[87]but learned that his socially disruptive life had created so many bureaucratic headaches that the U.S. government's policy was that Howard, the so-called infamous \"Duck Man of Cleveland\", did not exist. This lack of government oversight delighted Howard: \"For the rest of my life... no more parking tickets - or taxes - or jury duty. Heck, I couldn't even vote if I wanted to! This is even better than Christmas in Vegas! I no longer officially exist!\"[7][88]\nAfter he defeatedM.O.D.O.T.'s scheme to control the public through the mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, had him registered with the government. including all relevant responsibilities and the President made him a citizen with a full presidential pardon.[89]\nAt some point, Howard was made part of theOhio Initiative, but the team was eventually shut down by the Feds for unrevealed reasons.[10]He was subsequently made an agent ofA.R.M.O.R., and was hired byMorbius the Living Vampireon a private mission to travel through the multiverses of different types of zombies and collect a sample of each one of them. Before he could go, he was to search forMachine Manand recruit him. One week after being enrolled, Howard found Machine Man drunk and depressed, for his girlfriendJocastawent back to her former husbandUltron. Howard was able to convince Machine Man to join him on their mission.[90]\nThe Fearsome Four\nDuring theFear Itselfevent, Howard formed a team called theFearsome Fourwith theShe-Hulk,Frankenstein's Monster, andNighthawkto stop theMan-Thing, who found himself driven to an uncontrollable rage caused by the immense levels of fear generated by theSerpent'shammer-wieldersacross the world.[91]Facing various alternate universe heroes and thePsycho-Man, brought to Earth by the Man-Thing's connection to theNexus of All Realities,[92]the Four were eventually able to confront their own fears and calm the Man-Thing, bringing an end to his rampage and saving the world, before going their separate ways.[93]\nCynical Duck and Swizzle\nHoward and Bev were both brainwashed and forced to work forS.O.O.F.I.as Cynical Duck and Swizzle. They promoted S.O.O.F.I. at a public speech held for them byJ. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man interrupted a S.O.O.F.I. indoctrination at theNew York Public Library, and Bev and the other S.O.O.F.I.s saw Spidey as a semi-demonic figure and attacked him. Spidey escaped with Howard and broke his brainwashing because Bev was being threatened. Howard quickly explained S.O.O.F.I.'s goals to Spider-Man. As Spider-Man publicly announced his long-standing support for S.O.O.F.I., Howard confronted Bev as she stood by theSupreme S.O.O.F.I.. Howard broke through to Bev, reminding her of their past. The leader ordered the S.O.O.F.I.s to throw the pair into the special Blanditron atGuantanamo Bay, and Bev kept them at bay with her whip. Spidey attacked them and unmasked the Supreme S.O.O.F.I., while the others escaped though their teleporter. Howard believed S.O.O.F.I. would lay low for a while after such a defeat, and also hoped their Florida Everglades base might lead them to meet up with the Man-Thing.[12]\nThe Ducky Dozen\nBecause of his experience with zombie-infested worlds and his leadership of Machine Man, Howard was chosen as the leader of, as he dubbed them, theDucky Dozen.[94]The team was comprised of himself, several Golden Age heroes,Dum Dum Dugan, andBattlestar, who was also a veteran of a zombie incident. Upon enteringEarth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fought hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffered grave losses as most of the members were either killed or zombified in battle.[95]After successfully accomplishing their mission Howard, Dugan, Taxi Taylor, and Battlestar were the only members left that had survived and returned toEarth-616along with theRiveter, the only survivor of Earth-12591's resistance team theSuffragists.[96][97]\nHoward teamed up with his friendDoopto battle Robo-Barbarians in Dimension ZZZ. They beat the horde back with nothing but a broken sword, a rubber chicken with nails in it, and a gun that shot bees.[98]\nAfter the death ofUatu the Watcherand the activation of the secrets buried in his eye, Howard discovered that he had the potential to be the most intelligent being in Duckworld. After evading a squirrel while driving, he was thrown flying and used his intellect to calculate his way to land safely in a dumpster.[22]\nHoward returned to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as theShe-Hulkin Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by theBlack Cat. With the help ofTara Tam, a new ally, Howard managed to recover the necklace, but on his way to give it back to Richards he found himself kidnapped by theCollector,[99]allied with theGuardians of the Galaxyto escape the villain's collection,[100]and confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him.\nDuring his third attempt at recovering the necklace, from the Ringmaster this time, Howard was approached by Richards, who revealed himself to be theSkrullTalos the Untamed, and explained the true nature of the stone in the necklace: it was one of the several Abundant Gems.[101]Once Talos fled the scene, Howard and Tara sought the help ofDoctor Strangeto learn more about these Abundant Gems. Joined by theHuman Torch, the heroes failed to beat Talos in the race for the final gem, and the villain made himself more powerful with theAbundant Glove.[102]In the middle of the battle, during which Tara publicly revealed his shapeshifting abilities to help fight the energy constructs that were created by Talos, Howard managed to snatch the Abundant Glove from the alien villain and defeat him.[103]\nHoward eventually set out to return to his home dimension, and traveled toFloridato find theNexus of All Realitiesin order to reach this goal. However, his attempt to use theCompassion Gemof theAbundant Gloveto help him find his way home merged him with the Nexus.[104]The fusion turned Howard into a Living Nexus which could also be used to teleport to different destinations willingly instead of randomly, as the Nexus normally acted. Howard's new-found powers caught the attention of numerous people who desired to use Howard for their own ends, including gender-bent clones of Howard andRocket RaccoonnamedLindaandShocket Raccoon, who wanted to rescue everyone trapped inCollectonand escape to another universe.\nHoward agreed to help Linda and Shocket, and on their way to Collecton, they were pursued by bothSkrullsand theStranger.[105]Howard was seemingly rescued from the Stranger's clutches byScout, a cosmic-powered girl who wanted to give Howard as a gift toGalactusand prove herself worthy of being his new Herald. With the help of theSilver Surferand theGuardians of the Galaxy, Howard's allies rescued him.[106]Using a portion of thePower Cosmicgranted to him by the Silver Surfer, Howard brought his allies to Collecton and helped both defeat the Collector and free its prisoners, who used Howard's powers as the Living Nexus to return to their homes. When Howard was separated from the Nexus and used it to return home, he was accidentally sent to the doorstep of Bev's new house.[8]Following a bittersweet and brief reunion, Howard returned to New York.[107]\nWhile investigating a case for actressLea Thompson, Howard discovered that the nefariousMojoof theMojoversehad turned him into the unwitting protagonist of his own reality show. However, in order to ensure Howard's life remained interesting for the ratings, he had hired the services ofChippandJho, two members of the race ofreality warpersknown as theSparkitects, who had subtly influenced Howard's life and been responsible for most of his recent misadventures.[108]\nThe two Sparkitects became directly involved with Howard's confrontation against Mojo after realizing that the villain could find out that Howard discovering the reality show was an attempt by them to shut down Mojo's program and cut off all ties with him. When Howard confronted Chipp, the Sparkitect stabbed and killed him.[19]However, Jho's attempt to redeem his wrongs brought Howard back to life, after manipulatingDoctor Strangeinto returning his soul to his body.\nDuckworldian Physiology:Howard's body, like those of his entire race, has similar characteristics to those of both common Earth ducks and common Earth human beings. He has hands and arms instead of wings, is covered with feathers and is unable to fly. Howard is similar to a human athlete who has trained his body to the fullest. Howard can stay alive in the space vacuum without suffering any harmful effects, even without using any type of suit that protects him from the environment or provides him with oxygen.[109][106]\nEnhanced Duckworldian Speed:After his training Howard has improved his speed, moving faster than the human eye can see.[5]\nSuper Reflexes and Precision:Howard's reflexes have been honed to the point of utmost precision, allowing him to allegedly move faster than the eye can see. He is also capable of catching a knife being thrown at him.[5]\nMystical Training:TheSorcerer SupremeDoctor Strangehas also briefly tutored Howard in the mystic ways, indicating even those of Duckworld possess magical potential.[109][110][111][112][113]Under his mental guidance, Howard was capable of conjuring theVapors of Valtorr, theShield of the Seraphim, use transformation enchantments and even utilize anotherEye of AgamottoandCloak of Levitationalong with his own garb forHoward the Duck, which the duck was able to command, despite his lack ofSorcerer Supremetitle, though ultimately declining to study as Strange's apprentice. Dr. Strange has claimed that Howard has incredible potential, making him one of the most powerful sorcerers.[36]\nLiving Nexus:Howard was temporarily merged with theNexus of All Realities, allowing him to act as a gateway to the Multiverse. When somebody touches him, he can choose where they will travel or they can make their own choice. He can also create an entirely new universe with his own specifications and can be tracked by cosmic beings and ships acting like an \"cosmic ark.\"[105]\nMartial Arts:Howard is a master in the little-known martial art calledQuak Fu, which he learned at the hands ofMaster C'haaj,[5]and hence is a surprisingly formidable opponent in hand-to-hand combat, which allows him to defeat opponents that are more powerful than himself.[109]\nWillpower:As part of his Quak Fu training, Howard reached a new state of consciousness and developed an immense willpower. Howard can use his will to break down material barriers with easy sum, apparently increasing his strength.[5]\nSuper-Fast Learning:During his martial arts training, Howard dominated the irrelevance of chronological time, giving him the ability to master a life of studies and training in just three hours and seventeen minutes.[5]"

Also known as the Talismans of Damballah, these items are mystically endowed with the power of their namesake,Damballah– one of the most powerfulLoaof the Voodoo religion. Each talisman is etched with the symbol of the serpent. Singularly, each amulet is capable of granting the user control over the dead, but the power only fully manifests when both amulets are used in concert.\nSeveral years ago, an unscrupulous gardener namedGypsforced a Voodoo mambo,Layla, to use her knowledge of the dark arts to resurrect the body of recently murdered coffee magnate,Simon Garth. Garth rose from his grave as an unfetteredZombie, and attacked the nearby cultists. One of them managed to slip one of the Amulets of Damballah over the creature's neck, and it instantly froze. They gave the second amulet to Gyps, and told him that so long as he possessed the amulet, he would maintain control of the Zombie.\nGyps' ownership of the amulet was brief however. He ordered Simon Garth's zombie to murder his own daughter,Donna Garth, but a brief flicker of recognition imbued the zombie with enough free will to resist the command. Further, he turned against Gyps, strangling him until he died. The zombie retreated into the swamps ofNew Orleanswhile still wearing one half of the twin talismans.\nThe second talisman remained with Gyps' corpse until it resurfaced at the 7th precinct of theNew Orleans police department.Detective Sam Jaggerrecovered the item and gave it to Donna Garth. Donna had no clue as to the amulet's true significance, but there was something about it that reminded her of her father. Donna's love for her father caused the zombie to rise from his grave once again.[1]\nA short time later, a man namedGene Griggsmugged Donna and stole the amulet. The zombie instinctively homed in on the talisman's location and confronted Griggs. Griggs attempted to destroy the zombie, only to meet a tragic end. During the scuffle, the amulet fell from Griggs' grasp and landed on the sidewalk.\nA homeless, self-proclaimed \"hater-of-lawyers\" named Phil Bliss found the amulet and showed it to a waitress named Jeanette. Jeanette told him that the artifact was of Voodoo origin and was used to control the dead. Bliss unwittingly tapped into its power and summoned the zombie. The zombie walked along the ocean floor from Haiti to New Orleans in answer to the call. Bliss had the zombie attack a local courthouse, ordering him to murder every lawyer he could find.\nYears later, one of the amulets came into the possession of the mystic,Calypso. During an earlier debacle, Calypso was savagely murdered by her former servant,the Lizard. While her physical body remained in a state of perfect preservation, her soul remained unfettered, leaping from one body to another. She bound her soul to the Talisman of Damballah and sought to use it to rejoin her spirit with her body. While inhabiting the body of an elderly woman, she boarded a Caribbean cruise ship where she metGlory Grant. She gave Grant the talisman and then left the old woman's body, infusing her spirit with the talisman. Through this, she was able to control Grant's actions.\nAfter Glory returned to New York, the spirit of Calypso forced her to exhume her remains. The Zombie meanwhile, followed the amulet's trail to New York and intercepted Glory/Calypso at Cypress Hills Cemetery. The zombie likely would have killed her, but for the timely intervention ofSpider-Man. While the two fought, Calypso completed the spell, and her spirit returned to her body. Spider-Man recovered the talisman and returned it to the Zombie.\nA short time later, a wealthy student of the arcane named Kelsey Pierce acquired one of the amulets and offered it to the vampireLilith Drakein the hope that she would reciprocate by turning him into a vampire. Lilith accepted the gift, but killed Pierce rather than turning him into a vampire. With the amulet, she took control of Simon Garth, and used him as her personal servant, forcing him to attack innocents and drag them back to her lair.\nDuring this time, Donna Garth hired vampire private investigatorHannibal Kingto find the amulets and bring her father back to New Orleans. King's investigation led him to New York where he found himself teaming-up with Spider-Man in order to take down Lilith. The two were unsuccessful in defeating her, but King did manage to purloin the amulet, and he brought both the talisman and the Zombie back to New Orleans."

Prof. Green found the artifact but did not give it to the general but kept it for himself wearing it and transforming himself into the superhuman Achilles.[1]\nThe Amulet of Achilles was a nuanced magical item of divine origin that granted anyone who wore it a number of superhuman traits that came at a steep price. Lewis Green described the item as a vessel for a finite pool of energy that could be refilled indefinitely through the lifespan of others, a contingency put in place by the gods to prevent misuse.\nDivine Transformation:The wearer could empower themselves with the amulet's font of life-force at will. Furthermore, the more victims the wearer made, the stronger he became by absorbing the vital energy of his victims. While in this empowered state the wearer would fill out their frame and grow much sharper and chiseled facial features, becoming a more Hellenistic version of themselves. Prof. Green noted that this sensation was akin to\"letting out his inner Achilles\"indicating that the change was not only physical but psychological as well. In fact, the usually meek Lewis Green became much bolder under the amulet's influence to the point of arrogance and perhaps even apathy to the value of human lives. At least in the case of criminals.\nThe wearer was made immediately aware of the amulet's function and drawbacks upon activating it for the first time.[3]The breadth of powers that were accessible by the wearer were as follows:\nCurse of the Gods:To prevent mortals from abusing the amulet's power against them, the Olympians placed a condition on its use. For each time it was activated or when it was worn for more than a day, its wearer would lose a year of their life. Each life taken while wearing the amulet would then restore a year.[3]"

Lin Sun discarded the amulets, pitching them into an alleyway, where they were eventually discovered byHector Ayala, who channeled the power of all three amulets to become the White Tiger.[8]\nAfter Ayala's retirement,[9]he returned the Amulets to the original Sons of the Tiger, who were convinced of the talismans' true mystic properties when they were drawn into another dimension. Seeking that power for himself,Master Khan, the self-proclaimed God of K'un-Lun, had hisNinja henchmansteal the Amulets for him. Combining the Amulets with the original Jade Tiger statue, they grew into the shape of a lifelike full-grown tiger and opened a portal to K'un-Lun, which Khan rode the Tiger through, withPower Man,Iron Fist, and the original Sons of the Tiger in close pursuit.[6]\nSomehow, Hector Ayala reclaimed the original amulets and became the White Tiger again for one night. While interrupting a burglary, the thieves fled and a misunderstanding with the police led to Hector being arrested for the murder of the store owner. He was found guilty at trial and fled the courthouse before being shot to death on the front steps of the courthouse.[10]\nThe Jade Tiger Amulets were eventually handed down to Ayala's niece,Angela Del Toro, who became the new White Tiger.[11]However, she was corrupted by theHandand fell from grace in the hero community.[12]Hector's youngest sister,Ava Ayala, adopted the role of White Tiger after her.[13]\nWhenJeremy Briggssought to depower the world with hisClean Slatenanotechnology, he disabled the students ofAvengers Academyby stealing their magical artifacts, giving the Amulets of Power toCoat of Arms. However, thanks to her relationship with theTiger God, Ayala was able to bring their power back to her.[14]\nDivine Empowerment: Wearers of the amulet are imbued with the power of the ancientTiger God, imbuing them with master-level knowledge and experience of the martial arts,[citation needed]among other powers. When worn separately, by joining hands and reciting the incantation, \"When three are called and stand as one, as one they'll fight, their will be done... For each is born anew, The Tiger's Son\", Abe Brown, Bob Diamond, and Lin Sun were able to mystically channel their martial arts prowess through one another, increasing each other's strength and prowess.[7]Hector Ayalaand subsequentWhiteTigersused all three amulets in unison, greatly increasing the amount of power wielded by a single host.[8]\nDivine Possession: During extraneous circumstances, the wearer of the Amulets can have their body taken over entirely by the Tiger God, increasing their ferocity in battle.[4]\nLife Imitation: When combined with the body of the original enchanted statue, the Amulets can grow and change to become part of a lifelike copy of the Tiger God itself.[6]\nAnyone who uses the Amulets for an extended period of time can find themselves physically addicted to its power.[10]"

It has been worn down the millennia by the many different mages who have been theTalismanfor their time. The first Talisman wasNahita, from theTribe of the Moon.[1]In one previous time, it was used to cage the race known as theSka'rin another dimension.[2]\nThe current Talisman,Elizabeth Twoyoungmen, gained it by reaching into her father,Shaman's,pouchand withdrawing it. The moment she put it on, she was transformed.[3]\nHowever, the circlet came with a price: it cannot be removed without excruciating pain. Elizabeth did eventually have the tiara removed byPestilenceand her father placed it on his brow, gaining its powers.[4]\nElizabeth eventually regained the circlet to become Talisman once again.Wanda Langkowskitook the talisman whileMichael Twoyoungmenwas transferring it back to his daughter. Wanda was under the mental influence of theDreamqueenwho desired to add its power to her own. Before Wanda could deliver the Coronet of Enchantment to the Dreamqueen,Snowbirdaltered Wanda's physical form, turning him back into Walter. This broke the Dreamqueen's connection to her (now him) and Walter returned the circlet to Elizabeth.[5]\nThe Talisman of Power enhances the Talisman's natural power to manipulate magical fields and energy as well as allowing the wearer to control various natural spirits. If worn by someone other than the Talisman, the circlet will allow them (if they are at least partly magical in nature) to manipulate magical fields and spirits.[3][7]"

Nel 950 d.C., attaccò gliAsgardianicercando di impossessarsi del loro potere, ma fu sconfitto daThor. Privato della maggior parte del suo potere, andò sulla Terra.[13]\nAlla fine, Marduk stipulò un'alleanza con un semidio del suo stesso pantheon,Aqhat, e il dio del male degliAkua,Whiro(fingendosi la dea della Terra AkuaPapahanau-Moku); questo gruppo, noto comeSempiterni, iniziò ad accumulare energia vitale rubata dalPozzo della Genesiin un piano per riportare Marduk al suo antico potere.

That enraged, Tiamat and her sonKingu, who led Tiamat's army of monster progeny[17](includinghorned serpents,snake-dragons,demonic lions,lion-men,scorpion-men, andbull-men),[18]led siege toDilmun, plunging the Annunaki into acivil war.[2]\nDagon's throne was briefly usurped by Ba'al and Ea, who view their brother as ineffective, but they were driven off by Dagon's sonUllikummis.[15]\nAs Anu's sons were unable to defeat the enemy, his grandsonMardukproposed to led the armies of the Annunaki in exchange for becoming the Annunaki supreme leader, and slew Tiamat[19]using heavenly weapons (mace, trident and axe) forged byNingal.[10]Marduk consequently replaced Anu.[2]\nAlthough being supplanted as ruler of the gods, Anu retained a position of authority.[1]\nCirca 18,500, Anu was worshiped, as a minor cult, at least in theValusiansea-port ofOstium.[20]\nCirca 10,000 BC, Anu was worshiped in many places, includingCorinthia, and dispatched theBull of Anuon behalf of his priests.[3]\nIn about 500 AD, when monotheistic religions began to replace the Anunnaki worship, Anu produced the edict that they were to return to cut their ties with Earth and return to Dilmun (where they weren't dependent on mortal worshipers). The edict was unpopular among many Annunaki who feared losing their influence, and who were tricked byMarduk Kuriosand transformed intodemons.[2]\nAnu at the Council of Godheads\nAround 1000 AD, he attended theCouncil of Godheadsto discuss the threat of theCelestials.[21]\nAnu possesses the conventional physical attributes of the Mesopotamian gods. Like all of the Mesopotamian gods, he is immortal. He has not aged since reaching adulthood and cannot die by any known conventional means. He is immune to all known earthly diseases and is invulnerable to conventional injury. If wounded, his godly life force would enable him to recover with superhuman speed. It would take an injury of such magnitude that it dispersed a major portion of his bodily molecules to cause him a physical death. Even then, it might be possible for Zeus, Odin, Ea or a number of gods of equal power working together to revive him. Anu does have some superhuman strength and his own godly metabolism gives him far greater than human endurance in all physical activities.[citation needed]"

Eons ago, during theAnnunaki Civil War, Marduk successfully ledAnu's forces against the armies ofTiamat, and in return was crowned ruler of theAnnunaki.[1]\nHis priests gained theBook of the Vishantiand kept it guarded by a large griffin, but the beast was defeated by the sorcererYao(sometimes known as the Ancient One), who gained possession of the Book, twice due to time-travel paradoxes.[3]\nFor unknown reasons Marduk began to decline in power. In 950 AD, he attacked theAsgardiansseeking to take their power for his own, but was defeated byThor. Stripped of most of his power, he went to Earth.[4]\nEventually, Marduk entered into an alliance with a demigod from his own pantheon,Aqhat, and theAkuagod of evilWhiro(posing as the Akua Earth goddessPapahanau-Moku); this group, known asthe Everlasting, began accumulating stolen life energy into theGenesis Wellin a plan to restore Marduk to his former power. Marduk later began various schemes, posing as curator Zoltan Nestor. He met and manipulatedDestroyer (Roger Aubrey)to keep theV-Battalionfrom uncovering his schemes.\nMarduk of the Annunaki\nAnnunaki Physiology:Before being stripped of his powers Marduk possessed the average abilities of an Annunaki god.[6]"

Along with his girlfriendPaulette Brazee, Watkins took them on many successful missions over occupied Europe and even in Germany. In 1943, Brazee infiltrated the inner circle of Nazi scientist known asBaron Heinrich Zemo, taking the codename She-Wolf and finally helped Citizen V, Captain America and Bucky to destroy the weapon Particle X-Zemo.[citation needed]\nHeinrich vowed to get his revenge and sent an undercover operative to infiltrate the V-Battalion. Heinrich killed Citizen V in Poznan, Poland by strangling him to death. Soon after the Nazis murdered most of the original members of the V-Battalion.[citation needed]\nLater the survivors of the V-Battalion along with other WW2 superheroes (Destroyer,Silver ScorpionandIron Crossamong others) and new members such asDallas Riordan's paternal grandfather (an American soldier who stayed in Europe after the war) reconstituted the V-Battalion. The primary mission of this new V-Battalion was to hunt down Nazi war criminals. They operated out of a base in Symkaria.[citation needed]\nThe V-Battalion's primary field agent usually uses the codename Citizen V after the original Citizen V. The original Citizen V was killed by Heinrich Zemo. The second Citizen V wasPaulette BrazeeWatkins girlfriend who later gave birth to his son John Watkins Jr and married a soldier. PresumablyJJ Watkins (John Watkins Jr.)was the third Citizen V. Sometime later JJ's sonJohn Watkins IIIwas Citizen V and was somehow rendered comatose for five years.[citation needed]\nYears later when Heinrich Zemo's son Helmut Zemo led the Masters of Evil he decided the group would pose as heroes to take the place of the missing Avengers and Fantastic Four who disappeared after a battle with Onslaught. The Masters of Evil became the Thunderbolts and Helmut took the name Citizen V (knowing full well his father murdered him) and falsely claimed to be the grandson of the original Citizen V. At this time Helmut did not know the V-Battalion had been reconstituted nor did he know the original Citizen V had an actual grandson.[citation needed]\nIn time Helmut's scam unraveled and he was a fugitive on the run after he nearly conquered the world. One of the people affected by the scam was the Thunderbolts liaison to the New York City's Mayor's office Dallas Riordan who lost her job. The V-Battalion had been interested in approaching Dallas as the next Citizen V even before the Thunderbolts scam and had placed an operative in the mayor's office named Miles Warbeck (Miles Warton) to keep tabs on her and the Thunderbolts. When Helmut Zemo's Citizen V first arrived on the scene the V-Battalion were suspicious of his claims to be the original's grandson but did not move against him. After Helmut's scam fell apart Roger Aubrey the Destroyer sought out Dallas Riordan and offered her a place in the V-Battalion as their operative Citizen V. Dallas's grandfather had abandoned his family in America and given his life early on in the adventures of the reconstituted V-Battalion. Dallas's father James Riordan was a police captain who had trained his daughter to be a fighter. He never joined the V-Battalion and did not want his daughter to join either but he knew the possibility existed that she would be approached to join the group so he made sure she was prepared just in case.[citation needed]\nFor months Dallas acted as Citizen V. First she worked to track down the Thunderbolts because she was furious at being fired and felt she was used by Atlas. She tracked down Helmut Zemo in Mexico and blew up his castle. Later she offered Hawkeye the chance to leave the Thunderbolts or risk her wrath. Hawkeye refused her offer and later Citizen V was knocked unconscious by a member of the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil who were plotting to hold the world for ransom with weather machines. When the Thunderbolts defeated the Masters of Evil, Justine Hammer the Crimson Cowl framed Dallas Riordan as the Crimson Cowl and she was sent to prison. Atlas later posed as a journalist to get into prison to see Dallas but she was broken out of jail by V-Battalion operatives. Out of jail Dallas went back to being Citizen V in the hopes of tracking down the Crimson Cowl but instead ended up embroiled in a conflict with the Secret Empire an organization at that time (unknown to Dallas or the Thunderbolts) being funded by Helmut Zemo.[citation needed]\nDallas at first blinded by her need for revenge against Zemo, The Thunderbolts and the Crimson Cowl refused to see how corrupt the V-Battalion's leaders the Penance Council had become. Dallas finally chose to leave the organization when she was given orders to assassinate Henry Peter Gyrich a politician who ran the Commission on Superhuman Affairs. (The V-Battalion wanted this done presumably because Gyrich at this time had been corrupted by nanites by Hydra and had used Nomad as Scourge to assassinate several people including Helmut Zemo). Dallas left to find the Thunderbolts but was abducted by the Crimson Cowl. The battle with the Cowl left Dallas Riordan crippled for many many months.[citation needed]\nAlthough Scourge had beheaded Helmut Zemo neither knew that Helmut's ally Techno had placed a bio-modem in Helmut's body and that when he died Helmut's mind was sent into the comatose body of John Watkins III. For weeks Helmut pretended to be John Watkins III as Citizen V and with the V-Battalion's help gathered together the Redeemers. The Redeemers and the Thunderbolts defeated Gyrich and Helmut soon learned his father's compatriot Baron Strucker was the mastermind behind the whole affair.[citation needed]\nWhile in John Watkins III's body Helmut confronted Baron Strucker and killed his daughter Andrea. During a battle with Graviton many members of the Redeemers were killed and Citizen V gathered the original Thunderbolts together to defeat Graviton. Graviton was revealed to be the pawns of aliens who were using him to conquer earth. The Thunderbolts realized that some of them would have to collapse a gravity well. Many of the Thunderbolts were sent to Counter Earth while Songbird stayed behind. The V-Battalion had tried teleporting Citizen V out during this melee and the result was that Helmut Zemo's mind ended up inside Fixer's tech pac and John Watkins III was in control of his own body again.[citation needed]\nJohn Watkins would later fight the god Marduk. He also was involved in an adventure with Deadpool and Flag Smasher in Rumekistan.[citation needed]\nThere was once a mention there were 7 people who have taken the name Citizen V. The identities of six are known (John Watkins Sr, John Watkins Jr, John Watkins III, Paulette Brazee, Helmut Zemo and Dallas Riordan).[citation needed]\nThe V-Battalion is lead by the Penance Council. Roger Aubrey was the de facto leader of the council and while certainly not an evil man over the years some of his decisions were morally compromised, with him often nudging the group towards decisions wherein they chose expediency and protecting their secrecy over morality.[citation needed]\nEventually Roger Aubrey decided to quit the V-Battalion and left the group in the hands of the original Human Torch Jim Hammond.[citation needed]\nTwo other important members of the Penance Council were Elizabeth Barstow and Helmut Grueler. Elizabeth Barstow had been the golden age hero the Silver Scorpion but in modern times her keen mind was addled by Alzheimer's Disease. Helmut Grueler was 102 before he died and had been a German who did not believe in Nazi ideology during WW2 but fought for the Fatherland nevertheless.[citation needed]\n"

As a youth, he accompanied his father on his diplomatic missions to various countries, never living in the same place for more than a year. Although he learned to speak several foreign languages fluently, the constant readjustment to new environments hampered his social growth. Consequently, he felt like an outcast and became too introverted to form many friendships.\nWhile living inTokyo, Morgenthau began to study martial arts, and at fifteen earned his black belt in karate. At the age of nineteen, he followed his father, who had become a delegate to theUnited Nations, toAmericaand enrolled inColumbia University. He intended to major in political science and follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a diplomat. However, when his father was trampled to death in a riot outside theLatverianembassy, the young man's goals changed. He felt that his father had pursued the goal of world peace and unity far too passively. He would spread the message using the only language he felt the world would respond to, the language of violence.\nEmploying his vast inheritance to finance his mission, Morgenthau contracted certain unrevealed parties to supply him with an arsenal of experimental weaponry. He then fashioned himself the costumed identity of the Flag-Smasher and returned to New York to begin a campaign of terrorist assaults on symbols of nations such as national flags and embassies. Through these random strikes he wanted to promote  that nationalism is an outmoded concept which tends to promote disunity among the family of man. Learning that the heroCaptain Americawas going to make a public speech, Flag-Smasher held the crowd of hundreds attending the press conference hostage, forcing them to listen to his anti-nationalistic rhetoric. When the confrontation turned physical, Captain America overpowered the Flag-Smasher.[3]\nMorgenthau was deported from the country, but soon joined the subversive organizationU.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M., whose goals mirrored his own. He hijacked an airliner and held it hostage, demanding Captain America surrender to him. Cap tried to talk him down by agreeing with his vision of world peace, but disagreed with his methods. Cap was forced to take him down with the help ofS.H.I.E.L.D..[4]\nIt was later revealed the organization U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. was being funded by theNazicriminal, theRed Skull. Morgenthau, now fleeing for his life and hunted by his own people, was forced to team up with the newCaptain America (John Walker)along withBattlestar, the Captain (Steve Rogers) andDemolition Man. They thwarted their plot to set off a global EMP that would render all technology useless, though apparently at the cost of D-Man's life. He revealed that working with the Red Skull would destroy his integrity and ideals.[5]\nKarl usurped the leadership of U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. once again, and attempted to supply weapon to subversives in the US, but was stopped by the vigilantePunisherandMoon Knight.[6]He later tried to spread anarchy across the country by supplying weapons once again to ne'er-do-wells, but was stopped by theGhost Riderand the Punisher.[7]\nwith grey skin\nMorgenthau was captured and drugged byCalvin Halderman, the CEO ofRoxxonwho used him to secure the companies oil interests. The drug's mutated him into a monstrous grey creature with no high brain functions and forced to follow his master's orders. He was sent on a mission to assassinate a couple of reporters, who were investigating Roxxon. Captain America intervened and was forced to take down the mind control creature.[2]"

Most of the Akua dwell inCelestial Hawaiki, a small \"pocket\" dimension adjacent to Earth; an interdimensional nexus between Hawaiki and Earth exists somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, and the 12 floating, celestial islands that comprise Hawaiki are sometimes seen on the distant horizon at sunrise and sunset from the earthly plane.[1]Celestial Hawaiki is also inhabited by other beings below the Akua, such aswairua(spirits),tipua(goblins),taniwha(aquatic monsters) andpatupaiarehe(forest-dwelling, faerie-like creatures).[1]The Akua are called different names by their human worshipers; for example, the sea god Kanaloa is known as \"Tagaloa\" by the Samoans, \"Tangaloa\" by the Tongans, \"Ta'aroa\" by the Tahitians, and \"Tangaroa\" by the Maori of New Zealand.[1]The Akua are invoked by their worshipers on Earth in oral literature and genealogical recital even in modern times.[4]\nThe precise origin of the Akua, like that of all Earth's pantheons, is shrouded in legend. According to ancient myths, the primordian Earth Mother Gaea (Papahanaumoku or \"Papa\" in Hawaii, \"Papatuanuku\" in Maori) and the primordiak Sky Father Rangi (\"Ranginu,\" aka \"Wakea\" in Hawaii) coupled and gave birth to the first Akua; Light god Kane Milohai, sea agod Kanaloa, war god Ku, and peace and agriculture god Lono. Due to the constant tight embrace of Papa and Rangi, their offspring lived in eternal darkness.[1]The fierce war god Ku proposed that he and his brothers kill their parents in order to end the darkness; but Kane disagreed and instead used his might to physically push his parents apart, thus separating the sky from the earth and bringing light to the world. Kane became his brothers' leader and, with the childbirth goddess Haumea, sired many divine children who joined the Akua pantheon.[1]\nAlthough a daughter of Kane and Haumea, the volcano goddess Pele was born a mortal while her divine parents lived on Earth in ancient times. As Pele and her older sister Namaka, goddess of the sea, matured, they competed for the right to ascent to godhood like their other relatives, slowly accumulating the levels of mana needed to achieve superhuman feats. This caused much resentment between the two sisters, intensifying when the fiery Pele seduced Namaka's lover, Aukelenuiaiku. As Pele fled her sister's wrath, many fights between the fledgling goddesses erupted over the years, battles that created the Hawaiian isles by Pele's mastery of molten lava clashing with Namaka's control of the cooling water. Pele eventually died during these battles, but her father Kane resurrected and apotheosized her as a full-fledged goddess. Namaka spitefully prevented Pele from retrieving her mortal heart hidden within the Kilauea volcano on the island Hawai'i via enchantments that required noble-hearted warriors to retrieve it. In recent years, the subterranean-dwelling Lava Men stole Pele's heart to power the mighty Firebringer to destroy the surface world. Posing as the mutant Risque, Pele guided the mutant team X-Force to recover her heart and destroy the Firebringer. With her mortal heart finally retrieved, Pele returned to Hawaiki.[5]\nThe Akua all possess certain superhuman physical attributes."

The robotUdarnikfound it and discovered it was a powerful source of energy, with which he created his Lunar fortress, the \"Crimson Dynamo.\"[1]With the Phlogistone, Udarnik empowered weaponry he used to attack theEarthin order to draw the attention of humanity.[3]\nWhenIron Maninvestigated the attacks coming from Earth's satellite, he met Udarnik, with who he came to terms after being attacked. Udarnik showed Stark the power of the Phlogistone, at the same time he broadcasted to Earth the existence of this powerful material.[1]Humanity returned to the Moon and createda colony, from which investigations about Phlogistone and plans for extracting it begun.\nTony Stark, who had become the governor of the Moon, discovered that prolongued exposure to Phlogistone caused degenerative effects to the brain, including megalomania, obsession, psychosis, hallucinations, and eventually death.[4]\nFollowing this discovery, Stark planned to stop this material from reaching Earth by destroying it, for which he acquired the maps of all the Phlogistone deposits fromCortex Inc., one of the main mayor players in the search for this material, by breaking into their databank, a process which also helped him to plant evidence againstEli Warren, another contender for Phlogistone, to make him be kicked out of the Moon, possibly having actually succumbed to the obsession for Phlogistone and megalomaniac tendencies caused by the exposure to it.[5]\nFrom theDoctor Doomof analternate futurewho arrived to the present in order to empower himself with Phlogistone, Stark acquired a device which allowed to extract the Phlogistone's energies (which poisoned the brain) and render it simple iron. Before Stark could add the device to his armor in order to render the Phlogistone which was poisoning him inert, Udarnik captured him, as he had discovered Stark's plans to render Phlogistone useless.[6]"

In its raw state, Plasti-thene was a rubbery material that could absorb any force directed against it. Plasti-thene was porous enough to be air-permeable, so that a person trapped within it would not suffocate.[citation needed]\nUpon learning that theHulkhad been captured, the Leader went to themilitary baseand volunteered his services toGeneral Ross, to come up with a suitable method to contain the Hulk. The Leader then began working to create a Plasti-thene prison; his task finally completed, the Leader presented the \"living cage\" of Plasti-thene to Ross. The wagon with the Hulk on it was rolled into the mound, and the Leader used theSealer Beamto close the entrance, trapping the jade giant inside a small open area within the mound. The Hulk awoke and easily broke free of the restraints on the wagon, but he was unable to punch through the Plasti-thene. He next grabbed the wagon and hurled it at the wall, but the wagon only bounced back at him. Seeing that he couldn't break through the walls, the Hulk next tried to smash through the floor, but the force of the shockwave only reflected back at him, leaving him the helpless prisoner of the Leader.[1]\nWhile the Hulk was imprisoned within the Plasti-thene, the Leader began preparations to initiate his secret agenda, using the military base's missiles to start a nuclear war.Betty Rossslipped off and found the Sealer Beam, then she reversed the power on the device and freed the Hulk from the Plasti-thene cage. Following a brief battle between the Hulk and the Leader'sSuper Humanoid, the Leader fired a handgun at the Hulk and enveloped the jade giant's body with a blob of Plasti-thene, entrapping him again.[2]"

The metal was developed in theUSSR.[1]\nOmega Redhad carbonadium coils through which he could transmit his ability to drain life energies. Carbonadium was highly radioactive and objects composed of it had proven to slow accelerated healing factors such asWolverine's. The only device that could stop this radiation was theCarbonadium Synthesizer, which had been hidden on the deceased body of adouble-agentwho died whenTeam Xstole it and escaped from Omega Red during their last mission.[2]\nMore recently, the Carbonadium Synthesizer was retrieved byDraculawho tasked Omega Red to infiltrateKrakoaand lureWolverineto one of Dracula's hideouts inParisin order to allow Dracula's soldiers to steal Wolverine's blood. Once done, Wolverine's blood was then transferred to Dracula, allowing him to now survive when exposed to daylight.

TheIntergalactic Empire of Wakandadeclined the offer, but all other Galactic Council members accepted. Brand offered to donate more mysterium to the Galactic Council to back the credit or use mysterium as the basis for a new unit of currency (\"TheSol\").

Her major enemies areKenneth Irons(whom she briefly dated before discovering his evil nature) andIan Nottingham(sometime love-interest and ally).\nSara first appeared inCyblade/Shi #1: The Battle For Independentsin 1995. She had wanted nothing more in her life than to be a good cop. As a homicide detective in New York City, life was challenging enough, but for Sara, those were simpler times. While on an undercover case at the Rialto Theater, both she and her partner, Michael Yee (named Danny Woo in the TV series), were mortally wounded. At this same theater was a man named Kenneth Irons, who had brought a gauntlet known as the Witchblade. Irons was in search of the secrets to unlocking its full power and ability.\nWhile Sara lay dying, the Witchblade made his choice to include her in the long line of women that he has shared his power with. The entity healed Sara's wounds and allowed her to survive the resulting confrontation. Since then, she has seen many things she never knew existed, fought creatures that have no place on Earth, and longed for the days of a typical NYPD detective. But she continues her struggle with the Witchblade, believing that she can do more good with the entity than without. So the battle for control continues, as Sara learns more about this entity and struggles to stem his violent nature.\nSome of Sara's allies include the Magdalena,Lara Croft, and Jackie Estacado. One crossover pitted her against Wolverine. In the comics recently, Sara has been through a grueling ordeal fighting off a giant demon (a false \"god\" summoned by a group of priests), in the midst of which her partner, Jake McCarthy, was left wounded. Before losing consciousness, Jake professed his love for Sara and told her that he always knew about her double life. He now remains in a coma, and Sara has had to deal with a nosy new partner, Patrick Gleason, who has already discovered many of her secrets. Gleason saved her life and it had begun to look like they may become more than just partners, but their sexual date was interrupted when Ian Nottingham abruptly returned to Sara's life.\nAfter a minor crisis that led to the death of Sara's good friend and loyal partner, Jake, Sara discovered she was pregnant. Sara was completely confounded at how this occurred – due primarily to the fact she has not had sex in over a year. Sara, initially feeling she was not ready to be a mother, nevertheless decided to keep the baby, but decided as a result she could not keep the Witchblade as well. Sara relinquished it on to Danielle Baptiste, a young woman she had recently met who was its next chosen bearer.\nWhen she was due to give birth, the father of her child was revealed – it was Jackie Estacado, who, \"possessed\" by the Darkness itself, was driven to seek out and have sex with Sara's comatose body, and, with Jackie's body used for the necessary biology, leading to the conception of their baby – a child to upset the balance between the dark and light. Sara gives birth to a baby girl, but is on the verge of death. Danielle then ends up sharing part of the Witchblade with Sara, which saves Sara's life. Hope, Sara and Jackie's daughter, drives off The Angelus and in the end Sara, now wielding half The Witchblade, and her friends return to their lives. This pregnancy has caused an attraction between Jackie and Sara that has manifested itself as romantic and even sexual.\nLater, a major conflict erupts between Sara and Danielle, with Sara under the control of the Darkness portion of the Witchblade. During this time Sara became increasingly irrational, angry and would often mistreat the people around her, however she did display more increased control over the entity demonstrating abilities usually associated with the Darkness (summoning dark-based objects, creating Darklings etc.). Manipulated by an old enemy of the Curator, Sara re-took all of The Witchblade in a battle with Danielle. However Sara was saved when Danielle was chosen as the next Angelus host and cleansed her of the Darkness' influence, restoring Sara to her former self.\nWhile Sara attempts to redeem herself for her crimes under the Darkness-half of the Witchblade, an Internal Affairs agent named Phipps discovered the truth about the Witchblade through Jake McCarthy's diary. He confronted Sara, demanding that she either resign as a detective or give up the Witchblade if she doesn't want to be exposed. Sara chose the former. She then moves to Chicago, working as a private investigator.\nSara is a strong, determined, and mature woman. One of her defining characteristics is her black-and-white view of the world and of people, something that many characters in the series have called her out on.\nSara Pezzini (Comics)/Gallery"

The Amazons had been created around 1200 B.C. when the Greek goddesses drew forth the souls of all women who had been murdered by men and placed them on the island. One soul was held back from creation, the one that would be born as Diana. That soul originally belonged to the unborn daughter of the first woman murdered by a man (whom Hippolyta was the reincarnation of).\nIn the late 20th Century, Hippolyta was instructed to mold some clay from the shores of Paradise Island into the form of a baby girl. Six members of the Greek Pantheon then bonded the soul to the clay, giving it life. Each of the six also granted Diana a gift: Demeter, great strength; Athena, wisdom and courage; Artemis, a hunter's heart and a communion with animals; Aphrodite, beauty and a loving heart; Hestia, sisterhood with fire; Hermes, speed and the power of flight. Diana grew up surrounded by a legion of sisters and mothers.\nWonder Woman together with the rest of JLA inspectedHuntresswho came into contact with the fragment from the artifact, concluding that she has bonded with a fragment fromSara'sWitchblade. Once the symbiote spreads to the brain, it searches for any weak point in the personality psycho-matrix it can exploit. Much to everyone's shock, the fragment then joins back with the Witchblade. At the Atlantis library,Aquamandiscovers what he was looking for earlier about the Witchblade, and rushes off to tell the League. He reveals that more than ten thousands years ago, there existed a sorceress with a powerful gauntlet just like Sara's. They called it \"corruptor, possessor, slayer and seducer.\"\nMeanwhile, Wonder Woman, while examining the Witchblade, becomes the unknowing host. Wonder Woman is not immediately overcome, as her pure spirit saves her. As the Witchblade \"disappeared\", the JLA searches for it. Sara wakes up for a few seconds, surprised to see the Witchblade gone.Martian Manhuntersenses a turmoil in Wonder Woman, but she calms him down, saying that she is perfectly fine. They're then informed by Wonder Woman that Witchblade disappeared and JLA goes to search for it.\nWonder Woman gives a speech on women in the 21st century inU.N. Symposium, when she's overcome by the Witchblade  and declares that women around the world should rise up and throw off the yoke of patriarchal tyranny. She then beats up two UN senators who doesn't listen to her. She then senses the same machines sent byLex Luthorwho attacked the Witchblade before and goes after them.\nThe JLA confronts Wonder Woman, who easily defeatsSuperman. TheFlashthen quickly takes him to project Cadmus were he can be taken care of. The JLA try to restrain Wonder Woman, but she manages to overpower all of them.

Ripping through the mysterious false reality imposed upon them (issue #1), they discover that they've been abducted and imprisoned on a huge, living spacecraft high in Earth orbit, an ever-changing prison ship controlled by the mind of a madman. Their fellow inmates? Swarms of Aliens, legions of Predators, and acidic fear. It's a grudge match in floating hell!\nPreviously\nThe story opens up with Jackie and Sara trapped in Kenneth Irons nightmare world, where Earth is overrun by Xenomorphs. The pair are then attacked by facehuggers. Irons explains that in his future, Earth is a scorched wasteland and has an alien hive. He declares that it's Sara's fault.

Jackie then loses his powers because of sunlight. The Xenomorph is then killed by a Predator just as Sister Midnight returns. Sara, Jackie and Sister Midnight manage to get inside the shuttle and escape as the ship explodes. Sara notices that something else has gotten inside, but Jackie calms her down saying that it's just a Darkling. She then prepares to fight the Sister Midnight before Jackie stops her, declaring that she isn't targeting them. Her true target is revealed to be a Darkling-Xenomorph hybrid, much to Irons amusement.To be continued..."

The device is a portable library of intergalactic genetic data that allowed the wielder to alter their DNA at will and rapidly transform into a variety of different alien species, each with their own unique abilities.\nThe Omnitrix was destroyed inThe Final Battle: Part 2by Ben and replaced with theUltimatrix.\nIn its first form that Ben encountered, the Omnitrix looked like a large wristwatch with a wide band, primarily black and grey in color. It had a dark grey faceplate in the middle (like a watch dial) that had a green hourglass shape (the symbol of universal peace/Galvan Tech) on it.[DM 1]The faceplate was part of a cylindrical tower; when Ben selected his aliens, the tower would pop up from the base of the Omnitrix, and the hourglass would invert into a diamond and show the aliens' silhouettes. The band had an activation button on the side facing the user if on their left hand. The ring of the faceplate had four symmetrical lights that would glow with the hourglass symbol. Finally, the band had two rings of white tubing, that would glow green under special circumstances.\nInDestroy All AliensandOmniverseflashbacks, the Omnitrix looks the same as in theOriginal Series, but with two buttons instead of one.\nAfter its reconfiguration, the Omnitrix resembled a slimmer and sleeker watch-like shape, now with a green wristband, and the face of the dial becoming black and green. The inside of the hourglass symbol glowed in different colors during certain moments; these colors signify the mode that the Omnitrix was presently in. When Ben is selecting his aliens it shows the alien's hologram standing on the core rather than the alien's silhouette.\nInAlien Swarm, the Omnitrix looks mostly the same as inAlien Forceexcept it is a darker shade of green.\nInRace Against TimeTimelinethe Omnitrix looks exactly same as in theOriginal Series, but the tubes are grey. When the core pops up, it glows green.\nInTime HealsTimeline, the Omnitrix looks exactly same.\nThe Omnitrix was created byAzmuthas a tool of peace in an act of repentance following the destruction caused by his previous creation,Ascalon, a weapon of terrible power.[4]\nTo the rest of the universe, the Omnitrix had a two-fold purpose. One was to promote inter-species understanding by allowing other beings to experience different ways of life.[1]The other was to function as a repository for the DNA of over a million different species that Azmuth thought were intelligent.[DM 2]The samples were scanned, and when necessary, repaired.[DM 3]This collection of DNA was then preserved in the event that any of the species catalogued were rendered extinct, allowing the Omnitrix to restore them to life.[5]\nUnbeknownst to everyone else, Azmuth had a third reason for creating the Omnitrix. He hoped that his estranged loverZennith, who had left him as he created Ascalon, would learn of his change and come back to him.[4]\n\nActive Mode (Prototype)\n–Ben, explaining how the Omnitrix works.[6]\nActive Mode (Reconfigured)\n\n\nRecharge Mode (Prototype)\nWhen the Omnitrix's usage time is fully depleted (i.e. \"times out\"), it goes into Recharge Mode: firstly warning of the timing out; then detransforming the user and locking all functions of Active Mode while the Omnitrix recharges.It takes around 5 minutes to recharge, though it may take more time if tampered with.[citation needed]Recharge Mode's main purpose is to prevent the alien DNA from attaching permanently to its host.[pop-up 2][8][pop-up 3][DVD 1]\nThe Omnitrix is powered by a special self-renewable power supply that will long outlive Ben.[citation needed]\nThe Omnitrix is capable of detecting when its host is in any sort of life-threatening distress. Specifically, it can instantly recharge to protect the user from a direct physical threat. This was shown when Ben was stuck to a wall about to be killed byKevin 11[9]and whenZs'Skayrtried to possess Ben.[10]Both times, despite just timing out within a minute earlier, the Omnitrix recharges instantly when the user's life is put in direct threat.This feature was switched off after the reconfiguration.[citation needed]\nIf the user is knocked out or hurt enough, the Omnitrix will revert them to their normal form.\nRecharge Mode (Reconfigured)\nThe reconfigured Omnitrix times out with no warning due to the warning being switched off when the Omnitrix reconfigured. When the Omnitrix was repairing the DNAliens' to make them human again, the Omnitrix went into Recharge Mode after a while.[5]\n\n\nCollect Mode (Prototype)\n–AzmuthandGwen.[14]\nWhen a new DNA sample has been unlocked from theCodon Stream, or when the Omnitrix captures new DNA not present in the Codon Stream, Collect Mode is activated. It can also reclaim lost or removed alien DNA that was in the Codon Stream.\nIt scans to match the species, then moves the identified species to the active playlist. If it's seen the species before, it does it passively, without Ben actively scanning.[DM 7]\nCollect Mode (Reconfigured)\nUnlike in theOriginal Series, the Omnitrix inAlien Forcewould not scan by touch (due to its reconfiguration).\n\n\nSelf-Destruct Mode (Prototype)\n–Myaxx.[1]\nIn Self-Destruct Mode, the Omnitrix charges energy while counting down until it explodes. S.D.M. functions as a last resort should the Omnitrix fall into the wrong hands.[1]It can be activated by Voice Command.[15]\nWhen in S.D.M. for a few days, the Omnitrix can charge enough energy to cause an energy ripple that will destroy the entire universe. While in S.D.M., the Omnitrix can send out energy bursts capable of throwing the user through the air.\nWhen the S.D.M. is activated, the Omnitrix sends out a signal that any ship can pick up (unless it was activated by Voice Command), such as when Vilgax picked it up with a stolen ship and Tetrax picked up the signal, likely as a distress signal.[1]\nSelf-Destruct Mode (Reconfigured)\n\n\nReconfiguration\nThe Omnitrix begins to reconfigure while selecting a set of new aliens.\nWhen Ben put the Omnitrix back on his arm after a couple of years, the Omnitrix took a new sample of Ben's DNA, adjusted itself to his current biochemistry and physically reconfigured itself to what it guessed were his needs.[HG Bible 1]\nThe Omnitrix would transform (reconfigure) itself as Ben gets older, giving him more control and access to more aliens.[pop-up 4][16][TP 1]\nThe Omnitrix makes a beep-like noise, the hourglass turns blue, then it changes to a glowing black and green and morphs into its new shape.[17]\nThe Omnitrix has hundreds of different forms (this is to fit different users).[DM 9]\nThe Omnitrix gives its wielder a new set of aliens depending on whether it is a hard or soft reset.[DM 10]\n\n–Azmuth, explaining the dangers of overusing the quick-change feature.[25]\nThe following list shows all known transformations during the timeframe of theOriginal SeriesandOmniverseflashbacks. Unless noted, all of these transformations were locked by the Omnitrix's reconfiguration inBen 10 Returns: Part 1.\nThe following list shows all transformations unlocked during the timeframe ofAlien Forcesince the Omnitrix's reconfiguration. Unless noted, all of these transformations were transferred into theUltimatrixprior to the Omnitrix's destruction inThe Final Battle: Part 2. The Omnitrix had 1,000,903 genetic samples inWar of the Worlds: Part 1, and after that it also reacquiredGhostfreakinGhost Townand createdNanomechinBen 10: Alien Swarm. The Omnitrix had at least 1,000,905 genetic samples prior to its destruction.\nThese mergers are the result of a malfunction in the Omnitrix due to the user damaging the device."

        "content": "SaviorYoungOldBiographical InformationRace:HumanGender:FemaleStatus:AliveCharacter InformationAffiliation:Witchblade(Bearer)Unnamed Kid(Grandson)Occupation:PilotReal World InformationFirst Appearance:Battle of the Planets/Witchblade\n\nTheSavioris an unnamed little girl who becomes a bearer of theWitchbladein theBattle of the Planets/Witchbladecrossover comic.\nThe Savior lived with her mother in the east central European country ofBelarustogether with her mother. At some point, the hostile aliens known asSpectra, invaded Earth in order to strip the land of a rich biological resource known as peat. Although it was a simple fertilizer to humans, to the invaders it was the priceless source material for their powerful terraforming engines.\nTogether with her mother, the girl spent years under the repression of the invaders. Eventually due to the lack of malnutrition and lack of even the most basic medical care her mother dies. After this, the Savior swears to help others and begins to steal food and medication for other prisoners and workers. By doing this, the girl gains notoriety as a little freedom fighter that would dare challenge the great might of Spectra.\nYears later, as Spectra unearthed a citadel holding an ancient artifact, a stranger is captured by the invaders. As the stranger is thrown into her cell, the girl manages to sneak into it and bring food and medication to the prisoners. After taking some food, the two other prisoners decide to investigate the stranger. As they approach her, the stranger does a back flip and cuts free her binds into the rock behind her. This display of extreme physical prowess comes at the cost of her own strength and she asks the girl to give her water. The girl points out that, other prisoners are afraid of the stranger except for her. Stranger tells, that they shouldn't be afraid as she's here to help them. The girl says that she knew this the moments she saw her and asks the stranger how did she break free of her restraints. Stranger explains, that the acoustics in the cell revealed the dimensions of her confinement and the smell clued her that they where underground, hence shark rock walls.\nThe stranger the proceeds to take out a pill out of a secret compartment in her boot heel, which will counteract the tranquilizer darts the invaders shot her with. She then reassures the girl, that as soon as she contacts her friends they will be shutting this place down and get everyone to safety. The stranger then realizes that her bracelet is gone and begins frantically search for it, only for the girl to reveal her, that the invaders took it. They then hear, that the invaders are coming back and the girl tells the stranger to pretend that she is still in her restraints. The girl then proceeds to hide in a vent.\nAfter the guards leave, the stranger comes up with a plan to free the prisoners and defeat the invaders. Meanwhile the girl is tasked in finding out more about the artifact, that Spectra have unearthed. To accomplish this, the Savior infiltratesReinhart'stent, who is a resident specialist investigating the artifact. Although she manages to sneak into the tent, she clumsily alerts her presence to Reinhart. At gunpoint, Reinhart reveals that he has heard stories about the little freedom fighter that would dare challenge the great might of Spectra. Reinhart also adds, that if not for her young age, the Witchblade would have chosen her to become its bearer. The girl then tells Reinhart that a powerful stranger has arrived who's going to free them. Reinhart says, that he's fully aware of her as the Witchblade became quite antsy the moment she arrived on Earth. Their conversation is then interrupted by a series of explosions going off outside.\nThe stranger manages to free the prisoners and attacks the invaders, but their fight is short lived when Reinhart forces them to give up or he will kill the girl. Stranger is then brought to the citadel in front of the artifact. Reinhart reveals that although he doesn't who she is or where she came from, the Witchblade has taken a liking to her and she won't be denied. Throughout history multiple women wore the Witchblade, women just like her. Reinhart also says, that the Witchblade is his life's obsession and he sold his soul to the devil, so to speak, in order to witness it. He then forces the stranger to put on the artifact. As she approaches it, the Witchblade takes possession of the stranger and notices an artifact of great power inside of her. Bonded with the Witchblade, the stranger is forced to attack anyone in sight. During the confusion created by the massacre, the little girl escapes from Reinhart's grasps.\nG-Force then arrives to the planet and face-off against both their possessed teammate and Spectra soldiers. Meanwhile, the girl takes and brings the stolen stranger's bracelets back to her teammates. The bracelets push out the Witchblade from the stranger, freeing her from its control. The stranger then thanks the little girl for helping her. The girl tells that she wants to be a hero just like Princess when she grows up, but stranger answers that she already is one. As relief workers come to help the wounded denizens, the little girl finds the Witchblade, now in the form of a bracelet and proceeds to put it on.\nAfter becoming the new bearer of the Witchblade, the little girl aided the authorities in capture of Reinhart. Years later, she became the first woman pilot to be recruited by Red Impulse. Over the next few years, the little girl with the help of the Witchblade, destroys hordes of aliens and marauders, becoming an ace pilot and a hero back on Earth.\nMany years later, now an old women, the girl calls her grandson back home in fear of wolves that roam restless this season. She gives the boy food and promises to tell him a story if he eats all of it. The old lady then lets him pick, which one does he want to hear, \"Decoys of Doom\", \"Curse of the Cuttlefish\", \"Race Against Disaster\" or \"The Fierce Flowers\". The boy instead wants to hear his favorite one, the one about the Princess. Hearing this, the old lady gets frustrated as she already told him this story hundred of times, but decides to comply.\nWhen she finishes telling her story, she puts her grandson to sleep. The Witchblade then complaints of its portrayal as a villain in her stories. The Witchblade adds that its because it, that the little girl became a hero among her people, eventually becoming an ace pilot. The old lady answers that she's not listening to it. The Witchblade then asks if they could at least kill the wolves. The old lady agrees, but decides to only frighten them as they have been thrashing her garden. But first she makes few more entries in her memoirs called \"Savior: A Hero's Tale\".\nEven at young age, the Savior showed incredible courage. After her mother death, the girl swore to never stand by and watch the needless death of human life. Thus, she risked her own life by stealing food and medication from Spectra and handing it to her oppressed fellow people. These acts even give her some notoriety among the Spectra.\nThis drive and focus eventually leads the little girl to becoming a worthy bearer of the Witchblade."

Years of investigating these murders had an impact on her mental health. She then quit the force, only to be discovered six months later making homemade porn films packed with subliminal messages. Because of this, she was arrested for coercion of men to do illegal acts using narcotic therapy.\nWhile being in prison, she and four other prisoners were chosen as test subjects for a new experimental age retardant calledSustain.Esther Dannenwas the first one to be injected with the experimental Sustain dosage. Unfortunately, the dosage was hundreds of times what people would take in the future. Dannen appeared to die under that dosage and the corpse was placed into storage, where it stayed for three years.\nMeanwhile, Selena was also subjected to the Sustain, which caused her mental state to decline even more. At some point afterward, Selena gains the Witchblade and escapes toDowntown, where she begins to experiment with it on the denizens living there.\nYears later, she found out that detectiveJohn Chimuis trying to track her down as she is the only other other law officer to investigate murders besides Kenneth Pezzini, who isn't available at the moment. When Chimu reaches Downtown, she sends of herfriendto apprehend him and bring him to her hostel.\nAfter Chimu recovers from his blackout, Selena approaches him. She says she is interested in doing the case if he will guarantee her safe passage and no persecution be given to her while the case is ongoing. Chimu reluctantly agrees and sets hiscomputerto do Selena's request. While doing this, he notices the tentacles returning to the gauntlet on Selena's hand.\nChimu recognizes Selena's gauntlet as the Witchblade. He read about it in one of the things from the police files before the Days of the Accelaration. Selena doesn't answers about the Witchblade, but mentioned they already have to move as her link to her people is now closed. They will now awaken and it may spell trouble to them. The two leave as the people began to wake up asking Selena not to disconnect.\nJohn brings Selena to the murder scene ofGeoffrey Kuhnand his secretaryGetz Muller. After inspecting the scene, Selena smokes a cigarette, which displeases Chimu and reveals that this isn't the work of a serial killer. Selena explains that it's a revenge killing as it's too cold, deliberate and specific to be a serial killer's job. She then directs her focus to the secretary's corpse.\nThe second corpse puzzles Chimu as the victim had sex with the killer. He questions Selena if the killer was the victims girlfriend or close friend. Selena denies this, explaining, that death is the great aphrodisiac. The killer had sex with her victim because of the murder and she then killed him because, he either was a witness or maybe because she felt like a black widow.\nSelena then proceeds to seduce Chimu and have sex with him. During the sexual intercourse, Selena connects her Witchblade tendril to his head. Later Chimu questions as to why she connected with him. Selena evades the question, asking him if he didn't like it. Chimu answers that he didn't, but he would like to do it again. Selena tells him, that they might as well as he probably already knows who made the killings. Chimu is confused as he has no idea, who the killer is.\nThis amuses Selena and she reveals that Kuhn was a member of Sustain team, the people responsible for creating the age retardant. Once Sustain was fully developed, the team chose to drop below the publicity horizon. They names were never revealed, except to intelligence. As Chimu activates his comms, he's informed that there was another killing. The victim isAndrea Tyleran one hundred twenty-three year old geneticist. After hearing this, Selena reveals that she was on the Sustain team, too.\nAt the murder scene, Selena explains that taking the victims hands, eyes, tongue, nose and ears are the killer's point. She then reanimates Andrea's corpse with help of the Witchblade, which sickens Chimu. Selena proceeds to ask Andrea, who killed her. Andrea reluctantly answers that it was Esther Dannen, the first test subject of Sustain. Chimu recognizes the name as the volunteer forensic discovery team member, he met earlier. He tells the officers the find her immediately.\nChimu then threatens Selena with his pistol and forces her to tell him the whole story, regarding the Sustain team. Selena reveals that there were five people on the Sustain team, and five human testbeds. Esther Dannen was the first, and the worst. During the early days, the Sustain dosage were hundreds of times what people take today. Dannen appeared to die under that dosage and the corpse was placed in storage, where it stayed for three years. In reality it was a Sustain induced blackout, that lasted three years. During the entire time, her mind was awake, locked in a black prison of complete sensory deprivation.\nSelena continues, telling that Dannen, like the other four test subjects, including Selena herself, were psychopaths, taken from prison. At some point, Dannen managed to escape from her prison and sought revenge against the scientists. With a new identity as a police forensic scientist she started to hunt down the scientists, one by one. Selena also adds, that Dannen takes her victims appendages in order to show them what she went through, while being in complete sensory deprivation. As she tells this story, Selena by using the Witchblade, takes Chimu's gun from his hands and destroys it. She then proceeds to kiss him.\nTogether with Selena, Chimu goes to Dannen's apartment. As they enter the apartment, they confront Dannen. Dannen reveals that she manages to kill another scientist, Rajiv Siva, while they were searching for her. The woman decides to peacefully give herself in for the corrective therapy. Chimu instead shoots her in the head. Knowing that Chimu now faces corrective therapy, Selena offers to join her in Downtown. Understanding that he's now under the influence of Selena and overwhelmed with all the violence he witnessed, Chimu decides to take his own life. Selena then decides to cover up this and replace Chino as the new detective for Manhattan.\nSelena is a cold, manipulative person. She knows how to make people fall in love with her and often uses this to manipulate others. Combined with her ruthlessness and intelligence, this makes her a force to be reckoned with. She's also a nymphomaniac, who often partakes in sexual intercourse with various individuals in strange places, like a room with a corpse in it."

The son of Satan in a bid to assume control of Hell has sent an emissary to earth with a wedding invitation for Vampirella. Detective Sara Pezzini thinks she knows evil, but when a little girl carrying a severed head starts a bloody rampage in a New York hospital, her definition is about to be redefined. Drawn together by fate and circumstance, Vampirella and Witchblade stand on the front lines of a battle for dominion over hell withDrakulonhanging in the balance.\nA young girl walks down the street during the rain. An old woman approaches the girl and as if she's lost. The girl tells the woman to go away. Old woman then insists that the girl should seek shelter and bets that her doll would agree with her. As the old lady moves the cloth to see the girl's doll, she's shocked to see it actually be a decapitated man's head. Soon after, the girl is taken to a hospital, where doctors and Sara Pezzini overseer her.\nAfter three doctors try to take the head by force, the girl puts them all in a critical condition. They then send Doctor Wrightson to convince her to give up the head. The little girl refuses to tell the doctor her name and explains that the head is actually an invitation. She then tells that someone is here and now they can get started. Outside the room, Sara and other doctors lose all connection to the room. Doctors Wrightson head then proceeds to explode and the girl writes an invitation to a wedding on a wall with his blood. Sara rushes into the room realizing, that the girl isn't human. Out of no where, Vampirella comes into the room, recognizing the girl as Balaala and asks her what is she doing here on Earth.\nBalaala explains that Vampirella's presence is required elsewhere and uses the head to open up a vortex of fire and blood, sending Sara and the vampire to Hell, while also destroying the hospital.

Hearing that Vampirella is a vampire from Hell, Sara blames her for all of these events on her. She also points out how absurd her clothes are to which Vampirella notes that her Witchblade armor is no better. The girls then punch Damien, having used their little argument as a distraction.

He then adds that heir marriage wouldn't last long as he plans to kill her during the reception.\nVampirella tells him, that there will be no wedding and he should leave this place, otherwise she and Sara will send him home to daddy in pieces.

During the fight, Sara goes into a bloody frenzy and must fight to not lose control over body to the Witchblade. With the demon army destroyed, Damien himself then faces them. Although he lands few successful hits, Sara and Vampirella combine their Witchblade's into a singular spear-sword and proceed to decapitate Damien.\nWith Damien dead, Lucifer emerges and thanks Vampirella for killing his son.

Myra recognises Alex, having seen her in the news, but Alex ignores this point.\nDetectives wife is doubtful, that she has any chance to win against her husband in court. Myra then gives Alex a photo of her and Blake, so someone know just how much of a liar he is, if something happens to her. Alex asks her if Myra is okay to go back to the hotel and she reassures Underwood, that Blake isn't foolish enough to brake the restraining order in broad daylight. Debbie isn't so sure and suggests Alex to find the maid who supposedly saw Blake beating up Myra.\nAlex does this, but notices Blake following her. Believing to have lost him in the subway, Alex goes to interview his housekeeper. As she climbs up the fire escape ladder onto the roof, she's shot in the chest and falls off the building.

The man also knows about the visions she has saw. Alex then collapses on the ground. In her subconscious, Alex sees a familiar woman, named Meg with a half burned face. The woman explains, that this is her mind's attempt to process the trauma of the last few hours. Alex doesn't understand why is she seeing this as she has been taking her medication and sees Dr. Hawkins twice a week for a therapy. Meg tells her, that this isn't her PSTD or anything else for that matter. This is happening in reality. Alex then begins to bleed from her abdomen, much to her confusion. Meg tells her to stop fighting what brought her back and wake up.\nAs Alex wakes up, she finds herself in the apartment of the man, she met in the alleyway. She's pissed, that someone attacked her and now she is being held as hostage by some creep. The man tells her, that she can leave whenever she wants and only took her to his apartment for safety. He continues, telling her, that the artifact hasn't completely merged with her and Alex is at her most vulnerable until the host transfer is complete. Alex doesn't believe him and decides to leave. The man tries to talk her out of this action by telling her, that a scavenger already has tried to kill her in her apartment. He warns Alex, that next time it will be something worse.\nAlex still doesn't believe him, thinking he's crazy. The man tells her, that she should stop resisting the artifact as it kills the hosts who reject it. He then asks, what are her last memories. Alex tells him, that yesterday the husband of one her clients was following her. Believing to have lost him in the subway, Alex goes to interview his housekeeper. As she climbs up the fire escape ladder onto the roof, she's shot in the chest and falls off the building. Alex then asks the man if this is hell. The man explains, that this is opposite of hell and the power of the artifact comes from the moment of host's death. It gives life, but the price is, that she has been seeing and hearing strange things.\nAfter hearing all this, Alex decides to go to check on Myra, much to her guardians objections. He suggests, that she should wait another few days, until the artifact bonds with her. Alex disregards his warnings and proceeds to leave. Outside, she tries to get the Witchblade in its bracelet form, off of her hand. The Witchblade warns Alex, that if she does it, she will die. The artifact tells her, that it needs a host to survive, to give it voice and flesh. And in return, the Witchblade will gift her with visions of the past and future and incredible power, as she is its host.\nAlex then calls, Debbie who reveals, that without the maidens statement, Blake has been released. Hearing this. she rushes to Myra's apartment. As Alex walks into the apartment, she finds Blake holding Myra at gunpoint. Myra then bites Blake's arm in order to get the pistol. Although she succeeds, Blake punches her and then prepares to shoot her. Blake tells Myra, that if she didn't the drive, she be in an oil drum in the East River by now. Myra responds by telling him to shoot her already as it has to be better than spending another second with him. Before Blake can do that, Alex conjures multiple appendages, which impale him.\nAlex checks the detectives vitals, realizing, that she killed him. She apologizes to Myra for what she has done, but the wife isn't sorry for this. As the police arrives, Myra tells the officers, that Alex saved her life as Blake was about kill them both.

He calms her down, saying that he would never willfully let the Witchblade hurt her. Ash continues by telling Alex, that he can teach her how to control it. Alex then asks Ash to explain her what this thing is and make it stop. Ash tells her, that no one knows where it came from. What they do know is that, the Witchblade is a weapon, meant to fight all the darkness and evil, that normal humans can't see. The artifact only chooses special women, chosen for their place in history's darkest hours. Because Alex has been chosen at the moment of her death, her bond to the artifact is especially strong.\nAsh then tells her to stop fighting the Witchblade and begin to listen to it as monsters that she's meant to destroy will try to eliminate her while she is still new and vulnerable. After listening to Ash, Alex returns to her apartment, where she washes the blood from her face. She then begins to cry and takes a drink. Meanwhile, someone at the street watches her apartments window. When Alex notices this, the man disappears. Later, Alex goes to her office.

Alex also notices, that all the officers bear a strange tattoo on their body just like Blake. Accompanied by Ash, Alex goes to morgue in order to inspect Blake's corpse. Unfortunately, Ash doesn't recognise the tattoo. Blake then wakes up and pushes Ash out of the room. He then grabs Alex and pushes her on the ground. As Blake slowly walks to her, indenting to killer her, Alex grabs an electric saw and cuts off his arm, bearing the strange tattoo. Noticing, that the hand began to smoke, Alex grabs a scalpel and stabs the hand, killing Blake.\nOutside the morgue, Alex decides to go to ER, but Ash tells her to give the nerves a few hours to knit and she 'will be good as new. Ash then leaves Alex alone, saying that he's supposed to protect the Witchblade and not the wielder and until she begins to use using the weapon as it was intended, she will be on her own. Instead of giving up, Alex visits a nightclub, that Blake's colleague visit. She notices footprints leading to the VIP area filled with off-duty cops. The bouncer then tells her to go away before the cops arrest her for disturbance. Alex counters this by saying, that she will tell her friend at the network about cops having a relationship with Russian mobster Ivan Tenebrev. The bouncer then tells her to leave for her own good and Alex decides to comply.\nAfter leaving the club, Alex calls Debbie, wanting to meet her at a bar. Debbie agrees, but first must to drop off the flash drive to her investigators. A man then attacks Debbie from behind, beats her up and takes the drive.

As Barrows takes Alex out of the room, she notices, that his boots leave the same footprints seen at the club. She then tells her to stay away from her, when she sees the same strange tattoo on his neck. Barrows tells her, that Debbie isn't the only one they can get. He then shows the footage of Mr. Underwood walking home. After seeing this, Alex tells Barrows, that although she doesn't know what that mark means, but if he hurts her loved ones, there will be no place on this Earth he can hide from her. Hearing, that Alex can see his mark, scares Barrows and he proceeds to run away.\nAlthough Alex has a strong feeling, that tipping her hand was a mistake, revealing to be not as helpless as she looks, she feels good about her decision.\nAlex takes couple drinks in a bar and then leaves. As she walks down the street, she notices Ash following her. Ash says to her, that its his duty to look after her and she let him at least tech Alex how to control the Witchblade.

As they take her away, Alex sees strange, dark presence in the mirror behind Perdida.\nAfter seeing this, Alex decides to seek answers and meets antique seller, Majil. Majil is displeased with seeing Alex in her shop as she convinced him into testifying against Russian mobsters. Alex then shows him the Blake Groves sewered hand, bearing the strange tattoo. Majil asks if the guy to which the hand belongs is dead and Alex confirms this, although she doesn't explain how it happened. After taking look at a book, Majil explains that the tattoo is a hex mark, which lets witches and demons commune with or otherwise inhabit humans. He then notices Alex bracelet and asks to take a closer look. Alex disapproves this as the Witchblade stings Majil's hand.\nThe Witchblade then warns Alex about danger as someone has followed her to this shop. Then out of a mirror, a black, mass of tentacles attack them. The Witchblade then tells Alex to stop fighting it and use it to kill the monster. Although Alex manages to cut few tentacles off the monster they quickly attach back. The monster then hits her, knocking Alex to the ground. Alex then asks Majil if he can see the monster and he confirms he can. Although Alex tries to kill the monster, the creature overpowers her and prepares to kill her. Before it can do that, Majil uses a fire extinguisher to destroy the creature. Majil then asks what that creature was and Alex believes, that was some kind of projection, she met earlier, which likes mirrors. Alex is curious about Majil as he is the second only person to actually see both her powers and the monster, which attacked them. She decides to go and deal with this situation, but promises to talk with him later.\nBefore she leaves, she sees a projection ofBlake, who tells her, that although she took his body, she can't kill that never dies. He then warns Alex, that he will be seeing her soon enough. As she travels back home, Alex notices someone following her. She at first believes it to be Ash, but instead he sees a man, who gives her the picture of Debbie, warning her, that although they can't get her, they still can hurt her. He then tells Alex, that she can't stop them and should quit trying.\nAfter hearing this, Alex pays a visit to Perdida Duncan in the prison. Perdida reveals, that she will transfered to Rikers tomorrow after the bail hearing. Alex tells her, that she shouldn't worry as there no evidence she did hurt her child. She then asks Perdida to tells her what actually happened as she won't stop helping her. Perdida tells, that she knows as she's possessed by the demon inside of her. The demon possessed Perdida proceeds to pin Alex to the ground. Alex with the help of the Witchblade tries to find the hex mark on her, but the demon tells her, that it is actually inside of her. The demon tells Alex, that he never releases his victims until it drives them into the ground. It then tells, that the demon is the wave of the black tide that will engulf the world as shadowy energy forms around it. Alex then grabs a chair and knocks Perdida out.\nOfficers then rush into the room, as Perdida is terrified that the demon possessed her again. The officers apologise for taking so long to get here as there was a powers surge, which locked all the electronic locks and turned off the cameras. Officers then says that if she needs somebody to sign an affidavit for her insurance, he will do it no problem. Alex rejects this offer and then proceeds to leave. She then goes to an abandoned factory where Ash lives. As Ash returns home, Alex asks him to teach her how to perform an exorcism.\nAlex trains with Ash as she recalls the past events. Although she is a formidable fighter, Ash notes, that her skills won't be enough when facing against supernatural beings. Frustrated, Alex asks Ash to teach her how to use the Witchblade, but he answers, that he can't explain something as elemental as the snow.\nLater, Alex meets with Debbie at the office of District Attorney. Debbie reveals, that Victoria Roseland requested a search warrant for Alex's electronic records, which angers her. She suggests Alex to call a lawyer, but Underwood rejects this idea. Alex then returns to the home of Perdida Duncan. She notices the house surrounded by black, energy tentacles. Alex then sees a ghost of Perdida's daughter. Seeing this, Alex decides to follow the ghost. The ghost leads her to the end of a pier. As Alex approaches the ghost, the wooden boards underneath her, break and she falls into the cold water down below. When Alex begins to sink, black tentacles surround her. Before they can drown her, Alex uses the Witchblade to destroy them.\nAfter nearly dying again, Alex decides to meet with Majil and get some answers about who she is fighting. Majil takes the book, which he stole from a mad professor at Oxford, who taught them about ancient civilizations. The book tells, that in the beginning of civilization, the word was darkness and chaos. A demon warlord rose, the worst of its kind. In order to defeat him, thirteen brave women, armed with thirteen powerful artifacts, one of them being the Wichblade, rose to stop him. After the demon was defeated, the artifacts disappeared, although they would reappear when things were chaotic and horrible. After the second world war, the Witchblade vanished and nobody knows who took it.\nMajil then stops reading the book as he notices Alex seeing something. Alex tells Majil to take her phone and call the number for Ash as she rushes after the ghost girl. The girl takes her to a church. When Alex enters it, she falls through the floor, where she's confronted by Perdida herself. The demon inside of Perdida, then proceeds to possess Alex. As Perdida regains her senses, now free of the demons influence, she asks Alex if she's okay. Alex tells her to keep away from her, while she can still fight. Majil then tracks down Alex, finding her sitting on the floor in the church in some kind of trance. He decides to call Ash for help as Perdida explains, that she remembers talking with Alex in her home a few days earlier and then nothing else.\nMeanwhile, Alex remembers her childhood, when she hurt her knee. Johnny Meyers, Alex neighbor who she felt affection towards, helps her by tying a red band over her wounded knee. She then recalls how she got imprisoned in an attic on her way home, after watching movies with Johnny. Alex then recognises the place she is in as the demon taunts her. This only fills Alex with determination to get out as she breaks her chains. Alex then confronts the demon inhabiting her, as it forms in front of her.\nAlex runs through the woods, remembering the time she was kidnapped and managed to escape. She's then confronted by Perdida's demon taken the form of Johnny. The demon proceeds to grab her by the throat, telling Alex, that she's afraid of the Witchblade. The demon is the set on fire by the Witchblade, but doesn't seemed to be fazed by this. It then slaps Alex for burning it. The demon then reveals its plans to take over Alex body and then use it to kill all her friends. Suddenly the demon begins to freeze. Realizing what's happening, Perdida's demon screams at someone, saying that Alex belongs to it as it got to her first. The demon then breaks apart into snow.\nBlake Grooves demon, taking the form of Johnny, approaches Alex and helps her to get up on her feet. Alex questions why the demons keep to take the form of Johnny and the demon guesses that whoever this kid is, he's worn some deep grooves in her subconscious. She then notices the arm on its hand, realizing, that its Blake's demon. Alex then asks why did it helped her and the demon answers that it needed somewhere it could talk and actually make her listen. The demon then gives Alex an offer to leave its city and the demon will let her and her friends live. It continues by saying, that there are plenty of other places where Witchblade could do its work. Alex then asks, what happens if she refuses. Blake's demon tells her, that he will kill all her loved ones and Alex herself. After hearing this threat, Alex claims that she will kill it, but the demon doesn't believe this happening as she couldn't kill even a minor one like Perdida's demon.\nAlex then rejects his offer and the two fall from the bridge into the water. As Alex sinks to the bottom, the demon tells her, that it will see her in the light world. Alex then wakes up, surrounded by her friends. Debbie decides to call to the police, but Ash, Majil and Perdida doesn't let her. While walking down back to home, Debbie tries to wrap her head about the news, that demons are real. When they enter Alex's apartment, Debbie is surprised to see the entire wall filled with maps and clippings of Blake's old cases and places he visited. As Alex doesn't trust Detective Roseland and her partner, she decided to do her own investigation. She then goes to take a shower.\nAt night, Alex sneaks out of her apartment, leaving Debbie sleeping on the sofa. She then begins to follow Detective Barrows around New York. When she enters a club following Barrows, a women stops her, telling her that she can't be here as \"they\" will kill her. Sensing danger, the Witchblade then conjures multiple tentacles, which wrap around the women's arm. Alex answers, that she will be fine and she can also help the women as she works with district attorney. The women tells Alex, that the men she's working for have taken all her belonging and marked her with a hex mark.\nAlex then goes deeper into the club, finding Detective Barrows talking with a mobster, Frank Leonetti. Frank expresses his displeasure with the girls, Barrows has given him as they are all drug addicts. He then warns Barrows, that he better give him a raise, otherwise his guy at the port forgets to be on duty and law enforcements find out that his containers are filled with hookers instead of stereos. Barrows then proceeds to take Frank's drink from his hands and tells him not to threaten them, unless he wants to end up like his buddy Blake Groves. Frank is confused as he heard that his wife killed him, but Barrows tells him that it wasn't the wife who killed him.\nAs Alex leaves the club, she runs into Victoria Roseland, whose been following her. Alex reassures her, that she didn't killed Blake and the detective should instead look into her partners activities. Roseland reveals that she has looked into Alex past and knows what she has been through. Detective then adds, that she's well aware about how much corrupted is the system she's working in, but Roseland doing the best she can. Alex then leaves and tracks down Barrows to Crown Heights in Brooklyn. Leonetti with his guards, watch as Barrows brings a new shipment of women. Meanwhile, Alex receives a call from Debbie, but doesn't answer it. As Barrows gets out of the truck, he asks if Leonetti didn't bring any additional backup. Leonetti questions him, why would he need backup to wrangle five hookers on drugs. When one of his men open the truck, he's immediately shot. Barrows, accompanied by his colleague, open fire on Leonetti. During the ensuing firefight, Leonetti and his men are killed.\nHaving been wounded, Barrows colleague asks him to call the ambulance. Barrows instead shoots him, saying that there can't be no witnesses. He then approaches the truck, preparing to kill the women inside. Seeing this, Alex jumps into action. Enveloped in the Witchblade armor, Alex jumps in front of the women and catches the bullet from Barrows gun with her bare hand. Alex then tells him, that this city is not there's anymore. She then tells that every last one with Barrows mark, must leave the city as their time in her city is up.\nAfter saving the women from death, Alex brings them to a hospital. Soon after the doctor informs about the condition of the five women. He tells Alex that she did a good deed and the cops want have a talk with her. Alex instead notices, that her phone shows the time of Columbia and realizes that she's late for a meeting.\nAlex goes to a library where she meets withMs. Meyers, Johnny's mother. She tells Alex, that she surprised she's keeps coming here every year. Alex phone begins to ring and Johnny's mother tells her to go as her son wouldn't want them sitting in a church neither of us believe in feeling sorry for him. Alex promises she will see her next year.\nThe phone ringing turns out be a message from Ash with words \"LOFT\". When Alex enters Ash's loft, she finds it trashed and Ash himself missing. Realizing that it was most likely the work of the demon, she calls Debbie and Majil to come here. Debbie asks why did the demon took Ash instead of Alex herself. Alex explains that because she ruined its plans for this city, the demon wants her to suffer. Having no leads to follow, Debbie suggests to wait until the demon contacts them himself. As they wait for the call, Alex notices Roseland waiting outside in the car. The three then find multiple pictures of Ash in different identities and ages.\nShe then receives a video call from unknown number and Alex tells Debbie and Majil to get out of the range of the camera. When Alex accepts the call, she sees Ash beaten up and tied to a chair. The demon, now inhabiting Detective Barrows body, warns Alex, that this time he went after a hard target, but next time, it could be Debbie or her dad. Ash then tells Alex to not listen to the demon and don't try to come for him. The demon then proceeds to punch Ash and tells Alex to come alone and give up herself and then maybe it will consider sparing her friends.\nAlex then approaches Detective Roseland and tells her to reveal Barrows location. She also asks, why is Roseland protecting him. Roseland explains, that eight years ago, she worked in Narcotics. During one of the raids, a dealer rigged a claymore inside his apartment door. The explosion killed her partner and took out her leg. Roseland then had to fight to stay in the department because of her disability. She then took the only desk job she could get. After hearing this, Alex tells Roseland, that she can't give her answers about Blake Groves or any of it. But they can help each other by saving Ash from Barrows. Roseland then reveals, that Barrows owns a closed down restaurant out in Brighton Beach and drives Alex to it.\nAt the Brighton Beach, Alex decides to not wait for SWAT, much to Roseland's objections. Inside the restaurant, she finds Ash and Barrows. She then tells the demon to talk with her directly. The demon then reveals his true form as Frank Leonetti, which confuses Barrows as he remembers killing him. The demon explains, that through Frank, it was able to pull the strings from the shadows. Alex then mocks the demon and confronts it in her mind. The demon tells her, that it has thousands of bodies around the city and destroying one won't make any difference. Alex explains, that because the demon created this body, destroying it will destroy demon himself.\nDemon then mocks Alex, noticing, that the memory they're inside is about Johnny. It tells her, that although Alex wears the artifact, she's still human and humans will always be weak. Alex tells it, that Johnny's death made her what she is today and sent her to the spot where she became the Witchblade. She then envelopes herself in the armor of the Witchblade and attacks the demon. The demon claims, that it will never be destroyed and its power is beyond anything she will ever see again. Alex then strikes the demon with an energy whip, destroying it. Roseland then comes into the restaurant and arrests Barrows, as his tattoo disappears.\nAlex together with Ash then leave the restaurant. As they walk down by the river, Alex reveals that she knows that Ash lied to her about himself. Ash tells Alex, that shouldn't do this alone and he can still help her. Alex doesn't listen to him and tells Ash to leave. Ash complies, gets into a car and leaves. She then calls Debbie to pick her up. Debbie together with Majil, drops Alex at her apartment. When Alex enters her apartment, she finds Johnny sitting on the couch, much to her shock.\nThree months later, Alex travels to Hunts Point after Majil tips her about someone killing homeless men there. Alex then stops a demon from killing a lone homeless man. She tells the homeless man to run as more demons come after her.\nAfter taking down the demons, Alex returns to Perdida Duncan's house, where she attacks the demon inhabiting it. The demon manages to escape after wounding Alex. Although the Witchblade urges her to go after it as he will bring more of his kind, Alex refuses because of her wound. The Witchblade explains, that they're meant to be fearless warriors who do not retreat until every last enemy lies dead. Alex counters this by saying that her body had enough for this night. She then calls Majil, informing him that his guess about someone killing homeless men in Hunts Point was right.\nElsewhere, Majil keeps watch over Johnny under request of Alex. Majil then informs her, that feds have entered the hotel, Johnny is staying and he goes to check whats happening. Meanwhile, Alex remembers how three months ago she find out about Johnny's sudden reappearance. Out no where, Alex is shot by the woman whose been following her. Alex then falls down the stairs leading to the metro subway. The woman turns out to be Maggie an assassin working for NGEN. As Alex hides in the metro subway, the Maggie tells her to come out as she knows, that the Witchblade can't make her invisible. She also reveals to be using special fragmentation rounds, specially made to neutralize her tricks. Then Alex notices an oncoming train and decides to jump to the other side of the tracks. Although she succeeds, Maggie hits her in the shoulder.\nAt Majil's apartment, Majil checks Alex strange wound, which he points out to her. Alex then asks, what happened to Johnny. Majil explains, that Johnny disappeared as feds entered the hotel, which frustrates Alex. He then asks why Alex hasn't asked Debbie and Detective Roseland for help. Alex explains, that Roseland told her to never involve her again in these things and Debbie doesn't know about Johnny. She then asks Majil to inspect the bullet. Debbie would want to get answers from Johnny who is already spooked enough. As Majil inspects the bullet, he concludes that is made out of silver, coated with some other material. He decides to keep the bullet and see if he can find anything else about it.\nMeanwhile, Alex returns home, when she notices her scratched mailbox. She decides to enter her apartment through fire escape, where she's confronted by Maggie. Alex figures, that scratching her mailbox was to lure her out here. Maggie then reveals, her knowledge about the Witchblade, particularly the fact, that as Alex energy runs out, its harder to use the artifact. Alex confirms this, but adds that she doesn't need the Witchblade when facing against somebody human. She then proceeds to disarm Maggie and punch her to the face. Maggie tells her, that she made big assumption about her being a human. The two women then fight with Maggie managing to knock her to the ground. The Witchblade then extends a tendril, which hurts Maggie's hand, letting Alex to kick her in the face. Maggie then begins to chant some kind of spell, paralyzing Alex and scaring the Witchblade.\nSuddenly, Maggie stops the chant as Johnny faces her. Maggie pulls out a knife and stabs him in the stomach. Johnny counter attacks by forcing Maggie to drop her knife and then knocking her out. Before he can kill her, Alex stops him, saying that they need to question her first. Johnny then takes a stranger canister and stabs himself in the neck with a needle, filled with unknown substance, telling Alex that he will be okay. Alex then asks him what is going on here. He tells her to call police for Maggie as Johnny explains, that she works for somebody who wants the Witchblade and this is just the start of what they're willing to do to get it.\nIn Alex apartment, Alex asks Johnny to explain what he said earlier. Johnny refuses as it will only waste time and Maggie will soon be released from custody by her employers. Johnny tries to assure her, that he's on her side and is trying to protect her from harm. He then Alex to pack her bags and go with him, but she refuses, until he explains about what happened to him. Johnny tells Alex, that once they're safe, he will tell her everything he knows. Although Johnny suggests to go to his safehouse, Alex instead decides to go to Majil. She also adds, that if he's this worried, she has a cop they can trust. Johnny tells her that no cops should be involved as Maggie's employers already gotten to her.\nDebbie is preparing for a court case, when Alex visits her. She reveals, that Johnny has come back, but Debbie doesn't believe her. Alex then decides to prove to her that he is alive by taking her to him. As they reach Majil's apartment, they find Johnny sitting on a couch. Debbie is frustrated that Alex has kept secret from her and asks who is trying to kill her. Alex answers that she doesn't know.\nAt the Majil's apartment, Majil brings food and Debbie presses Johnny for answers. Johnny tells them, that after getting trapped in the truck from which Alex was thrown clear, he died. He then woke up in a secret hospital, where he was given a chance to be submitted to more radical procedures, which brought him back to life. Johnny accepted the offer and went through at least twenty surgeries. He was given artificial skin grafts, genetic therapy to accelerate his own cell growth and more drugs to reactivate his nerve endings. After the procedure, Johnny thought that he will let go after studying him.\nThe doctors then revealed that he belonged to them now. Johnny and all other successful subjects were taken to the main facility. There he learned that his loved ones, didn't knew about him being alive. In the facility, Johnny was given performance enhancer that give them more strength for combat and kept the genetic alterations they made from rolling back. The enhance turns out be addictive in order to keep the subjects under their control. Johnny did what he was asked for four years, until he was reassigned to their R&D division, where he saw Alex's picture. He then stockpiled enough of the drugs to get out of there and detox himself. Although Johnny knew he couldn't hide forever, he could try protect Alex from harm.\nWhen Alex asks as to who he's supposed to protect her, Johnny tells that \"they\" are NGEN, global biotech company. Their CEO is obsessed with artifacts as her father sunk the entire family fortune into finding the Witchblade and their did, but then they lost it. Majil then informs the group, that the two men in suits seen entering the hotel are standing outside in the street. Johnny decides to leave, but Alex stops him from doing this. Instead she goes down to confront them. Enveloped in the Witchblade armor, Alex attacks one of the suits. The man tries to shoot her, but is smacked into a wall. She then tells the man to bring a message to his employers, that she doesn't appreciate them trying to kill her and they should leave her alone, while they still can. The man tells Alex that they goal isn't to kill her as she kicks him in the face, knocking him out.\nAlex is a survivor at heart, having gone through various trauma's through out her life. This include being kidnapped and imprisoned, losing her boyfriend and nearly dieing on few occurrences. Having survived this calamities, Alex decides to help others who happened to go through similar things by becoming Witness Aid Service Unit investigator.\nAlex in her Witchblade armor.\nAlex Underwood/Gallery"

        "url": "https://witchblade.fandom.com/wiki/Maria",
        "content": "MariaOld LookNew LookBiographical InformationGender:FemaleStatus:Deceased\n\nMariais part of the second generation ofNeogenesisters created byTatsuoki Furumizuand was the first to be equipped with a DualCloneblade. She's the main antagonist in the final quarter of the anime adaptation of Witchblade.\nMaria is first seen in combat training alongside her other second-generation Neogene sisters (created by Tatsuoki Furumizu using his genetic code combined with that of 1st generation neogenes). During combat training, she goes overboard on her level of violence and beats her sparring partner to death, with her supervisor Rie Nishida remarking that this is the fifth time that she has done this.\nWhen she visits Furumizu to thank him for everything he’s done for her, Nora arrives in the room and begins talking about their work, which infuriates Maria, who finds both of their behaviors rude. Resultantly, Furumizu orders Nora to take Maria shopping for toys to calm her down. When Maria sees a parent who won’t let buy her daughter a stuffed animal toy, she pushes the woman down the stairs in the store, and almost injures the girl by accident. Nora then takes Maria away and reprimands her strongly, telling her that she will inform Rie Nishida that she (Maria) is not ready for the outside world yet, and shouldn’t be let out yet. In retaliation, Maria tries to punch Nora, who grabs an twists her fist, visibly hurting Maria, who starts on a childish temper tantrum in which she tells Nora, “I hope you die.”\nMaria is later seen refusing to study for her school work, and being very childish about it, because with her IQ of 200, she sees it as unnecessary. When Furumizu offers an incentive to study, Maria demands to see her mother. Furumizu tells Maria to devote herself to her studies, and once she is able to wield the specially powerful Dual Cloneblade they have created, he will tell her everything there is to know about her mother.\nThis pushes Maria to train and study exceptionally hard, so when she is denied access to the Cloneblade a few weeks later due to it being unfinished, she had a tantrum alone in her room, and later began talking to her toys about her fantasies about how life would be if she lived with her mother (who she has never met due to living her whole life in a medical laboratory facility).\nWeeks later, Maria is finally given the Dual Cloneblade and is revealed to be fully compatible, and receives its power. Resultantly, Furumizu reveals to her that her mother isReina Soho.\nWhen she visits Reina and discovers that she already has a daughter named Rihoko and that she (Reina) does not really love Maria, only fears her, Maria can’t cope with the concept of not being loved and cared for by her mother, she snaps, believing that the only way to her mother’s heart is to replace Rihoko in it. Resultantly, she tries to kill Rihoko, but Reina stops her, and the two engage in a violent confrontation that concludes with Maria killing her mother.\nIt is later revealed that Furumizu has been using Maria as the “perfect mother” to create a new, “true” body for Furumizu in his “next life”, as tells her (believing her to be asleep), which visibly distresses Maria. After he leaves, Maria realises that the Neogenes that Furumizu created are superior to him and to humanity due to their Cloneblade potential, and declares that they are not monsters, but “chosen ones.”\nThe next day in combat training, she easily defeats her opponent Oui, but does not go overboard with her anger as she has before, and offers her opponent advice on how to defeat her in the future. Furumizu believes that they should advance to the next generation in creating his “perfect humanity” as a result of Maria’s increased maturity.\nHowever, Maria has no intention of being a part of Furumizu's plot, as she views him as “Nothing more than a pathetic, selfish old man”, and that “all he has is power. The power to get whatever he wants.” The next day, Nishida and Furumizu have used her DNA to begin work on their “perfect human”, and when Maria comes into the lab to visit him, he is initially congratulatory and ask what she wants, to which Maria replies “There is one thing… YOUR POWER!”, before stabbing Furumizu through the chest, while Nishida watches in horror. Maria then uses her hair as a weapon in a similar fashion to Nora by manipulating it to pierce the bodies of all of the nurses present, killing all of them instantly.\nFurumizu, still alive, is then told by Nishida that she too had betrayed him, as the perfect humanity he desired could never be achieved with his genes. Thus, she had scrapped his genes from the Neogene project. Outraged by this, Furumizu angrily demands that the program be changed, but he is then fatally stabbed in the spine by Maria who calls him pathetic. She then tells Nishida not to go anywhere, as she may still be of use (with Nishida struggling to contain her joy at the ferocity and power wielded by her creation).\nMaria then sent Aoi to oversee a combat contest between all of the Neogene sisters, so that the victor could help her find and take control of the Witchblade, unaware that Nishida secretly desires the Witchblade for herself and has formed a secret alliance with Mado from Doji Group Industries. The winner of Maria’s contest is named Asami.\nLater, when Doji’s 3,800 malfunctioning iWeapons attack Tokyo while Maria is searching for the Witchblade, Maria, Aoi and Asagi enter Cloneblade form to kill as many iWeapons as possible. When they locate the Witchblade, Asagi points out to Maria that power is only a means, not an end, and that Maria doesn’t actually have an ultimate goal after she gets the Witchblade.\nWhile Masane, wielding the Witchblade, is fighting the iWeapons, Maria, Aoi and Asagi attack her using their Cloneblade powers, and when they seem to have the upper hand Masane surprisingly slashes Maria across the belly. This causes Aoi to go into an all-out rage and violently attack Masane with intense ferocity, only for Masane to stab her through the chest, killing her. When Asagi reprimands Maria for having no real end goal, Maria kills her by turning her finger nails into wires, and blasting them through Asagi’s head and torso.\nWhile duelling Maria, Masane senses that Rihoko’s life is in danger and lets out a blast of energy to attract all of the iWeapons towards her and Maria. During the fight on Tokyo Tower, Maria meets her demise while either fantasizing despairingly about her mother. In her final moments, she asks either the hallucination or ghost of her mother if \"she still loved her\". Maria barely has the chance to finish her sentence as she turns to crystal dust.\nMaria undergoes many changes throughout the series. She starts out as a hyper, mentally unstable adolescent with an extreme inferiority complex. This is apparent in Maria's many tantrums, demand for attention, childish remarks, compulsive actions, spiteful actions and very simple minded understanding of the world. This is seen in her remarks on how people either \"hate\" her or \"like\" her due to them attempting to scold or discipline her for her behaviors. This is seen whereRie Nishidaattempted numerous times to teach her self-control during training to avoid killing the other sisters and immediately deemed that she \"hates\" her due to not understanding or refusing to understand or learn the error of her actions. Maria was also shown to be prone to tantrums and was shown to frequently throw angry fits and verbally screaming and irrationally blaming anyone when things don't go her way.\nMaria is also shown to be extremely amoral and childish in regards to the lives of others, this is seen where she had little to no guilt for having killed five of her other sisters and showed no guilt for her actions. Maria simply deemed it to be surprising how easy it was to killed them.\nThese violent, psychotic traits are the obvious results of her life underTatsuoki FurumizuandRie Nishida, as both never truly put too much effort in being appropriate role models for her and their constant pampering and enabling of her behavior and actions, no matter how violent or destructive, inevitably lead to her becoming completely spoiled and detached from actually being able to empathize with other people. As seen where bothReinaandMasaneimmediately analyzed that Maria had no boundaries, common sense or self-control that made her all the more dangerous and unpredictable both to herself and others.\nWhile extremely strong and dangerous, she is little more than an insecure child, desperate for attention and a mother to call her own. This is first seen where she displayed subconscious jealousy at a normal mother and daughter's relationship and impulsively attacked them due to her acting on her emotions without really realizing the reason for her feelings.\nThis in turn shows how deeply Maria desires a mother, with her having been shown to be in extreme joy when she was promised information on her genetic mother. And later excitedly went out and snuck away from the training facility to meet her due to innocently believing that since she was her mother she \"belonged\" to her and should be by her side. Later after actually meeting her and shockingly seeing that her she had sister, Maria fell into a deep shock due to the first time in her spoiled pampered life, felt a sense of jealousy and rage realizing that she did not solely have her mother's love, albeit completely subconsciously since Rie and her Grandfather's constant sheltering and pampering never made her feel jealousy. This jealousy is evident by her constant dehumanizing of Rihoko by referring her to an \"it\" over and over.\nLater upon seeing the obvious care and protectiveness Reina had for Rihoko and realizing that her mother didn't even know she existed prior to her just barging into her house, Maria went into a murderous rage because Reina did not express the feelings and reactions Maria thought her mother would have upon meeting her and their meeting not being what she had expected it to be.\nThis later caused her to enter into a homicidal rage in order to kill Rihoko and have Reina to herself. However upon seeing how her mother actively protected Rihoko, Maria fell into an even deeper rage due to her mother \"hating\" her too. Later after successfully inflicting killing wounds to Reina, Maria was initially uncaring due to, again, being too easy to kill Reina. Reina defiantly trying to stop her to protect Rihoko and her successfully injuring her, Maria fell into further emotional and physical trauma due to being injured for the first time in her life and at the hands of her own mother.\nAfter killing Reina in a rage and realizing that she never had any maternal feelings for her or knew of her existence, Maria's personality becomes almost catatonic, having shown to have become very quiet and her previous childishness and selfishness was no longer evident.\nLater, upon the true revelations of what her Grandfather's plans for her were and her now developing deep disgust and hatred for him, Maria had soon begun adopting a more mature and controlled behavior completely different from her previous childishness and bratiness. She also changes her appearance to match the deceased Reina's due to her unconscious/subconscious yearning/guilt for killing her.\nAfter hearing of Furumizu's plans to use her as a surrogate mother for his \"perfect\" clone, her disgust transforms her into a megalomaniacal psychopath who seeks power at all costs. She kills Furumizu and seizes control of the NSWF. She pledges to transform the NSWF into an army that will secure power for herself as well as the Neogene \"chosen ones\" and finally obtain everything she \"desires.\"\nIn truth, however, Maria is the leader of the organization in name only. With no clear goal other than to obtain power at all costs, Maria becomes even more secretive and reclusive than her late \"father\". With the exception ofAoi, Cloneblades such as Asagi view her as an insecure child trying to \"act tough\". As Maria drifts aimlessly, Nishida effectively runs the entire organization and continues to use its resources to hunt for the Witchblade.\nMaria's Cloneblade form.\nMaria was shown to posses several enhanced physical abilities due to her being a second generationNeogene."

She acts calmly, but without any interest in her role, a behavior reflected in her physical appearance as well, often questioning for what or who Maria is acting, and what she really wants, which often earns a scolding from Aoi. For this very reason, Maria kills her by impaling her. Asagi is the only Cloneblade Sister in the entire anime that doesn't fight (she does fight some X-Cons, but this isn't shown).\nAsagi is shown to have a bored, lazy and somewhat apathetic personality, as seen where she typically has a bored expression in her face in a majority of the time and rarely makes a big fuss whenever something happens and tends to take most things as either a bother or with complete disinterest. This is seen where she showed no outside reaction to learning of \"Grandfather's\" death andMariarunning the organization and obediently followed her orders.\nHowever, despite her largely bored and apathetic disposition, Asagi is shown to be surprisingly inquisitive, intelligent and insightful when something gains her interest. This is seen where she was curious to Maria's reason and her endgame for trying to obtain \"power\" and understood that by the end of the day, \"power\" was just a \"means\" to get to the \"ends\" and was nothing unless someone had a goal to accomplish with it, something that later made Maria question her goals. Asagi was also able to easily get a good impression of Maria's personality from their first meeting, having accurately figured out that in truth, Maria's overall personality and psychological mentality was still equivalent to a \"spoiled little kid\" and that she was only pretending to be an adult.\nDuring her battle to retrieve the Witchblade for Maria, she was able to tell thatMasanewas also at the end of her rope and was equally as \"empty\" as the her fellow Neogenes when it came to battling.\nOther than that, Asagi was also shown to possess the common bloodlust and desire to fight common to Cloneblade wielders and greatly enjoyed smashing and breaking things."

        "content": "Witchblade (Artifact)Biographical InformationAlias:DigitabulumThe BalanceRace:Primordial BeingGender:MaleStatus:AliveCharacter InformationAffiliation:The Darkness (father)The Angelus (mother)Hope Pezzini (half-sister via Sara Pezzini)Real World InformationFirst Appearance:Witchblade Issue 1\nTheWitchbladeis a conscious, intelligent, and ancient weapon with supernatural origins. It is one of13 mystical artifacts, of which twelve have been revealed:the Witchblade, the Angelus, the Darkness, the Ember Stone, the Glacier Stone, the Rapture, the Blood Sword, the Spear of Destiny, the Coin of Solomon, the Heart Stone, Pandora's Box, and the Wheel of Shadows.\nIt is the offspring of the universe's two opposing aspects, the Darkness and the Angelus (Light). The Witchblade is a male aspect created to act as a balance, which must have a female as a host, but has not spoken aloud as of yet.\nThe Witchblade is the offspring of the universe's two primal forces, the Angelus and the Darkness. To avert mutual destruction, a truce was struck. The Angelus and the Darkness consummated and, in so doing, conceived the Witchblade, creating peace and balance between them.\nThe Witchblade was discovered in modern times in Greece byKenneth Irons, but before he found it, it had many wielders. When not in use, it can look like an ornate, jewel encrusted, right-handed gauntlet. When wielded by an unworthy user, that person will lose their arm. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the host, who can hear the Witchblade. When used, it expands across the body of the wielder, often shredding clothes and covering the body like armour. The amount and coverage of the armour depends on the level of the threat.\nFor example, when facing mortals, it will usually generate less armor than when facing a demon of Hell. This armor can produce extensions of itself that can form swords, other stabbing weapons, hooks, chains, shields and wings, enabling the wielder to fly. It may also become temperamental if the wielder chooses not to use it. When wielded, it can shoot energy blasts from the hand or sword, fire projectile darts, and whip-like grapples to attack or climb structures. The Witchblade is also an excellent lock pick, and can heal wounds, even mortal ones. The Witchblade can reanimate the dead, empathically show the wielder scenes of great trauma, and allow the wielder to relive experiences from past wielders in the form of dreams.\nFollowing the events in theFirst Bornmini-series, the Witchblade was split into two parts. One half belongs to Dani while Sara has reclaimed the other half. However, the Witchblade, originally being the balance between the forces of Darkness and Light, it was revealed in the recentWar of the Switchbladesaga/arc that each half of the Witchblade represented one of the two primal forces: Sara having the Darkness one and Dani the Angelus. This led to changes in the personality of the characters, especially Sara. Encouraged by the leaderless Angelus Warriors and the mysterious Tau'ma, both wielders eventually ended up in all-out war for the complete control of the Witchblade, which concluded with Sara victorious and once again in control of the full Witchblade. She now possesses the full Witchblade, as Dani is now the host for the Angelus.\nThe Witchblade is said to possess a male personality, with several of its characteristics involving the shredding of its wielders' clothing in the generation of protective and revealing armor. The Witchblade is able to pick locks and will become temperamental in cases where its wielders prefer not to use it.\nIn the live-action series, the Witchblade possesses many of the same powers as its comic book counterpart, but manifests differently. In this case, it assumes the form of a metal gauntlet with a red gem that resembles an eye. It has gone by several names across different cultures, including Digitabulum Magae (Latin for \"The Witch's Finger\").\nWhen in use, the Witchblade could produce a blade from the wrist end of the gauntlet form, was durable enough to withstand bullets, and transform into a pata (a sword blade connected to a gauntlet). Towards the end of the first season, including the pilot film, the Witchblade could produce a full suit of armor to cover the wielder's body, but rather than appearing organic like in the comics, the armor resembled the kind worn by medieval-era knights.\nIn at leastone episode, the Witchblade demonstrated organic features, but only when its host was undergoing the Periculum, a trial to determine if she was worthy of the Witchblade, and upon completing the trial, it returned to its bracelet form.\nIn two other episodes, the Witchblade demonstrated the ability to transform itself into a transitional stage between its bracelet form and a form resembling knuckles, enabling the wielder to punch people without harming themselves.\nAccording to Kenneth Irons in the series' pilot film, the Witchblade possesses many powers. Among them was the ability to enable the wielder to win people's hearts. This implies the wielder possessing the ability to win the trust of those around her.\nAccording to Ian Nottingham in the last episode of the series, who likely learned of it from Irons, the Witchblade will not and can not be used to kill anyone that has wielded it before, being only capable of harming them.\nAccording to Sara in the last episode, the Witchblade is a state of the mind and the heart. She also implied that the Witchblade can be wielded by anyone if it were ever rendered vulnerable and therefore accessible in one of its weapon forms.\nThe Witchblade is sentient and responds to the bearer's will, as well as attempting to impose its own.\nIn reverse chronological order (fictional chronology, not publication dates) save non-canon and alternate realities:\nOther identified wearers include Cathain, who is remembered as an Irish Celtic war goddess by history in the live action TV series of the Witchblade. Cathain is connected to the historical Irish Celtic King, Conchobar.\nAlternate Reality\nNon-Canon\nIn reverse chronological order:\nThe Witchblade that was found by Alex Underwood is a different one than the one we know of. The Witchblade appeared to Alex after she was fatally surprised by the husband of a client. The Witchblade healed Alex of her wounds and bonded with her. Here, the Witchblade in idle mode is a metallic wristband instead of a bracelet.\nIn the 2024 reboot, the Witchblade is not a gauntlet but a bracelet that turns into a kind of spider. It is not directly owned byKenneth Irons (Reboot), even if it is searched for by him. In Berlin, Germany, it is in a buried box. When one of the employees finds the Witchblade, he takes possession of it directly. Chased by Irons and his men, the Witchblade changes hosts several times and ends up in the USA, New York. And from there to its new ownerSara Pezzini (Reboot).\nWitchblade (Artifact)/Gallery"

Unfortunately for him,Ben's DNA was still the default for the Omnitrix and the Ultimatrix was still linked to the same database, so Albedo only had access to Ben's current aliens, which excludedGrey Matter. Allying himself withVilgax, he agreed to help him so he could turn himself back to normal, while Vilgax could have theEarth. After Albedo asNegative Ultimate Humungousaureasily defeated Ben asHumungousaur, Vilgax threatenedGwenandKevin's lives in order to force Ben to give up the Omnitrix to him. Afterwards, Vilgax betrayed Albedo by using the Omnitrix to defeat him by turning his army ofBioidsinto thousands of Humungousaurs.\nLater, Ben activated the Omnitrix's self-destruct mechanism to force Vilgax to remove it but Vilgax refused, thinking he was bluffing and later suffered the consequences. Ben released Albedo and forced him to give him the Ultimatrix via the same threat.

Azmuth destroyed the Ultimatrix off-screen afterThe Ultimate Enemy: Part 2.[DJW 1]\n\nActive Mode\n\n\nRecharge Mode\nLike the Omnitrix, Recharge Mode is activated when the Ultimatrix runs out of time. Recharge Mode can stop automatically, once a certain period of time has passed. Recharge Mode's main purpose is to prevent the alien DNA from attaching permanently to its host, but can trigger due to power-heavy operations.[2]\n\n\nCollect Mode\nWhen DNA not present in theCodon Streamis near the Ultimatrix, it will close its main features until the DNA is scanned. When a new DNA sample is acquired and added, on occasion, the Ultimatrix can show a visual of almost every alien unlocked, including the new one.[3]\nWhen scanning DNA that was previously used or already present in the Codon Stream, the Ultimatrix identifies and matches the scanned DNA, then moves the species to an active playlist.[4]If it has seen the species before, it passively scans them, without any physical requirement from the user.[DM 3]\nThe Ultimatrix symbol shooting yellow ray\nDuring scanning, the Ultimatrix either pops out and shoots out a yellow ray from the black and yellow part or doesn't pop out but circles and then reveals a hole that shoots out a yellow ray.

Of the 47 transformations listed, Ben transformed into 35 of them on screen.\nThe following list shows all transformations unlocked during the timeframe ofUltimate Alien.

Plus, our first look at Gray's portrait and the Count makes his move!\nPreviously\nSara has a hard time to believe, that Gray is the same person from Oscar Wilde's 1891 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. To prove his identity, Gray decides to show Sara his infamous portrait. Although, Sara doesn't see how seeing his portrait will convince her of anything he said, she complies with his wishes. Upon seeing  Gray's portrait, Sara is disgusted by it.\nGray tells her, that upon seeing his portrait, just like Narcissus before him, he fell in love with his own image. He then vowed to give his very soul to stay as young and faultless as that painting. And soon after someone, somehow made him immortal as long as the portrait existed. Knowing, that he's immortal, Gray began terrorizing London. Sara asks why didn't he tried to break the curse. Gray answers, that once he tried to destroy the portrait by stabbing it with a knife, but as soon as he did this, the same wound appeared on his body.\nAs he began to die, the Count found him and brought him onto an ocean liner leaving England. After hearing this, Sara still doesn't understand why she met him. Gray explains, that the Witchblade remembers him and knows, that what he told is true. Sara is confused by this, because it would mean, that the Witchblade has its own memories. Gray then offers her a cup of coffee.\nElsewhere, the officer investigate the scene where Alice Burns confronted the Count. Both the Count and Alice are missing and the two girls, which accompanied the attacker aren't responding and just sitting emotionless. The officers decide to go to Alice apartment and check if she's there. The officers also discuss just how strange this case is. Meanwhile in her apartment, Alice puts up make up as the Count watches her.\nBack at Riverside Towers, Sara drinks a cup of coffee and tells Gray to explain everything to her or she's leaving. Gray tells her, that the ocean liner brought him and the Count to Marrakech, where they indulged in sexual pleasure and other sins. Their travels led them to Paris, where they met a waitress Bernadette, the past Witchblade wielder. Although the Count tried to invite her to meet them after work, Bernadette refused his offer. Later, as the men leave, Gray decides to comeback and apologise to the waitress for the Count's behaviour.\nGray then witnesses a couple being mugged in an alleyway, saved by Bernadette with the help of her Witchblade armor. He tells, that Bernadette taught him that he had a responsibility to his fellow man and woman. Sara then asks what happened to her and Gray answers that she died somehow. The Witchblade immediately tells Sara, that he's lying and she shouldn't trust him. After hearing this, Sara decides to leave and never see him again, much to Gray's confusion.\nAs Sara gets into the elevator, she comes to the conclusion, that everything Gray said is a lie and he's probably after the Witchblade. When she exits the elevator, she sees Alice walking with the Count. Before Sara can stop them, they get into the elevator. Back in Gray's apartment, he hears someone knocking at his door. It turns out to be Alice, wearing an attractive dress. Gray orders her to tell him, what game is she playing with him. The Count then enters the room, revealing to have brought Alice as a token of his esteem. He then offers to finally put their differences aside.To be continued..."

At the age of three, Annabella's brother William was brought to Sicily to ascend the throne and was soon crowned as the new king of Florence. Soon after, the Swamians invaded Sicily and killed William. Annabella's father, fearing for her life, brought her to theMonastery of Emanueleto haveSignor Raimondo, the head monk, watch over her. Her father sheltered her to the throne until she becomes 18 and can decide whether to take the throne or not. There, she metAmadeoand became friends with him.\nWhile riding their horse around the area around the monastery, Annabella, who just recently turned 18, tells her friend, Amadeo, how she grew up in the monastery and since birth and wanted to go out and spread her wings. She wanted more action in her life and, though having a meaningful prayerful life is one, she believes there is a need to be more active.\nThe two arrive at the monastery three hours late and are scolded by Signor Raimondo, the head monk of the Emanuele who mention's a gift from God and why they must remain sedentary to all that is happening to their world. Later that evening,Signor Bertrando, sneaks into her bedroom and attempts to rape the sleeping Annabella. Though he succeeds in ripping her clothes, he can not \"function properly\" to do the actual act. Thus just feasted in looking through her body before finding a tattoo of the royal crest, a winged-horned four legged creature. Amadeo who has heard her cries comes to her rescue and as the other monks. Amadeo punches Bertrando and the monk escapes the monastery.\nSeeing the royal mark on Annabella's body, Amadeo realises that she is the heir to throne. Annabella then explains her origins and how she doesn't want the throne. Signor Raimondo reminds her not to decide to swiftly even after what happened and tells her, that they will find Signor Bertando and persecute him. But Amadeo expresses, that he's sure Bertando is on his way to report Annabella's true origin to the Swamians.\nThree days later, the monks decide they must do everything they could to protect Annabella and decide to use the Hand of God. Annabella who was listening behind a door thought the monks are out to get her and tries to escape but only to find the monks attempting to use the Hand of God but end up having their hands destroyed. When it was Amadeo's turn to try to use the gauntlet, Annabella came to stop him as well as the rest of the monks, but the Hand of God extended itself towards her. Right before the altar, Annabella became the bearer of the Witchblade.\nThe Swamiam came to attack, but the monks are ready. Together with Annabella they defend their monastery. Although they fight bravely, the monks are quickly overwhelmed by the Emperor's soldiers. During the battle theEmperor Gualtierowas able to heavily wound Amadeo. This angered Annabella and she asked the Hand of God, for more power and lashed out by asking \"it\" to show it to her. She then shoots a beam of fire at Gualtiero.\nThis only causes Gualtiero to show his true, demonic form. Having witnesses the power of the Witchblade, Gualtiero wants it for himself and attacks Annabella. The two fight with Annabella blasting the Emperor to ashes. Annabella then went to the wounded Amadeo whom she promised to take care until he is better. Amadeo said she is the light of Sicily in their dark times and that she must go. She responded that when he is better she wanted him to join her. The two then kiss.\nAnnabella is strong willed woman, who believed that only through taking action can someone fix their problems. She yearned to explore the world and not be captive in the monastery.\nAnnabella bonding with the Witchblade."

        "content": "The Darkness, the father of the Witchblade\nTheDarknessis one of the two primal forces of the Top Cow universe, representing darkness and chaos. He was the main foe of his archenemy, theAngelus.\nThe Darkness is one of the two primal forces of the universe. A male entity of darkness which represents chaos. The Darkness is engaged in an internal war with his natural, female counterpart,the Angelus. However, he and the Angelus created a sexual truce and they became the parents ofthe Witchblade, which acts as a balance between them.\nThe Darkness chooses males as his hosts as he passes from father to son, leaving the previous host (and taking his life) as his first child is conceived, he then awakens within the current host on his 21st birthday. Darkness hosts can create anything they desire with the Darkness, even sentient beings, but anything they make will crumble to dust in the light.\nThe Darkness is quite deadly, allowing its host to manipulate the shadows/dark to call forth darkling minions to do his bidding and even survive gunshots. It can also be used to maul and feed on people. The Darkness does not function unless it is dark, but some users can also manipulate this by creating their own shadows/darkness (smoke-grenades, turning off the lights in a room, being underground, etc). But one of the most deadly powers of the Darkness is the ability to create small black holes, and as long as the Darkness' host is in the shadows, he can summon the black hole in the light.\nThe Darkness also has his own shadow realm that he can go to, where he is king. All of the Darkness' host bodies end up there after the Darkness has no further use of them. The Darkness keeps the corpses alive while they are in this realm, as they now have no souls. This shadow realm is also where the darklings go when they are killed. The Shadow Realm also has another name: Hell. The Darkness is empathically able to feed off emotions, and when he senses fear, anger, love, hate, envy, lust, or pride, it increases the Darkness' range of strength, but the Darkness doesn't need to sense strong emotions to gain strength.\nDarkness hosts can also make duplicates of itself when engaged in a situation, and can also teleport by shifting into the Darkness Realm and back, if the host has enough knowledge of The Darkness. If one of The Darkness's host body dies before The Darkness wants him to, The Darkness will put him into his shadow realm until The Darkness fixes him up. The Darkness is passed on via sex, but all Darkness hosts have created hyper-sexual, humanoid female darklings for the purpose of sexual gratification. These courtesans are capable of inducing sexual pleasure that human men cannot handle.\nJackie Estacadois the current host of the Darkness and ex-hitmanfor the Franchetti Family mob. He is a very violent and sexual man who, until gaining the powers of The Darkness, lived life in the fast lane. Of course, because of the possibility of impregnating a woman causing his own death through The Darkness (it's passed down from father to son, killing the father at the moment of conception), Jackie tries to refrain from sex, to his great frustration.\nThough Jackie lives life on the wrong side of the law and can kill without remorse, he has a set of morals he follows and always tries to protect those he cares about. Jackie joined the Mafia at age 6, after being recruited by a mafia don named Frankie \"Kill-the-children-too\" Franchetti. He was picked up at the orphanage after Frankie was prompted by a mysterious stranger named Sonatine, who told Frankie that having Jackie around would bring him tremendous power. Jackie came to the mafia life easily, losing his virginity to a female officer, during interrogation, at age 14 and killing a man for the first time at 16. He grew up, or more accurately matured, very quickly, and soon enjoyed the life of sex and violence. His actions as a hit-man caused the Italian-crime family to become the most powerful Mafia in New York, fulfilling Sonatine`s Prophecy.\nHowever, when he turned 21, his dark powers awakened and he learned of his dark inheritance. At first, this power was a blessing, allowing his job as a professional hit-man to run more smoothly and work in more novel ways. However, with this power came many enemies. Early on, Jackie spent much of his time escaping from or fighting the Angelus (who wants to kill him), and Sonatine and his Brotherhood of The Darkness (who wish to capture him and steal his powers). Eventually, Jackie chose to quit the mob, but found it easier said than done. Jackie had turned on his adoptive father, Don Frankie Franchetti, to get a clean slate and exit from his life of crime after a meeting with Batman. (Batman/Darknesscrossover)\nHowever, after Jackie's \"uncle\" Frankie kidnapped Jenny, a childhood friend of Jackie's, Frankie killed her and sent a videotape to Jackie in revenge. Jackie could not take this and called out Frenchetti's mob, leading them to an abandoned warehouse covered in gasoline. When the crew arrived to kill Estacado, Jackie threw down his lighter and blew the place, and all its occupants, to bits. (Darknessvol. 1 #40) Over the course of this series, Jackie makes uneasy alliances withSara Pezzini, the most recent user ofThe Witchblade. Jackie spent two days (or what seemed to him like 'a million years') afterward wandering around Hell, searching for Jenny, until Tom Judge came and gave him hope, a gift that allows men to exit Hell (The Rapture). (Universe#3) Jackie's body was then reconstructed by The Darkness, using genetic material from Jackie`s only remains, a tooth. (Darknessvol. 2 #1)\nJackie returned to find the Franchetti mob taken over by Frankie's cousin, Paulie. Paulie was able to discover Jackie's secret as well as a long-lost sister of Jenny's. Using this information, Paulie blackmailed Jackie into doing hits for him. Along the way, Jackie learned how to construct a gun out of The Darkness. Later, Jackie discovered the identity of the hitman following Jenny's sister, killed him, and took his revenge on Paulie as well. This led to Jackie taking control of the Franchetti family.\nSince taking control of the Franchetti family, Jackie has vastly expanded his mafia, taken on the Triads, and fought the Russian Mafia in Atlantic City. Being the Don of the Italian Mafia in New York did not last long however. In search for revenge the new Angelus once again confronts Jackie (WitchbladeFirst Born#1 - 3) and with the help of Patience the Magdalena and Witchblade wielder Danielle, Estacado manages to crush her, losing everything he had gained. He flees to Sierra Muñoz in hope of establishing a new empire there. (DarknessVol.3 #1)\nJackie Estacado is also thefatherof Hope Pezzini, Sara Pezzini's dark child. He himself could not explain it properly apart from saying that it had to with 'Darkness wanting to tip the balance'. An emanation of The Darkness entity himself confirms this to Patience (Witchblade#110) by saying that he used Jackie as raw material to settle the matter with Angelus once and for all.\nRecently, (Darkness Vol. 3 # 1-2) Jackie has established a drug cartel in Sierra Muñoz under the alias Ocaso, with a narcotic made from his own bodily fluids thanks to the help of a demented, but brilliant scientist named Professor Kirchner. With The Darkness, Jackie is able to take control of the small tropical republic, build himself an impenetrable fortress, an army and eventually, even a lover he calls 'Elle'. Most of these come at a price since the residents of Sierra Muñoz don't take very kindly to him. To express their distaste, they perform various acts of guerrilla warfare and in their struggle for liberation, they have found themselves a sponsor in their struggle - The United States.\nJackie returns to his home after a failed assassination attempt. When fully in the labyrinth, he is sexually greeted by Elle. He and Elle mate and Jackie impregnates her. He is then summoned to find one of the rebel leaders, during this he finds the American air fleet. Jackie went to fight the army head on and using The Darkness he was able to take out the entire fleet. Returning to his fortress he is betrayed by Kirchner and loses control of his power after Elle takes control of his darklings, with his darklings turning on him. Jackie was left for dead after being shot in the neck and thrown down a waterfall.\nUpon his capture he made a deal with the local rebels agreeing to rid the island of the drug. They kept him in line by strapping a vest of plastic-explosives to his waist, he then led them to his fortress were he rewrote the chemical structure of The Nightfall drug turning it into a cure for the addiction. In doing so he crossed paths with Elle and she showed Jackie that she is pregnant with his baby. Elle and Jackie begin to reconnect but she then kills the rebels, but one of the rebels (Morisol) drops the remote detonator to Jackie`s vest.\nJackie and the remaining rebels escape the fortress in a jeep. Meanwhile Kirchner has Elle sent to the lab to deliver the baby, he also discovers the remote detonator and detonates the vest killing Morisol and causing Jackie`s entire body to blow in half. Jackie (still alive) detaches his still living torso from his legs and begins to crawl away. During this time Elle gives birth to a male, darkling/human-hybrid. The child however killed Elle upon birth, grew to full maturity and killed Professor Kirchner.\nMeanwhile Jackie with one final act of will calls his dark soul (The Darkness) back into his body, allowing his body to repair itself and his powers restored. A fight between father and son ended when Jackie left the creature in the upper atmosphere just as dawn was breaking. The creature was then destroyed by the suns rays as it was completely a construct of The Darkness. After crashing to Earth following this battle, Jackie was 'broken'. He was only able to draw just enough strength to keep himself alive through a number of fights while trying to stay alive. During one such fight, he was knocked out and taken to a being known as The Sovereign, who was a being capable of inhabiting any statue bearing his likeness, who told Jackie he died for an instant after fighting his child. This separated his soul from his body, leaving him in his broken state.\nIn return for a number of assassinations, The Sovereign would reunite Jackie with The Darkness.The assassinations Jackie was sent on were meant to return to Hell evil souls, who had previously made a deal with The Sovereign to take over human bodies. After one such mission in Africa, Jackie was enticed by a beautiful woman with a red scarf, who motioned for him to follow. As he was about to follow her into a house, he was stopped by a man who claimed to have once hosted The Darkness, but had completely discarded the entity without killing him. He warned Jackie of the trap laid hundreds of years earlier, which Jackie ignored. Inside the building the woman waited, along with a Djinn which was created to kill Darkness hosts.\nEventually, Jackie understood that both the woman and the Djinn were cursed themselves, to live only to kill hosts of the dark entity. By strangling the woman, both were released. Outside, Jackie was once more confronted by the old Darkness host, who explained the entity was still completely within him, only held back by his own wish to be without The Darkness. Through a series of insults and physical attacks, Jackie once more drew on the full power of The Darkness, claiming to be sick of people who tried to mess with him. Together with the always talkative darklings, he stated his desire to return home. Attacking the building where the Sovereign held his base, Jackie found himself caught in a room flooded with artificial sunlight and a score of bodies controlled by the Sovereign.\nWith the help of the darklings biting the power lines outside, Jackie destroyed all the bodies, leaving only one man behind. Jackie, impressed with the ability of this man to stay calm where all the other mercenaries had panicked, offered him a job. Jackie quickly brought together a group of people with distinct skills for a single purpose: to destroy each and every statue that might be used by the Sovereign, effectively removing his presence from Earth. During this time, Jackie was called by Sara who suspected him of robbing a number of New York banks. During a meeting in broad daylight Sara warned Jackie to stay away from the city, not wanting to tell her daughter Hope that mommy had killed daddy.\nJackie agreed and instructed his new employees that under no circumstance were they to enter the city of New York. Jackie and histeamthen go on a world tour finding and destroying stone bodies that The Sovereign could use as hosts. One of these trips takes him to Fort Knox where a host statue is held. During the raid Jackie discovers that The Sovereign has already taken over the statue as it is radiating light. Jackie is forced to take the Sovereign-possessed statue with them he orders his team to detonate the explosives they had set earlier. Unfortunately for Jackie, he falls from the van and is left helpless as tanks and marines surround him on orders by Major White, who somehow survived the explosion back in Sierra Muñoz.\nThe embodiment of the Light and the opposing force of The Darkness,the Angelusis one of Jackie's mortal enemy. The Angelus retains the memories of all of her previous host's lives and has led many crusades against Jackie in seeking to rid the world of The Darkness.\nThe powers of the Angelus are similar to the powers of The Darkness as both have the ability to create sentient beings, both commands a host of minions to do their bidding, she has the power of flight, can conjuring weapons at well and fire bolts of light and teleport herself and other beings (as she did to the bearer of the Ember Stone).\nLike The Darkness, The Angelus does have her limits too. While The Darkness cannot function at all in the light, The Angelus can function in the dark but only for short periods of time as it completely drains her power, and turns anything she creates into dust.\nThe first modern host was the catatonic wife of Uncle Frankie, Lauren Franchetti. After she is killed the power initially possesses Velocity of Cyberforce but it is immediately driven from her body by Cyberforce. She then finds a new host in Celestine Wright until she herself is killed during the events of Broken Trinity by Jackie Estacado. The current Angelus is the former Witchblade hostDanielle Baptiste.\nAn ancient shadow race which feed on the sexual energy of human victims. The Necrobi have the ability to remove the soul from their victim`s body, trapping the body in a blue crystal structure.\nShe is Jackie and Sara's daughter. She is a hybrid of The Darkness and human.\nThe daughter of Don Frankie, and the vengeful child of the catatonic Lauren Franchetti, who watched as her father murdered her mother's lover, which caused her to go into a coma. She never liked Jackie, always calling him a bastard(he always called her a bitch), although they maintained an artificial relationship to fool Frankie. Responsible for The Angelus' return, and unsuccessfully trying to overthrow the Franchetti family, Appolonia is left in a coma after being ``infected`` with a peice of Jackie`s power and touched by The Angelus, causing the light to hurt reject her, leaving her comatose. But she is brought out of this state with a fragment from the Spear of Destiny, the Magdalena's weapon, and branches out into her own side of The Darkness herself.\nAfter being banished by The Angelus she mysteriously reappears on the anniversary of her parents' marriage. She is generally happy to see Jackie and is terrified of her mother (as she feels there is nothing remaining of her). Appolonia appears to be in league with The Angelus, setting up Jackie, but in reality betrays The Angelus when she is about to kill Magdalena & Jackie. Appolonia kills her mother with the Spear of Destiny, ending her mother's suffering. Lauren dies with tears of joy and is happy to see both Jackie and her daughter. Appolonia's current whereabouts are unknown.\nEach generation one random woman is chosen to host The Witchblade, a mystical, symbiotic entity of enormous power. This generation's host is Sara Pezzini, a New York City detective. Sara teamed up with Jackie first in the Family Ties crossover, and again later to fight the Necrobi. Sara has also hassled Jackie about his Midnight activities during the second run of the comic. She is also the mother of Jackie`s ``daughter`` Hope Pezzini. This has ignited a romantic/sexual attraction between Sara and The Darkness.\nThe Magdalena was first introduced to Top Cow inThe Darknessseries, and has appeared a few times in the comic during her reign. Descended from Mary Magdalene, the first Magdalena we are introduced to was Sister Mariella, the daughter of Sister Rosalia. Mariella was prematurely sent to battle Jackie, and since she was brought up in a twisted sect of the church, was a wild fanatic who did not know right from wrong. She was left for dead, but recovered, only to battle with the Angelus and again be left for dead. Mariella hasn't been seen since.\nAfterwards, Patience, the current Magdalena, is sent out to attack The Darkness, and Jackie mistakes her for Mariella, as does The Angelus. After explaining the situation to him, they end up teaming up against the Angelus, and Patience is possessed by her spirit. Jackie saves her, and The Angelus flees. Patience aided Jackie in defending Sara while she was in labor with their child. The baby is the offspring of The Darkness & a human, thus The Angelus saw her as a threat.\nJackie has a twin sister named Capris Castiglione. The two were separated when they were just babies. Worried about Darkness's power and influence on her other child, their mother entrust Capris to Father Brendan. He raised her in an orphanage as if she is his own daughter. Capris' destiny gets twisted when she finds her best friend Blair murdered. She discovered that Blair was used in illegal porno movies. When Father Brendan was dying, he revealed Capris's past and twin brother to her. She meets a Native American by the name of Robert Bearclaw (Ripclaw of Cyberforce) who teaches her how to use the limited Darkness powers that she inherited from her father.\nFive years later, full of hatred, Capris sought out the men responsible for her friend's death. She pretended to be stripper named Tiffany and waited for a right moment to kill them. Ripclaw followed her on the revenge trip and offered to resume training her in the use of the Darkness. When she meets her brother, Jackie Estacado, for the first time, she tells him where the Angelus is holding Frankie, and then disappears. When Jackie needed to fight Cherubs, and Ripclaw took him to the spirit world, Capris looked after their earthly bodies and kept Jenny company. She and Jackie maintain a fair relationship, that occasionally becomes romantic and even sexual.\nJackie wields the powers and abilities of the Darkness, a universal force of chaos and darkness creation. This gives him the ability to work an amazing number of effects, from greatly increasing his own strength, speed, durability, senses, healing-factor, etc., to creating sentient life (commonly in the form of Darklings, small, foul-mouthed imps that do his bidding). Jackie most commonly uses the Darkness to craft a suit of mystical, semi-organic body armor around himself, as well as creating shadowy, fanged tentacles and clawed Darklings toevisceratehis opponents. He has displayed the ability to create black-holes out of the shadows, as well as perform teleportation through shadows.\nThe limits of the Darkness' power and ability are unknown, though it does not function at all in strong light, which turns anything it creates into dust. Jackie would appear to have some limited prescience or precognition, and has, on a few occasions, seen how individuals will die. (The Darknessvol. 2, Issues #1-3)\nMore recent comics show Jackie as having the power and ability to generate permanent physical objects (such as water, and the drug known as Nightfall) as well as technically creating \"life\" in the form of one of his lovers, Elle. He is able to create these things through practice, and the guidance ofProfessor Kirchner. During this time, Jackie becomes a drug lord, and his powers and abilities evolve to form the goblin-like Darklings into larger, hulking, more malevolent forms. The palace in which he lives is also constructed from the Darkness, and changes and reforms to Jackie's will, allowing him to technically shift through space and time and get to the places he wants to go faster.\nOn top of his mystical abilities, Jackie is a top-notch mafia hitman and is a master marksman (with a preference for dual 9mm handguns) as well as being a formidable hand-to-hand fighter. He has recently displayed formidable skill with a sword. Jackie also has other abilities, including flight, chaos manipulation, night-vision, surface-scaling, shadow manipulation and shadow-energy blasts.\nThe Darkness has been around for at least a few millennia, and thus has been used by many men (being passed down from father to son). A lot of these other users can be seen in the mini-series,Tales of The Darkness.[1]In one instance, the powers of The Darkness were siphoned from Jackie by Ian Nottingham. One of the most well known users outside of Jackie has been thepirateCaptain Miguel Estacado, who was the main character of Ron Marz'sThe Darkness: Black Sails.[2]Jackie's twin sister Capris Castiglione is also a user of Darkness, the only known female user to date.\nIn the one-shot comicDarkness Infinity,[3]present-day Earth is destroyed by The Darkness, and in the distant future, an alien race discovers the remains of the planet, and a space shuttle on the moon, which, according to the shuttle's records, was in orbit of Earth when the planet was destroyed. Apparently, after Earth was destroyed, The Darkness began looking for a new host, and found the crew of the shuttle, which it possessed, until the crew killed each other.\nThe alien newcomers were the first to discover Earth, and therefore the first opportunity The Darkness had to inhabit a new host. The comic ends with The Darkness possessing the crew leaving the captain of the ship all alone, and taking off to cause destruction throughout the galaxy, as The Darkness has done for millennia, on thousands of inhabited planets.\nJackie has appeared in crossover story lines involving Lara Croft, Sara Pezzini, Jane Vasko, Clark Kent, the xenomorphs, the Predators, Eva - Daughter of Dracula, The Hulk, Bruce Wayne, Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange, and Wolverine.\nThe first two exist in a shared continuity with The Darkness. Several are non-canonical for the crossover heroes, but several of the other crossover are canonical as the events in this crossover are later referred to and have repercussions in The Darkness comic & Top Cow Universe.\n\nThe series has been collected into a series oftrade paperbacks:\nIn December 2004, Dimension Films paid an undisclosed six-figure sum to develop a possible movie based on the comic, planned for release in 2008 but has not been released yet. The comic was pitched as a similar movie toThe Crow, which was also produced by Dimension.[citation needed]\nAccording to Newsarama, Top Cow president Matt Hawkins revealed that a live-action film based on the comic is in development. Details on the project were light, with Hawkins only saying that Scott Stuber Productions (The Kingdom, The Break-Up) was attached to produce.[1]\nThe Darkness (video game)In March 2005, \"The Darkness\" was licensed by Majesco for a console game to be developed by Starbreeze Studios. 2K Games later obtained the rights to the game, and the first-person shooter was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console systems on June 25, 2007 in the United States and on June 29, 2007 in the EU (Xbox 360 only - PlayStation 3 version was released on July 20) .\nTo promote the video game a five-issue mini-series was released, with each issue chronicled a chapter of the game. In June 2007 it was collected into a Trade Paperback (ISBN 1582407975).[4]The game is mostly based on the events of the first volume of the Darkness comics, however it does alter some key elements such as having Paulie being the one that adopts Jackie.\nDuring the game, The Darkness holds true to the comics, with the same powers. Though the Darkness becomes extremely resilient, and tries to make you kill people, it is relatively docile toward the beginning of the game. By the time The Darkness realizes you are taking control it then starts to try to persuade you to stop.\nMarc Silvestri noted in an interview that a sequel to the first game is in the works.\n\nIGN news of Phil Hester ongoing Darkness Series\n\n"

Akane then wakes up from her trance, confused as to what just happened. As Akane leaves the murder scene, her partner Sam Takahashi expresses his displeasure towards her cybernetic origins. She then drives home and goes to sleep. In her dreams, Akane sees someone trying to get into her apartment. As she wakes up, she decides to have a shower. Out no where, a woman appears behind her. The woman tells Akane, she believed detective could help her, but she was wrong.\nAkane wakes up, realizing that it was just a nightmare. She then receives a call from doctor Kesato who urges her to come by his lab right away as her brain waves patterns are off the charts. Akane tells him, that it just nightmares, but the doctor reassures, that this is different. Moments later, Akane visits the doctor at the Aurora Industries. After few tests they conclude, that as she conducted her investigation, someone else breached her mind. Takahashi then comes by, telling them that there's been another murder in the Elysium Park. Doctor Kesato is not happy about Takahashi's behaviour towards Akane, but believes they eventually will find a common ground.\nWhen they reach the Elysium Park, a local cop greets them and makes a misogynistic comment aimed towards Akane. She quickly points this out, embarrassing the cop. Inside the slum, Akane connects to the murdered man. The man sees the mysterious woman, which Akane has seen before, approaching the man. The man feels remorseful for what happened to her in St. Albans as the woman kills him. The woman then speaks directly to Akane, telling her that it had to be this way, which startles the detective.\nLater in the car, Akane tells Takahashi to look up information about Saint Albans. While at first thinking it to be person, Akane corrects him, revealing that its actually a place. Takahashi finds that its an orphanage. Akane then hears the mysterious woman's voice, calling her. As this happens, she nearly loses control over the car. Moments before hitting a truck, Takahashi takes the wheel and stops the car. Akane then tells Takahashi to drive. Hours later, after a quick ride and a thorough exam at the Aurora Industries, the technicians find no damage done to Akane. Akane's artificial intelligent mainframe interface, AIMI for short, suggest her telling Takahashi about the killer entering her mind. Nakiko explains, that she first needs to get more information about this killer, before revealing her condition. She orders AIMI to not tell anything to her partner.\nAfter the medical exams, Takayashi reveals, that they have a meeting with lieutenant Seldin in the conference room as they have a theory as to what is happening to her. Takayashi then tells her that Saint Albans was local halfway house for drug-addicted runaways. Both victims were students there when a scandal broke out revolving around one father Brady Miller who molested three kids. Takayashi comes to the conclusion, that the killer will target the Miller next.\nThe two then meet lieutenant Seldin in the conference room. Seldin reveals, that Aurora Industries sought an outside contractor called Cyberdata to develop weaponry for the cyborgs they were developing. In response to Aurora's search, Cyberdata came here with a weapon they were experimenting with the Witchblade. Seldin explains, that the Witchblade chooses only notable wielders, that are female. If male tries to use the artefact, he will either lose his hand or die. In order to use the artefact, Cyberdata spent years trying to find the right fit. Some women were even fitted with cybernetic implants in a failed attempt to make the Witchblade work properly. Seldin believes, that the killer responsible for the two murders is the new wielder of the Witchblade. Before detectives leave, Seldin warns them, that the Witchblade is extremely difficult to defeat by force. The wielder must be convinced to give it up.\nLater at SIU headquarters, Takahashi reads information about Brady Miller to Akane. For molesting three children, Miller was sentenced to a twenty four years in prison. The sentence was reduced to six years for good behaviour. After leaving the prison, Miller started another halfway house in Macropolis, under a different name. Anakine then questions if one of the victims could be the killer, but Takayashi tells her, that they all live elsewhere and have alibis that checked out. He then calls Miller, warning him that he's in danger. Miller reveals his whereabouts to Takayashi. As Akane hears this, she hears mysterious woman's voice in her head, thanking her for this information.\nWhen they go to Miller's house, they find him already murdered. Takayashi ponders, that the killer somehow monitored them. Akane doesn't anything, although she blames herself for Miller's death. As Takayashi goes to question the kids, Akane connects to the now dead Miller. She sees Miller about to rape a girl, when the mysterious woman approaches him. The woman forces Miller to read her diary as she slowly kills him for molesting her, many years ago. As Miller dies, he tells the woman, that he loved her and he thought she loved him too. He then apologizes and dies. Akane then wakes up, seeing the same girl, Miller was about to rape, approaching her. Akane tells her, that she shouldn't be here, but the girl calms her down, saying, that she knows why it happened. Detective then asks if the girl knows where women went and the girl answers, that she went home.\nDetectives then go to a local arcade, which used to be Saint Albans orphanage, where Debbie Santalesa should be. Takayashi tells Akane, that when Debbie was molested by Miller, nobody believed her. When Akane searches the arcade, she finds Debbie sitting in the corner. Through Witchblade, Debbie shows Akane how she became a drug addict and a prostitute, hating the entire world for what it did to her. She then took part in the Witchblade experiment for money. As the Witchblade bonded with Debbie, she went on a mindless rampage, killing the scientists, that were experimenting on her. Moments later, she was knocked out and put into a cell. The Witchblade kept her alive and for that, Debbie trusted it. Akane tells her, that she can trust her.\nOther detectives finally notice Debbie and open fire on her. This makes her go into rage and she kills the cop that shoots her. She then nearly kills Takayashi, but is stopped by Akane. Debbie then shots a beam of fire at her and prepares to kill Akane. Through the Witchblade, Akane manages to convince Debbie, that she's being controlled by the artefact, who preys and manipulates her fears. After hearing this, Debbie casts out the Witchblade from her. Both Akane and Debbie then hug with the detective saying, that she knows how difficult is life.\nAs a cyborg, Akane struggles with her human emotions, seeing them more as a nuisance than as a useful tool. Akane's telepathic abilities let her feel the emotions of everyone around her at any time. Because of this, she feels helpless as she can do nothing to help them. Akane must also endure harsh words from her co-workers for her cybernetic origins.\nAkane connecting to a corpse."

Only a Spawn and the new wielder of the Witchblade stand between them and their victory.\nIt's nineteen-ninety-six, New York and Royale is resting on a bench in a park, wondering how will this city look like in six months time. He's resting is interrupted by a head in a box sitting near him and yelling profanities at him. The fact that the head still holds a grudge against him after eight hundred years of pain and misery, amuses Royale.\nIt's eleven-seventy-five A.D. and the cruel tyrant Lord Cardinale, the current Darkness host is met by Matthew Royale in his castle in the city of Pyreness. Cardinale points out that he never heard of him. Meanwhile, Royale has heard a lot about Lord Cardinale and his dark powers, that helped him to create an empire stretching from Flanders to the south of Spain. Cardinale interrupts Royale, telling him that he's fully aware of what he is and instead asks who his guest supposed to be. Royale answers, that he's the man who will make Cardinale truly mighty.\nLord Cardinale doesn't believe him, thinking that he already can do everything he wants, even creating a queen for himself out of the Darkness, that he named Elinor. Royale points out, that although Cardinale is truly mighty, his powers only work in the dark and its only matter of time, until his subjects realize this and overthrow him. To stop this from happening, Royale suggests Lord Cardinale to invade the otherworld that lies besides their own calledFaerie. The spells perfected by the Faerie folk and the knowledge they possess are unimaginable and someone like Cardinale could rule our world with this power. As the light in Faerie is not drawn from our sun, the Darklings would be immune to it.\nElinor then questions Royale as to what he gains from all of this. Royale answers, that he's a student of sorcery and some of the Faerie magic would fascinate him on a purely academic level, and he would relish the fact is he could study them. Although Elinor doesn't believe his answers, Lord Cardinale decides to go through with Royale's suggestion and attacks Faerie. One day later in the Otherworld of Faerie, Galinor and Torinor are enjoying the day. Suddenly, Torinor is shot in the head by an arrow. Soon after the army of Darkness attacks the kingdom and proceeds to lay siege on it. As Lord Cardinale watches the carnage, Royale warns him that because of the complicated relationship of Faerie's world to their own, the conflict he started could well spill over to Earth at any time.\nElsewhere, Medieval Spawn is riding down the road as the Darklings and Faerie fall out of a portal in front of him. Seeing the Darkling killing the Faerie folk, the Spawn attacks the Darkness creatures. Although the Darklings manage to take a hold of him, the Spawn quickly evaporates them and brakes free. Meanwhile, Lord Cardinale asks as to who that stranger was. Royale explains, that it was a young Spawn, which makes Elinor to ask if he poses a threat to them. Royale reassures them that he doesn't pose any threat to their plans.\nThat afternoon in Merrie, England, Katarina refuses to pay her bill. The taverns owner, Stalker, asks her to be reasonable as she was the one that started the conflict, which in turn damaged his tavern, hence the bill. Katarina doesn't remember starting any fights. Stalker quickly reminds her, that he insulted Vulvar the Viking and proceeded to kick the living crap out of him. Katarina points out, that it was because he made a vulgar statement about her looks. Stalker fires back, that she does this every night and this behavior is begging to take a toll on his business. As Katarina is broke and doesn't have money to pay the bill, Stalker gives her two options: either fill up a wagon with dung and drive it to Jobbie McGurk's Dung Emporium or have sex with him.\nKatarina decides to go with the first option and begins filling the wagon with dung. Stalker then asks as to how did Katarina ended up without money. She explains, that she signed on as a convoy guard with Dylan The Welsh, but in the end got lost, which in turn stopped them from reaching their destination and getting paid. Without warning, Katarina's right arm envelopes in Witchblade, which proceeds to create a burning spear just as the Darklings attack them. With the help of the Witchblade, Katarina fends off the attackers as the Medieval Spawn joins to aid her. Their combined forces prove to much for the Darklings and they proceed to run into Stalker's tavern. The Spawn in turn, completely blows it up.\nAfter this, Katarina questions if he's a sorcerer or something and how did he knew her name. The Spawn eludes the questions, when both are startled by Stalker shooting the last living Darkling with a crossbow. Stalker is unhappy with the Spawn destroying his tavern and also asks about the gauntlet on Katarina's hand. Katarina tells him, that the gauntlet just jumped on her when they started fighting and that it feels good possessing it. The Spawn then leaves, sensing that the rip between worlds is closing once again. Although Katarina objects as he didn't answered her questions, the Spawn adds that the elves of Faerie are in danger and he must go and help them. As the Spawn steps through the portal, Stalker suggests Katarina in following him, as he heard about the wealth Faerie possess. The Witchblade then begins to glow and Katarina decides to comply and the two step through the portal too.\nMeanwhile, having witnessed the battle, Lord Cardinale questions Royale as to what is Katarina wearing on her hand. Royale tells him that its a Witchblade and he believed it to be a myth. Elinor then proceeds to ask Royale if the gauntlet poses a threat to them. Royale, visibly concerned, doesn't answer.To be continued..."

This issue is the first part of\"Life After\"story arc.\nGunned down and left for dead on a New York rooftop, Alex Underwood's life should have ended there—but instead, at the moment of death, she became host to the Witchblade, a mystical artifact that grants the woman wielding it extraordinary powers. But the power comes with a heavy cost, and Alex finds herself thrust into the center of an unseen battle raging on the snowy streets of NYC. Demons are real and walking among humans, and every one of them is intent on taking out the Witchblade's newest host before she becomes too strong to kill. But the artifact chose Alex for a reason, and she's not going down without a fight.\nAlex Underwood is laying on the snow, slowly bleeding to death. A mysterious, cloaked man approaches her and Alex pleads him for help. She then releases mysterious burst of energy from her. Twenty-four hours earlier, Alex wakes up in the bedroom, having seen the same dream every night for a week. She then goes to Office of the District Attorney, where Alex and her colleague Debbie talk with their client, Myra Groves, who's been in abusive relationship with a NYPD detective Blake Groves. Myra recognizes Alex, having seen her in the news, but Alex ignores this point.\nDetectives wife is doubtful, that she has any chance to win against her husband in court. Myra then gives Alex a photo of her and Blake, so someone know just how much of a liar he is, if something happens to her. Alex asks her if Myra is okay to go back to the hotel and she reassures Underwood, that Blake isn't foolish enough to brake the restraining order in broad daylight. Debbie isn't so sure and suggests Alex to find the maid who supposedly saw Blake beating up Myra.\nAlex then wakes up in her apartment, heavily bleeding. She remembers how someone shot her. Alex then sees her entire life flash before her as the Witchblade narrates it. She then sees Myra with a bullet wound in her head, laying near her as a man stands besides them. The voice tells Alex, that this will be her future unless she saves Myra. Alex then wakes up and washes her face as she suddenly sees her reflection in the mirror with bleeding obsidian eyes. The reflection tells her, that she real and she is her. Alex then sees Myra's corpse, telling her, that she can save her.\nThe mysterious voice tells Alex, that no one can save her. She must save herself. Alex tells the voice to shut up as it warns her, that someone is coming after her and she should run. A man then jumps through the window into her apartment. He then grabs her, but under the influence of the Witchblade, Alex grabs a glass shard and drives into the attackers face. She then jumps out of her apartment into an alleyway down below. There a man approaches her and she pulls out a a spray, aiming it at him.\nThe man calms Alex down, revealing to know about what happened to her, the mysterious voice, memory loss and the attacker in her apartment. The man also knows about the visions she has saw. Alex then collapses on the ground. In her subconscious, Alex sees a familiar woman, named Meg with a half burned face. The woman explains, that this is her mind's attempt to process the trauma of the last few hours. Alex doesn't understand why is she seeing this as she has been taking her medication and sees Dr. Hawkins twice a week for a therapy. Meg tells her, that this isn't her PSTD or anything else for that matter. This is happening in reality. Alex then begins to bleed from her abdomen, much to her confusion. Meg tells her to stop fighting what brought her back and wake up.\nAs Alex wakes up, she finds herself in the apartment of the man, she met in the alleyway. She's pissed, that someone attacked her and now she is being held as hostage by some creep. The man tells her, that she can leave whenever she wants and only took her to his apartment for safety. He continues, telling her, that the artifact hasn't completely merged with her and Alex is at her most vulnerable until the host transfer is complete. Alex doesn't believe him and decides to leave. The man tries to talk her out of this action by telling her, that a scavenger already has tried to kill her in her apartment. He warns Alex, that next time it will be something worse.\nAlex still doesn't believe him, thinking he's crazy. The man tells her, that she should stop resisting the artifact as it kills the hosts who reject it. He then asks, what are her last memories. Alex tells him, that yesterday the husband of one her clients was following her. Believing to have lost him in the subway, Alex goes to interview his housekeeper. As she climbs up the fire escape ladder onto the roof, she's shot in the chest and falls off the building. Alex then asks the man if this is hell. The man explains, that this is opposite of hell and the power of the artifact comes from the moment of host's death. It gives life, but the price is, that she has been seeing and hearing strange things.\nAfter hearing all this, Alex decides to go to check on Myra, much to her guardians objections. He suggests, that she should wait another few days, until the artifact bonds with her. Alex disregards his warnings and proceeds to leave. Outside, she tries to get the Witchblade in its bracelet form, off of her hand. The Witchblade warns Alex, that if she does it, she will die. The artifact tells her, that it needs a host to survive, to give it voice and flesh. And in return, the Witchblade will gift her with visions of the past and future and incredible power, as she is its host.\nAlex then calls, Debbie who reveals, that without the maidens statement, Blake has been released. Hearing this. she rushes to Myra's apartment. As Alex walks into the apartment, she finds Blake holding Myra at gunpoint. Myra then bites Blake's arm in order to get the pistol. Although she succeeds, Blake punches her and then prepares to shoot her. Blake tells Myra, that if she didn't the drive, she be in an oil drum in the East River by now. Myra responds by telling him to shoot her already as it has to be better than spending another second with him. Before Blake can do that, Alex conjures multiple appendages, which impale him.To be continued..."

        "content": "Sara Pezzini (Comics)Biographical InformationRace:HumanGender:FemaleStatus:AliveCharacter InformationAffiliation:Vincent Pezzini(Father)Julie Pezzini(Sister)Hope Pezzini(Daughter (before reboot))Logan(Ex-Husband)Occupation:NYCP Detective(Formerly)Private Detective(Current)Real World InformationFirst Appearance:Witchblade Issue 1\nSara Pezziniisan NYPD homicide detective whose life changed when she came into contact with a powerful and ancient weapon known as theWitchblade, which bestows its wielder with impressive powers.\nSara Pezzini was born November 18, 1970, and is of Italian descent. Her major enemies areKenneth Irons(whom she briefly dated before discovering his evil nature) andIan Nottingham(sometime love-interest and ally).\nSara first appeared inCyblade/Shi #1: The Battle For Independentsin 1995. She had wanted nothing more in her life than to be a good cop. As a homicide detective in New York City, life was challenging enough, but for Sara, those were simpler times. While on an undercover case at the Rialto Theater, both she and her partner, Michael Yee (named Danny Woo in the TV series), were mortally wounded. At this same theater was a man named Kenneth Irons, who had brought a gauntlet known as the Witchblade. Irons was in search of the secrets to unlocking its full power and ability.\nWhile Sara lay dying, the Witchblade made his choice to include her in the long line of women that he has shared his power with. The entity healed Sara's wounds and allowed her to survive the resulting confrontation. Since then, she has seen many things she never knew existed, fought creatures that have no place on Earth, and longed for the days of a typical NYPD detective. But she continues her struggle with the Witchblade, believing that she can do more good with the entity than without. So the battle for control continues, as Sara learns more about this entity and struggles to stem his violent nature.\nSome of Sara's allies include the Magdalena,Lara Croft, and Jackie Estacado. One crossover pitted her against Wolverine. In the comics recently, Sara has been through a grueling ordeal fighting off a giant demon (a false \"god\" summoned by a group of priests), in the midst of which her partner, Jake McCarthy, was left wounded. Before losing consciousness, Jake professed his love for Sara and told her that he always knew about her double life. He now remains in a coma, and Sara has had to deal with a nosy new partner, Patrick Gleason, who has already discovered many of her secrets. Gleason saved her life and it had begun to look like they may become more than just partners, but their sexual date was interrupted when Ian Nottingham abruptly returned to Sara's life.\nAfter a minor crisis that led to the death of Sara's good friend and loyal partner, Jake, Sara discovered she was pregnant. Sara was completely confounded at how this occurred – due primarily to the fact she has not had sex in over a year. Sara, initially feeling she was not ready to be a mother, nevertheless decided to keep the baby, but decided as a result she could not keep the Witchblade as well. Sara relinquished it on to Danielle Baptiste, a young woman she had recently met who was its next chosen bearer.\nWhen she was due to give birth, the father of her child was revealed – it was Jackie Estacado, who, \"possessed\" by the Darkness itself, was driven to seek out and have sex with Sara's comatose body, and, with Jackie's body used for the necessary biology, leading to the conception of their baby – a child to upset the balance between the dark and light. Sara gives birth to a baby girl, but is on the verge of death. Danielle then ends up sharing part of the Witchblade with Sara, which saves Sara's life. Hope, Sara and Jackie's daughter, drives off The Angelus and in the end Sara, now wielding half The Witchblade, and her friends return to their lives. This pregnancy has caused an attraction between Jackie and Sara that has manifested itself as romantic and even sexual.\nLater, a major conflict erupts between Sara and Danielle, with Sara under the control of the Darkness portion of the Witchblade. During this time Sara became increasingly irrational, angry and would often mistreat the people around her, however she did display more increased control over the entity demonstrating abilities usually associated with the Darkness (summoning dark-based objects, creating Darklings etc.). Manipulated by an old enemy of the Curator, Sara re-took all of The Witchblade in a battle with Danielle. However Sara was saved when Danielle was chosen as the next Angelus host and cleansed her of the Darkness' influence, restoring Sara to her former self.\nWhile Sara attempts to redeem herself for her crimes under the Darkness-half of the Witchblade, an Internal Affairs agent named Phipps discovered the truth about the Witchblade through Jake McCarthy's diary. He confronted Sara, demanding that she either resign as a detective or give up the Witchblade if she doesn't want to be exposed. Sara chose the former. She then moves to Chicago, working as a private investigator.\nSara is a strong, determined, and mature woman. One of her defining characteristics is her black-and-white view of the world and of people, something that many characters in the series have called her out on.\nSara Pezzini (Comics)/Gallery"

Now the Justice League has the difficult task of fighting one of its own! But with members like Wonder Woman and the Huntress among the JLA, and the Witchblade being drawn to female hosts, the League might be serving up exactly what the Witchblade needs for its own wicked ends!\nKenneth Irons travels to Metropolis in order to meet with Lex Luthor. Irons wants to get the Witchblade, and he's hiring Luthor to do so. Several days later, in Gotham, Witchblade stumbles down the street. She's brutally beaten, and dying. She busts in on Barbara Gordon, her old friend, and asks for help. After seeing her, Barbara immediately sends her to Justice League Watchtower. On the Watchtower, Martian Manhunter examines Sara and determines that before he can heal her physical pain, he must heal her mental pain. Manhunter then proceeds to probe her mind, and sees a scene in which Luthor's robots blow the heck out of Witchblade, sending her into the situation she was just so recently in.\nElsewhere, Irons is furious at Luthor for not yet bringing him the Witchblade. Luthor calms him down, saying that after the first attack, he now knows more about the artifact. He also reveals that Sara has been transported to JLA Watchtower. Luthor asks Irons if he didn't miss any information about Sara's affiliates in JLA. Irons answers that he had no such information and is concerned about taking on the entire JLA. Luthor calms him down again, saying that it has been done before.\nBack at Gotham, Barbara finds a fragment of Witchblade and inspects it. She also informs Batman about her finding, although he's not happy that she transported Sara to Watchtower without a security clearance and without even knowing her identity. Barbara explains that she's her friend and she will respect Sara's right to make her own decisions about disclosure.\nMeanwhile at the Watchtower, a protective cacoon forms around Sara, slowly healing her wounds. Manhunter, Batman and Aquaman are confused as to what Witchblade is. Martian Manhunter theorises that it's some short techno-organic symbiote. Aquaman decides to go to Atlantis library as the Witchblade looks somehow familiar to him. Then Oracle's communication system glitches. Batman is very alarmed, because he designed the systems, and his systems don't glitch.\nTogether with Plastic Man and Huntress, Batman decides to go and check on Barbara. When they show up at Oracle's, and they find her turned into a giant Witchblade spider. The Witchblade is moving from host to host, seeking the most powerful woman in the direct vicinity. They fight the spider, finally defeating Oracle by cutting her off from the internet, which the Witchblade travelled through. The Witchblade then jumps onto the Huntress and possesses her, but before she can anything, Batman knocks her out with a batarang.\nLater, Batman checks on Barbara as she drinks a calming, herbal tea. Batman then forces her to reveal Sara's identity. Back at the Watchtower, the JLA  inspects Huntress, concluding that she has bonded with a fragment from Sara's Witchblade. Once the symbiote spreads to the brain, it searches for any weak point in the personality psycho-matrix it can exploit. Much to everyone's shock, the fragment then joins back with the Witchblade.\nAt the Atlantis library, Aquaman discovers what he was looking for earlier about the Witchblade, and rushes off to tell the League. He reveals that more than ten thousands years ago, there existed a sorceress with a powerful gauntlet just like Sara's. They called it \"corruptor, possessor, slayer and seducer.\"\nMeanwhile, Wonder Woman, while examining the Witchblade, becomes the unknowing host. Wonder Woman is not immediately overcome, as her pure spirit saves her. As the Witchblade \"disappeared\", the JLA searches for it. Sara wakes up for a few seconds, surprised to see the Witchblade gone. Martian Manhunter senses a turmoil in Wonder Woman, but she calms him down, saying that she is perfectly fine.\nElsewhere, Luthor reveals to Irons that when the Witchblade will be in the company of JLA, it will go to Wonder Woman. Irons then asks if he means that it will be easier to take the artifact from Wonder Woman than from Sara, to which Luthor agrees. He explains that Wonder Woman will be inexperienced and overconfident with the Witchblade. Then, all they need to strike at right moment.\nBack at the Watchtower, Martian Manhunter continues to monitor Sara's condition as Plastic Man watches other JLA members if they found something. Superman and Steel stops an asteroid that suddenly veered off-course toward Earth. Batman and Huntress visit a museum exhibition of art by inmates of Arkham Asylum, that goes wrong. Aquaman and Green Lantern help a sabotaged nuclear submarine. And Flash investigates bomb threats in 25 cities around the world.\nMeanwhile, Wonder Woman gives a speech on women in the 21st century, then is overcome by the Witchblade and declares that women around the world should rise up and throw off the yoke of patriarchal tyranny. She then beats up UN senators who doesn't listen to her. She then senses the same machines sent by Luthor who attacked the Witchblade before and goes after them.\nBack at the Watchtower, Sara finally wakes up and is happy to be free of the Witchblade. Plastic Man then informs them about Wonder Woman being possessed by the Witchblade. As much as she like to stay free of the artifact, Sara can't do it at someone's else expense and decides to have a talk with the JLA. Sara concludes that the Wichblade looks for a perfect host - an absolute innocent it can corrupt absolutely. Martian Manhunter having seen into Sara's psyche, adds that she's most worthy of the responsibility for the Witchblade. Then Steel informs everyone, that his sensors have tracked down Wonder Woman.\nThe JLA confronts Wonder Woman, who easily defeats Superman. The Flash then quickly takes him to project Cadmus were he can be taken care of. The JLA try to restrain Wonder Woman, but she manages to overpower all of them. Then Green Lantern faces her, but is quickly defeated too. Sara arrives, and she commands the Witchblade back to her body. It comes, reluctantly.\nLater that day, Luthor is furious with Irons as to clean up this mess cost him a lot. Irons claims that it was Luthor's own fault. Both men are furious with each other and after sending threats to each other, they cut all ties.\nMeanwhile at Gotham City, Barbara and Sara share a drink and remember their childhood. Barbara says that Green Lantern is still cheesed about the fact, that the Witchblade held as the strongest weapon in the universe. Sara answers that he should get over himself and the two laugh."

        "content": "Katarina GodliffeBiographical InformationRace:HumanGender:FemaleStatus:DeceasedCharacter InformationAffiliation:Stalker(Friend)Medieval Spawn(Ex-lover)Real World InformationFirst Appearance:Medieval Spawn/Witchblade Issue 1\n\nKatarina Godliffeis aWitchbladewielder, appearing in theMedieval Spawn/Witchbladecrossover comic.\nThat afternoon in Merrie, England, Katarina refuses to pay her bill. The taverns owner,Stalker, asks her to be reasonable as she was the one that started the conflict, which in turn damaged his tavern, hence the bill. Katarina doesn't remember starting any fights. Stalker quickly reminds her, that he insulted Vulvar the Viking and proceeded to kick the living crap out of him. Katarina points out, that it was because he made a vulgar statement about her looks. Stalker fires back, that she does this every night and this behavior is begging to take a toll on his business. As Katarina is broke and doesn't have money to pay the bill, Stalker gives her two options: either fill up a wagon with dung and drive it to Jobbie McGurk's Dung Emporium or have sex with him.\nKatarina decides to go with the first option and begins filling the wagon with dung. Stalker then asks as to how did Katarina ended up without money. She explains, that she signed on as a convoy guard with Dylan The Welsh, but in the end got lost, which in turn stopped them from reaching their destination and getting paid. Without warning, Katarina's right arm envelopes in Witchblade, which proceeds to create a burning spear just as the Darklings attack them. With the help of the Witchblade, Katarina fends off the attackers as theMedieval Spawnjoins to aid her. Their combined forces prove to much for the Darklings and they proceed to run into Stalker's tavern. The Spawn in turn, completely blows it up.\nAfter this, Katarina questions if he's a sorcerer or something and how did he knew her name. The Spawn eludes the questions, when both are startled by Stalker shooting the last living Darkling with a crossbow. Stalker is unhappy with the Spawn destroying his tavern and also asks about the gauntlet on Katarina's hand. Katarina tells him, that the gauntlet just jumped on her when they started fighting and that it feels good possessing it. The Spawn then leaves, sensing that the rip between worlds is closing once again. Although Katarina objects as he didn't answered her questions, the Spawn adds that the elves ofFaerieare in danger and he must go and help them. As the Spawn steps through the portal, Stalker suggests Katarina in following him, as he heard about the wealth Faerie possess. The Witchblade then begins to glow and Katarina decides to comply and the two step through the portal too.\nMedieval Spawn, Katarina and Stalker overlook the ruins of the once great kingdom of Faerie. Suddenly, they hear the moaning of aleprechaun. The Spawn pities the creature and asks it as to where his attackers went. Meanwhile, Stalker expresses his disgust towards leprechauns for inspiring various Irish stereotypes. After the leprechaun tells about his attackers to the Spawn, Stalker proceeds to step on him, which kills him. This enrages Spawn, which asks for the reason he did this. Stalker explains, that he just wanted to put the little creature out of his misery.\nKatarina then interrupts the two and asks the Spawn if the leprechaun told him where the army of Darkness went and who do they belong to. Although the creature didn't revealed who commanded the army, he did tell the Spawn that the army went toBel-Gadryel, the centre and capitol of Faerie. Unfortunately the leprechaun didn't told him where the capitol is. The Witchblade then points them into the direction of Bel-Gadryel. Seeing the blade act on its own, the Spawn asks Katarina if she is sure she can control it. Katarina is unsure, but looks forward in finding out what exactly it is and has a feeling they both could be a good team. Stalker remarks, that he and Katarina could be a good team too. The thought infuriates her.\nLater the Spawn asks Katarina to tell a little about herself. Katarina reveals, that she used to be in the army and then she went freelance. Although her that wanted Katarina to be a nun, she rejected this idea. She also likes to drink and fight. The Spawn then asks if she travelled somewhere. Katarina answers, that she's been all over the place, from the north of Norway to halfway down Africa. Spawn then asks if she's been to Italy, Sardinia. Katarina answers, that she's been there about five years ago, but the Spawn corrects her, that it was nearer seven years.\nKatarina instantly catches this corrections and demands answers as to how would the Spawn know all about this. Before he can explain, Stalker alerts them to oncoming army of the Darkness soldiers. As the two fighters face the attackers, Stalker decides to run away. As one of the Darklings are about to catch him, Stalker drops his crossbow on the ground, which proceeds to unload all its arrows at the creature and kill it. Meanwhile, one of the Darklings manage to knock off the Spawns helmet. For this, the enraged Spawn proceeds to rip apart the Darkling, frightening both Katarina and Stalker. After the battle, Katarina asks the Spawn if he's okay, but he tells her to keep her distance as he puts on his helmet. The group then continues their journey.\nAs they set up a camp for the night, the trio are approached byRoyale, pretending to be a sorcerer who wanted to stopLord Cardinalefrom attacking Faerie. Unfortunately, the enemy's strength is beyond anything he could ever hope to vanquish. However, Katarina holds the power to destroy them all. Royale tells her, that he has been watching her progress too and proceeds to explain about the Witchblade, Lord Cardinale and his witch-queenElinor. He tells them, that he can transport the group to the castle with the help of his magic. Before accepting this offer, the Spawn talks in private with Katarina and Stalker about Royale. Although Stalker doesn't trust Royale, Katarina decides to accept his offer and get to the castle much quicker.\nAs they reach Bel-Gadryel, Lord Cardinale finishes off the last of the Faerie warriors and commands his minions to spread out and find their magic artifacts. Royale then suggests the Spawn and Katarina defend the tower ofCor'Myreth, where the treasure that their enemy covets lies. Meanwhile, Royale himself will enter the tower and neutralize the source of the elves power, so Cardinale couldn't take it. The Spawn and Katarina decide to with this plan and defend the tower as Royale enters it, secretly calling them idiots. Stalker then decides to elude the battle and instead follows Royale in order to keep an eye on him.\nSoon after, Lord Cardinale and his forces approach the tower and are surprised to see the Spawn and Katarina guarding it. Although Elinor warns Cardinale about the Witchblade, he quickly proceeds to attack them after Katarina insults him. The two warriors then face off against the thousands of Darklings and its leader.\nThe ensuing explosion, caused by Royale's explosive arrow shot at Stalker, pushes him out of the towers window. As he falls to his death, his caught by the Spawn down below. Stalker then explains, that it was Royale who did this to him and he isn't on their side.\nMeanwhile with barely thirty warriors left, Lord Cardinale finally decides to retreat. Seeing this, Royale amplifies the Witchblade's power, letting it to take control of Katarina in order to prevent Cardinale from escaping. With Witchblade in control, Katarina turns on the Spawn and attacks him. Katarina quickly overwhelms the Spawn, but before she can finish him, he reveals that they were once lovers. This revelation snaps Katarina out and she manages to regain control over the Witchblade. They then face Lord Cardinale and Elinor. As the Spawn fights Cardinale, Katarina faces off with Elinor.\nBoth Cardinale and Elinor are outmatched by the Spawn and Katarina. As the last resort, Lord Cardinale calls on the every last ounce of Darkness power to him, which in turn causes Elinor to slowly crumble away. Royale then telepatically contacts Elinor and offers to save her. Without thinking much, she immediately accepts this offer. Instead of truly saving her, Royale imprisons Elinor in a pocket dimension for threatening him earlier. Meanwhile, Lord Cardinale calls upon vines and begins to strangle both the Spawn and Katarina. Katarina then calls upon the Witchblade and breaks herself and the Spawn out of the vines. She then impales Cardinale through the chest and the Spawn proceeds to cut off his head.\nAfter the battle, the trio realize that Royale has escaped. Stalker then steals a full bag of Faerie gold, much to the Spawn's objections and the trio return to their own world. Having returned from Faerie, the Spawn tells Katarina, that seven years ago, when he was still human, he travelled in Mediterranean when the ship stopped at Sardinia for provisions. The Spawn met Katarina in a tavern and immediately fell in love with her. They then spent a night together. He continues by telling, that because of their love, Katarina was able to take back control from the Witchblade. Katarina objects this claim, saying that although remembering him certainly distracted her, she mastered the Witchblade by herself and it nothing to do with him. She also adds, that it was only a one-off thing and nothing more. Katarina also asks why didn't he tell her about this earlier to which the Spawn answers that it was because he's not the same the man he was back then. Although, Katarina asks to explain further, the heartbroken Spawn refuses to and rides away alone.\nAfter the Spawn leaves, Katarina decides to let the Stalker buy her a pint after they count the Faerie gold. Unfortunately as they open the bag, they find the gold have turned to lead in their world. Having went through all this trouble and gained nothing from it, Katarina clenches her Witchblade preparing to punish Stalker for this.\nKatarina is brass and tough. Because of this, she would often get into fights, while under the influence of alcohol, especially after someone would make a vulgar comment aimed at her looks. Katarina also is sexually carefree, as she saw the night she spent with the Spawn as one-off thing, that didn't meant anything to her, unlike to the Spawn of that time. Although she believed herself to be a good person, Katarina didn't reject the thought of stealing gold from Faerie's."

She was then left in the care of an abusive father. Eventually, Debbie was taken to an orphanage calledSaint Albans. The orphanage served as a local halfway house for drug-addicted runaways. At some point while being there, Debbie was molested by the father Brady Miller. When she reveals what the father had done to her, nobody believes her.\nSoon after, Debbie fled the orphanage and became a drug-addicted prostitute. Some time later, she was approached by a strange man, offering her money if she partakes in medical experiments. Debbie agrees. When she sees the facility, Debbie realizes that she made a mistake. She soon is put through various experiments, including trying to bond her to theWitchblade. The bonding is successful and she immediately goes on a mindless rampage, killing the scientists that were experimenting on her. Moments later, she was knocked out and put into a cell.\nHaving spent what felt like years to her with only the Witchblade keeping her alive, Debbie finally manages to break free. She then tracks down her former friends, Josh Corolla and Chris Carlisle, and kills them for turning their backs on her when she needed them most. When DetectiveAkane Nakikoconnects to Josh's mind, Debbie, with the help of the Witchblade, breaches her mind and begins to monitor her.\nAs Akane sleeps, Debbie appears in her dream, telling her that she believed the detective could help her, but she was wrong. Later, when Akane connects to Chris' corpse, Debbie speaks directly to her, telling her that it had to be this way, which startles the detective. When Akane learns Father Miller's location from her partner, Sam Takahashi, Debbie thanks her for this information.\nDebbie then goes to the new orphanage where Miller is located. As Miller is about to rape a girl, Debbie approaches him. She forces Miller to read her diary as she slowly kills him for molesting her many years ago. As Miller dies, he tells Debbie that he loved her and he thought she loved him, too. He then apologizes and dies.\nAfter killing Miller, Debbie goes to a local arcade, which used to be Saint Albans orphanage. When Akane searches the arcade, she finds Debbie sitting in the corner. Through Witchblade, Debbie shows Akane how she became a drug addict and a prostitute, hating the entire world for what it did to her and how she gain the Witchblade.

Through the Witchblade, Akane manages to convince Debbie, that she's being controlled by the artefact, who preys and manipulates her fears. After hearing this, Debbie casts out the Witchblade from her. Both Akane and Debbie then hug with the detective saying, that she knows how difficult is life.\nHaving spent all her life being used, abused and controlled, Debbie was full of hate and anger. She hated the world for how unfair it treated her. After gaining the Witchblade, she let it control her in order to gain her revenge against the people who mistreated her. Debbie is also easily triggered by people who call her a monster, as she nearly strangles Takayashi for calling her that."

Josh tells the detective, that after getting home from work at night, he started to hear strange noises from his bedroom. At first he thought, that it was mice, but then he heard screech and figures it must be a big rat. As he goes to check his bedroom, he finds nothing out of the ordinary. He then notices an open window, which is supposed to be sealed shut. When Josh closes the window, he notices someone else in the room. Before he can see who is it, he's shredded apart.\nSuddenly, Akane hears someone apologizing to Josh. Josh immediately recognises the mysterious female voice as the one who killed him. Akane then wakes up from her trance, confused as to what just happened. As Akane leaves the murder scene, her partner Sam Takahashi expresses his displeasure towards her cybernetic origins. She then drives home and goes to sleep. In her dreams, Akane sees someone trying to get into her apartment. As she wakes up, she decides to have a shower. Out no where, a woman appears behind her. The woman tells Akane, she believed detective could help her, but she was wrong.\nAkane wakes up, realizing that it was just a nightmare. She then receives a call from doctor Kesato who urges her to come by his lab right away as her brain waves patterns are off the charts. Akane tells him, that it just nightmares, but the doctor reassures, that this is different. Moments later, Akane visits the doctor at the Aurora Industries. After few tests they conclude, that as she conducted her investigation, someone else breached her mind. Takahashi then comes by, telling them that there's been another murder in the Elysium Park. Doctor Kesato is not happy about Takahashi's behaviour towards Akane, but believes they eventually will find a common ground.\nWhen they reach the Elysium Park, a local cop greets them and makes a misogynistic comment aimed towards Akane. She quickly points this out, embarrassing the cop. Inside the slum, Akane connects to the murdered man. The man sees the mysterious woman, which Akane has seen before, approaching the man. The man feels remorseful for what happened to her in St. Albans as the woman kills him. The woman then speaks directly to Akane, telling her that it had to be this way, which startles the detective.\nLater in the car, Akane tells Takahashi to look up information about Saint Albans. While at first thinking it to be person, Akane corrects him, revealing that its actually a place. Takahashi finds that its an orphanage. Akane then hears the mysterious woman's voice, calling her. As this happens, she nearly loses control over the car. Moments before hitting a truck, Takahashi takes the wheel and stops the car. Akane then tells Takahashi to drive. Hours later, after a quick ride and a thorough exam at the Aurora Industries, the technicians find no damage done to Akane. Akane's artificial intelligent mainframe interface, AIMI for short, suggest her telling Takahashi about the killer entering her mind. Nakiko explains, that she first needs to get more information about this killer, before revealing her condition. She orders AIMI to not tell anything to her partner.\nAfter the medical exams, Takayashi reveals, that they have a meeting with lieutenant Seldin in the conference room as they have a theory as to what is happening to her. Takayashi then tells, her that Saint Albans was local halfway house for drug-addicted runaways. Both victims were students there when a scandal broke out revolving around one father Brady Miller who molested three kids. Takayashi comes to the conclusion, that the killer will target the Miller next.\nThe two then meet lieutenant Seldin in the conference room. Seldin reveals, that Aurora Industries sought an outside contractor called Cyberdata to develop weaponry for the cyborgs they were developing. In response to Aurora's search, Cyberdata came here with a weapon they were experimenting, the Witchblade. Seldin explains, that the Witchblade chooses only notable wielders, that are female. If male tries to use the artefact, he will either lose his hand or die. In order to use the artefact, Cyberdata spent years trying to find the right fit. Some women were even fitted with cybernetic implants in a failed attempt to make the Witchblade work properly. Seldin believes, that the killer responsible for the two murders is the new wielder of the Witchblade. Before detectives leave, Seldin warns them, that the Witchblade is extremely difficult to defeat by force. The wielder must be convinced to give it up.\nLater at SIU headquarters, Takahashi reads information about Brady Miller to Akane. For molesting three children, Miller was sentenced to a twenty four years in prison. The sentence was reduced to six years for good behaviour. After leaving the prison, Miller started another halfway house in Macropolis, under a different name. Anakine then questions if one of the victims could be the killer, but Takayashi tells her, that they all live elsewhere and have alibis that checked out. He then calls Miller, warning him that he's in danger. Miller reveals his whereabouts to Takayashi. As Akane hears this, she hears mysterious woman's voice in her head, thanking her for this information.\nWhen they go to Miller's house, they find him already murdered. Takayashi ponders, that the killer somehow monitored them. Akane doesn't anything, although she blames herself for Miller's death. As Takayashi goes to question the kids, Akane connects to the now dead Miller. She sees Miller about to rape a girl, when the mysterious woman approaches him. The woman forces Miller to read her diary as she slowly kills him for molesting her, many years ago. As Miller dies, he tells the woman, that he loved her and he thought she loved him too. He then apologizes and dies. Akane then wakes up, seeing the same girl, Miller was about to rape, approaching her. Akane tells her, that she shouldn't be here, but the girl calms her down, saying, that she knows why it happened. Detective then asks if the girl knows where women went and the girl answers, that she went home.\nDetectives then go to a local arcade, which used to be Saint Albans orphanage, where Debbie Santalesa should be. Takayashi tells Akane, that when Debbie was molested by Miller, nobody believed her. When Akane searches the arcade, she finds Debbie sitting in the corner. Through Witchblade, Debbie shows Akane how she became a drug addict and a prostitute, hating the entire world for what it did to her. She then took part in the Witchblade experiment for money. As the Witchblade bonded with Debbie, she went on a mindless rampage, killing the scientists, that were experimenting on her. Moments later, she was knocked out and put into a cell. The Witchblade kept her alive and for that, Debbie trusted it. Akane tells her, that she can trust her.\nOther detectives finally notice Debbie and open fire on her.

He then watches and toys with them.\nSara Pezzini is working undercover in order to catch a local mobster Pellegrini. They dance together on New Year's Eve in a plaza. Outside the plaza, her partner Hank sits in a van, monitoring the situation. He warns Sara to be careful. Suddenly, her hand starts to become a Witchblade only to quickly comeback to normal. She starts to feel really hot and Pellegrini then reminds her of Jackie Estacado. Sara then fakes to fainting, prompting Pellegrini to invite her into his suite.\nInside the suite, Sara and Pellegrini have drink. After Pellgrini takes a sip of his drink, he quickly becomes ill and runs to the bathroom. Meanwhile, Sara questions her before this night and them recalls than Hank has retired four years ago. She thinks that she's hearing Witchblade, but then remembers that it is mute. At that point room service comes into the room, revealed to be Jackie Estacado. Jackie has come to kill Pellegrini. As Pellegrini starts to spit with blood, he hears their conversation and comes out to kill them. As Pellegrini comes out to confront them, both to their shocked a chestburster bursts out through his chest. The chestburster then runs off to Central Park. Both Sara and Jackie go after it.

        "content": "Danielle BaptisteBiographical InformationAlias:DaniRace:HumanGender:FemaleCharacter InformationOccupation:Dancer\nDanielle Anastasia Baptisteisan impulsive-but-good-hearted young woman, was born in New Orleans and is of Frenchdescent, the daughter of Amos Baptisteand Police Captain Peyroux.She moved to New York to pursue a dance career, a dream she had since she was nine years old. After graduating, she became increasingly frustrated about the lack of direction in her life.\nAfter having a strange dream about a mystical gauntlet, Dani was drawn to an antiques shop owned by the mysteriousCurator, who would later become a trusted confidant of hers. It was there that she encounteredSara Pezzini, the then-current bearer of theWitchblade. The two had also encountered each other previously on the steps of Sara's police department when Dani had bumped into Sara. Dani instantly recognized the Witchblade as the gauntlet in her dreams. She impulsively decided to accept it from Sara, who was expecting a baby and didn't want to deal with the adventures the Witchblade invariably drew. At first, Sara was dubious about handing the Witchblade over to Dani. After seeing the Witchblade respond strongly to her, however, Sara relinquished the blade to its new bearer.\nDani eventually learned that the Witchblade was actually a balance between two primal forces of the universe—an entity of light known as theThe Angelusand an entity of dark known asThe Darkness. She was drawn back home to New Orleans after her father suffered a heart attack. While waiting by his side, Dani fell asleep and had a nightmare involving herself in a haunted house, seeing an African boy with his eyes and mouth sewn shut. The shock woke her from sleep. Noting how stressed she is the nurse on duty told her to go out and relax. Dani complied, enjoying an evening out in New Orleans. However, she was harassed by three young men and punished them by drawing them into a dark alley and unleashing the Witchblade, almost choking one of them to death. It was then she realized that the Witchblade had a mind of its own and that she would have to exert more control over it.\nShe was confronted by a mysterious fortune teller. Dani assumed the woman to be a charlatan, but the fortune teller stated that while she does tell people what they want to hear, it doesn't mean she truly possess precognition. When Dani described her nightmare, the fortune teller identified the location of the dream as the Desormeaux house. She explained that a few hundred years ago, when her husband died,Madeline Desormeauxshowed her true nature, torturing and abusing her slaves. When one boy managed to escape to the village below, the townsfolk descended on the Desormeaux house, but Madeline escaped and the house has been abandoned ever since, its ground made a graveyard for her victims. Dani was instructed to go to the graveyard if she wanted to get rid of the nightmares. She did so and was confronted by rotting and deformed ghosts of Madeline's house. They begged Dani to help set them free by bringing Madeline to them so they may have their revenge. They directed her to the Desormeaux and stated that they could not enter, for it is Madeline's place of power. Dani agreed and promised to bring Madeline to them. She then went into the house, and after a brief fight, emerged triumphant. The ghosts then had their revenge on Desormeaux, and were able to move on. The graveyard and the house disappeared.\nShe was left feeling increasingly unsure whether or not she could control the Witchblade. She returned to her father's bedside and was delighted to find him conscious. She promised to stay by his side for a few weeks to help his recover and then return to New York, resolving to get rid of the Witchblade after her ghostly encounter. However, she would end up changing her mind later after an encounter with Sara's archenemy,Celestine.\nWhile out to dinner with a friend, the Witchblade starts acting up. Dani is forced to leave the cafe prematurely as she tries to hide her mystical gauntlet. She is then found bythe Angelus, who had possessed Celestine. The Angelus reveals her intentions to use Sara's unborn child to finally win the war against theDarkness. She tried to recruit Dani to her cause, but was refused, as she fled. In her attempts to warn Sara, she unintentionally led the Angelus right to her. TheMagdalenaand Jackie Estacado, the host of the Darkness, defend a pregnant Sara, whom Dani assisted during labor. Dani was successful in delivering a beautiful baby girl, but Sara was exhausted from labor. The Witchblade then split itself to save Sara's life. Both women had one half of the Witchblade, which they used to fight the Angelus and her warriors, before the baby ended the battle when she unleashed a mystical explosion that dispatched the Angelus and her warriors. The child was named Hope, after Sara's grandmother.\nLater, Madame Kostigian, Dani's dance teacher, asked her to take over introductory classes while she returned to Poland to be with her sister, who has cancer. In the first class she taught, Dani met a girl namedFinch. While teaching another class with Finch, Dani sensed something wrong and asked Finch to explain why she was sad. Over coffee, Finch revealed that her boyfriend, Rock, was trying to turn her into a prostitute to pay their rent. When Dani stated that she may be able to help, Finch excitedly kissed her. However, Finch immediately apologized and left. While accompanied by Finch, Dani fought Rock at his apartment, using the Witchblade to frighten him. During this encounter, Rock was accidentally shot and killed by a friend of his, who quickly departed. A shaken Dani then went to Sara for help, and the two moved the body into the street, making it look like a suicide for a case Sara was investigating. An angry Sara then lashed out verbally, and she and Dani parted ways.\nDani soon let Finch share her apartment and explained to her the nature of the Witchblade. Finch commented that it didn't feel like metal and moved in for a kiss, but Dani stopped her, unsure of her sexuality.\nThe next morning, Dani heard Finch screaming and rushed to her aid. Finch explained that she saw a woman made of fire who simply smiled at her and vanished. Dani identified the entity as the Angelus Force and decided to go to the Curator for answers.\nThe Curator informed Dani that when the Witchblade was divided, so, too, were its essences. While Dani's half represented the Angelus, Sara's half represented the Darkness. Without balance, the chaotic nature of Sara's half was slowly corrupting her. Dani then considered giving the \"light\" half of the Witchblade to Sara, but was told that doing so would not remove the Darkness's influence from Sara's body, as its effects had already become too great. As such, Dani resolved to recover the second half of the artifact. She sets out to confront Sara in a final battle but is defeated and loses her half of the Witchblade. Before Sara can deal the killing blow, however, the Angelus, having finally possessed Finch, arrives and saves Dani by transferring its power into her. Unlike most previous hosts, though, Dani's personality is not suppressed and she manages to stop the Angelus from killing Sara, instead using her new found powers of Light to free her friend from the taint of the Darkness. She is last seen parting with Sara (on good terms) and going with Finch back to New Orleans.\nDani has returned home to New Orleans and is moving in to an apartment with Finch. After leaving the apartment, she and Finch are attacked by a multi-headed chimera, Dani is forced to call upon the Angelus, but is nearly defeated only to be saved bySabine, one of the Angelus' followers. Sabine then takes Dani with her to the Angelus' home realm.\nAs Dani is not fully taken over by the Angelus, she only has a vague memory of the Angelus realm as she is guided through it by Sabine to the throne room where the remains of a previous Darkness host, pierced by an Angelus spear, is being kept. Sabine talks Dani into planning an attack on Jackie Estacado, however she rejects by saying that Jackie is a friend, causing a little bit of unrest from her warriors. Sabine is briefly able to calm them before reminding Dani that the Angelus is suppose to value their realm over mankind, Dani then remembers that Finch is left on Earth and returns just in time to save her from two men attempting to rape her. Finch was upset at being unexpectedly left behind, to which Dani apologized.\nThe next night, during Mardi Gras, Dani and Finch go to have a coffee with Dani's father, Amos, who is not yet aware of their relationship. When Dani is in the bathroom she is brought outside by Jackie's Darklings whom she destroys. Jackie and Dani have a brief conversation that ends with Jackie attacking her since they are meant to kill the other. Jackie takes the upper hand and is about to kill Dani in an alley but Finch interrupts Jackie and punches him in the face to the awe of his Darklings. But before the Darklings could murder Finch, Dani seizes the opportunity to fight back and as she starts to, the Angelus Warriors come to her aid. Jackie and Dani reach an agreement and go both their separate ways. Later at their home Dani and Finch kiss only for Amos to interrupt them in shock. After sharing a awkward moment, Amos gives Dani his support, but he says he is not comfortable talking about at the moment so they agree to talk about it over dinner latter. After Amos leaves Dani and Finch make love.\nSoon after Dani and Finch are done Sabine, bearer of The Wheel of Shadows, breaks into their room with a group Angelus of warriors demanding that Dani gives her the power of the Angelus. Sabine uses her powers to greatly age Finch, and transport herself along with Dani to the realm of the Angelus, where they began their battle. Sabine starts to win the battle until she realizes that The Wheel of Shadows cannot be removed, Dani uses this moment to grab her spear embedded in the Darkness corpse to pierce Sabine. Dani spares Sabine's life in exchange to return Finch to normal. After the deal is done Dani and Finch embrace then get ready to meet Dani's father for dinner.\nDani rushes to aide Sara after learning Sara's sister,Julie Pezzinihad been killed and her daughter Hope has been kidnapped by Aphrodite IV. By time she makes her way to Sara, Jackie is already there. Dani and Jackie start to argue on who failed to protect Hope, but Sara uses her powers to neutralize both before a fight starts. Dani and Jackie agree to uphold to their truce while rescuing Hope. Soon after wards, Tom Judge; bearer of the Rapture, appears explaining that someone took him out of Hell and that the Curator warned him an event that involves the The 13 Artifacts.  \nAt the kidnap site the group is attacked by the demons that were hunting Tom Judge, after they defeat the demons they relocate to a church. Tom explains further detail about an event involving Hope and the other Artifact bearers, and how this event can end the world. Sara tells Tom that all she cares about is finding hope, and at that moment Tilly Grimes, a friend of Tom's, walks in saying \"saving the world and saving Hope are the same thing\".  \nAfter Sara and Jackie go looking for the bearer of The Heart Stone, Dani talks to Tom about how long Tilly has been trying figure out whats going on and both feel that time is running short. Soon after Patience, burst the through the door and attacks Tom Judge because she believes it was him who was murdering priests. A fight between Patience and Tom breaks out; Dani puts an end to it. Sara and Jackie return with Abigail van Alstine, the Necromancer. Sara explains to Patience that it was not Tom who had been killing priests, and that the group needs her help. After everyone is calmed and introduced, Tilly Grimes explains that they need to find the thirteenth Artifact bearer and bring him to their side.\nSeeking information about the thirteenth Artifact and its bearer, Sara, Dani, and Jackie arrive at the home of the Curator. Sara and Dani go in while Jackie takes a call from,Michael Finnegan, bearer of the Glacier Stone. The women find the Curator in a possessed state. All he can say is \"there is no hope\" and then he explodes. Sara uses the Witchblade to shield Dani and herself from the blast. When Sara retracts the Witchblade she hears Jackie yelling for them. After Sara and Dani get up, they explain to Jackie what the Curator said before the blast and then Jackie tells them that Finnegan called to explain the Blood Sword was taken from him.  \nWhen back at the church, Sara argues, with Tom Judge as he tries to convince her to stay with the group. Dani agrees with Tilly Grimes that the Thirteenth bearer must be found. As Sara and Jackie start to leave, Aphrodite IV comes through the door and is immediately attacked by Sara. Aphrodite IV is assisted by Cyberforce, who then attacks the Artifact bearers.\nAfter Jackie Estacado rewrites the universe, Dani is a police detective working with Gleason in New York City, investigating the deaths of the Curator and a Bulgarian gangster, both murdered by Estacado. She is no longer the Angelus host in this universe, though she slightly recalls her past memories, such as when she encountered a nurse, who had discovered the Bulgarian corpse, possessing the Ember Stone.\nIn the middle of the night, Dani receives a call from Tom Judge, now an FBI agent, asking if she knows about the Angelus, to which she shows none. As she returned to sleep, she had a dream where a white bird began pecking at her chest before she sprouted feathers and screeched. She then woke up and tracked down Judge, who was under attack by Angelus Warriors. She saved the life of Tilly Grimes, who was the bearer of the Rapture before passing it to Judge. Judge explained his suspicions that Estacado was behind the whole mess. After confronting him to confirm it, he stated that Dani needed to become the Angelus again in order to restore their proper universe. He passed her the Rapture, knowing that the Angelus is drawn to it. While waiting for the Angelus to find her, Dani ran into Finch but both had forgotten they were in a relationship. The Angelus then appeared and possessed Finch instead of Dani.\nAs Dani is a professional ballet dancer, she is very agile and dexterous, and using the powers of the Witchblade, she makes her self a formidable foe.\nAs the former host of theAngelus, a primal force of creation representing Order and Light, she possessed enhanced strength, speed, self-propelled flight, light beams, and most importantly, the ability to create objects and sentient beings of light. Her powers were limited, however, since functioning in complete darkness quickly drained and negated them."

As their visitors landed in Cerro, they were welcomed by the Mayans, including their king Teotihuacana and his daughter, Maitea.\nThe visitors gave the king an unknown piece of technology and then proceeded to leave.

She is the most powerful of the first-generationClonebladeSisters, the wife ofReiji Takayamaand the biological mother ofRihoko Amaha.\n﻿Reina is a first generationNeogeneand one of the only fewClonebladesto be introduced into the anime who is the head medical researcher at the NSWF.\nSix years prior to the start of the series, she worked alongsideReiji Takayamafrom Doji Group on a collaboration research team on the Witchblade. It was noted during that time that Reina tested high compatibility to the Witchblade, but the staff at Doji wouldn't hear of someone from NSWF to be compatible to the Witcblade. One day, Reina steals the Witchblade and goes into hiding.\nSome time later, both Doji and the NSWF located Reina and the Witchblade. Doji sentX-Conswhile the NSWF sent in Cloneblade Sisters to retrieve the Witchblade. At the moment the X-Cons and Cloneblades attacked, the Witchblade awoke from its slumber and caused a huge cataclysmic earthquake known as \"The Great Quake\". Sometime afterwards, Reina returned to the NSWF and was given a Cloneblade.\nReina makes contact withMasane Amahaat the end of Episode 4, saying that Masane, with the Witchblade, is disappointing. AsShiori Tsuzuki(Reina's assistant) begins to breakdown from her first confrontation with Masane, Reina begins to study the full capabilities of the Witchblade from the research she has, and that one day she will eventually breakdown as well.\nAfter she learns of Shiori's fate, she begins to question whether or notRihoko Amahais her biological daughter. To prove so, she goes as far as taking a maternity test to see if they are related. InEpisode 13, Reina takes custody of Riko to see how she would react to motherhood and at the same time experiences her breakdown after the fight she had withNora.\nAs she begins to breakdown, she experiences maternal feelings, such as when she begins to cry unexpectedly. During this time, she comes in contact with a second generation Neogene namedMaria, who says that Reina is her mother.\nAfter leaving Maria in her home to give Riko and herself some time to get as far away as possible, Reina senses the incredible power Maria holds. Later, Reina's car gets stuck while at the same time she notices that Maria, along with a few X-Cons from the city, is catching up. She leaves Riko in order to keep her safe from the psychotic Neogene and promises that she'll be back for her.\nThen after Maria finds Reina somewhere in the woods, she threatens to get rid of Rihoko for getting in her way of being with her \"mom\". Reina replies by stating that she will not get rid of Rihoko and transforms. Then, Maria asks why she hates her and says that she'll get rid of her, too, and attacks.\nAs Reina's fight with Maria continues, Maria begins to get irritated that Reina is dodging her attacks to a point where Maria injures Reina and manages to crack her blade. Then Maria prepares for another attack, only this time, she uses her extendable claws to pierce through Reina's shield, the tree behind her and back again. She retracts her claws and exclaims that this battle was way too easy.\nAs Maria checks to see if Reina is down, she gets ready to find Rihoko. Before she can have a chance, Reina grabs her by the ankle to stop her. As Maria asks why Reina's stopping her, Reina doesn't have an answer for her. So, Maria calls Reina weak and that she can't be her mother, then she gets flung to a tree and is impaled by Maria with her bare hand. Reina cracks a painful smile and manages to wound Maria in the process, which in doing so managed to break her blade. She then states that Maria has incredible power and that she musn't abuse it.\nIn the end, Reina has a final talk withReiji Takayamaand asks if Rihoko is safe. As she is dying, she reveals that she felt pleasure during the fight and other feelings she had for Takayama many years back. As she finishes her sentence, she begins to crystalize, giving her the appearance of slumber.\nReina was initially shown to be a nonchalant, intelligent, tactical and emotionally detached woman with a somewhat cold-hearted and robotic demeanor. This was most likely due to her being created as aNeogeneand her relative sheltering underTatsuoki Furumizu, causing Reina to not have much emotional development, despite her advanced intellect and accelerated aging.\nDue to this, Reina was shown to primarily spend her time studying herself more than anything, including having to keep an audio log of her actions and thoughts during the course of her life in order to properly analyze herself. Due to this constant analysis of herself, Reina was stated to have performed several \"tests\" on herself in order to learn more about herself.

Out of all of theNeogeneFirst Generation Sisters, it was stated that Reina was the most powerful and that her genetics and incredibly powerful potential made her a perfect match for theWitchblade.\nIn fact, her genetic potential was so powerful that it was implied that the immense power and potential that her two biological/genetic daughters,Rihoko AmahaandMaria, the former of whom was the true intended bearer of Witchblade, and the latter being the strongest Neogene surpassing her own power, were all inherited from her.\nReina was stated to be the strongest Neogene on record of the First Generation of Cloneblade Sisters and was stated to have been undefeated by them prior to the emergence of Maria.\nAlthough originally, Reina was stated to be at the peak of the genetic potential and power as a Neogene, she was noted to have dropped dramatically in power after giving birth to her biological daughter and was stated to no longer be a suitable candidate to be the Witchblades bearer."

When the Romans came, they violated and slaughtered her people, while Samantha herself was taken as slave to city far away. For half of her life, Samantha served her lord needs, who would abuse and neglect her in return. One day, her mistress stepped between Samantha and the lord as he was about to hit her. The lord then proceeded to beat to death Samantha's mistress with her cooking pot.\nWith her mistress dead, Samantha bribed a male slave into taking her letters to her lost family. Unfortunately, they were discovered and the slave was killed. When the Romans found the letters, they accused Samantha of espionage as they assumed the letters contained the information she heard during many government meetings. Samantha was locked in the dungeon. Eventually, the dungeon was set on fire and Samantha managed to escape into the countryside, with no food and no means to find any. Eventually she was found by group of druids who believed that she was the professed warrior, that was said to get rid of the Romans and return the land to its Celtic roots.\nThe druids then taught Samantha the art of war and literature, to steel her against the challenges that awaited her. After her training was finished, they gave Samantha the Witchblade and let her go. Samantha then return to her home and find out from the people living there as to what happened to her parents. Her father tried to organize a revolution and free his town from Roman influence. The townsfolk gathered under him, but when he was discovered they quickly distanced themselves from him. Most even cheered when they watched Samantha's father and mother be executed. After hearing this, she decides to leave.\nOn her way out of the town, Samantha came across a drowning man. The man turns out beHorace, the towns elder. Horace thanks for saving him and then asks the woman as to where she came from, as they don't see many outsiders in their town. Samantha dodges the question when suddenly they hear a woman scream.\nAs they run to check out what is happening, they find three Roman guards harassing a couple. While two guards hold the man, the third one decides to rape thewoman. Horace tries to stop them, but instead is beaten by the guards. Seeing this, Samantha decides to step in. With the help of the Witchblade, she quickly kills the three guards.\nThe townsfolk are impressed by Samantha's skills. She says that the townsfolk should have dealt with the Romans years ago. Horace answers that the people are too weak to resist the Roman occupants. He then offers to give anything the woman wants if she helps to defeat their occupants. Samantha refuses saying that they barely have anything.\nSamantha then has a warm bath, when a young girl approaches her, saying that there are guards outside the house. She quickly gets her clothes on and escapes through the window in order to avoid the guards. Unfortunately, the guards notice her and proceed to surround her. Afraid to be burn as a witch for using the Witchblade, she lets the guards to knock her out.\nTwo days later, the Samantha wakes up in a prison cell with a woman she saved earlier. The woman named Cecilia, reveals that they have been implicated with the murder of those three guards, which Samantha killed earlier and are set to be executed in an hour. She also reveals that Horace was killed by the Romans to quell the possibility of a revolt. Cecilia then asks what will she do now. Samantha, says that she's will kill every Roman she finds. She shows Cecilia the Witchblade, which was given to her by the druids and tells her life story.\nSoon after the women are taken for the execution. Cecilia is horrified to see her lover,Geraldabout to be executed. As the newgovernororders the executioner to cut Gerald's head, Samatha unleashes the Witchblade. Although Samantha manages to get out of her bonds, she fails to save Gerald and he loses his head. Samantha then kills the executioner, frees Cecilia and then tells her to get out of the town. Cecilia refuses, saying that she can't abandon her home and instead joins the fight. Samantha then rallies the townsfolk to rise against the Romans. As the Romans fight the townsfolk, Samantha sets on fire the building the governor is residing and then the rest of the buildings.\nThe governor manages to escape the building and sneaks up on Samantha. Although he manages to subdue Samantha, the Witchblade shreds him into pieces. Cecilia then blames Samantha for destroying their town and letting the townsfolk to be killed. Samantha explains, that just before she came across Horace, she found about what became of her parents years before. Her father tried to organize a revolution and free his town from Roman influence. The townsfolk gathered under him, but when he was discovered they quickly distanced themselves from him. Most even cheered when they watched Samantha's father and mother be executed.\nCecilia tells Samantha, that the townsfolk were just weak and scared and needed someone to rally them. She then asks her if this what her father would have wanted. Samantha says yes and then leaves with tears running down her cheeks.\nHaving spent half of her life being abused and neglected, Samantha felt anger and rage towards the Romans and anyone else who would abuse others for their benefit. Thus she couldn't ignore when people were getting hurt and would immediately jump to help them."

And was shown to have been active since prior to theGreat Quakein Tokyo.\nShiori, in particular, was among the five Cloneblade Neogene Sisters sent to pursueReina Sohoafter she stole theWitchblade, and was seen to try and capture her together withNorabefore theX-Conssent by Doji could and was at the epicenter when the Witchblade awakened and caused the quake.\nLater, after surviving the quake, Shiroi would be assigned as an assistant to Reina after she was accepted back into the NSWF due to her powerful genetic potential. Shiori, in particular, would develop a deep sexual fixation with Reina.\nShiori first appears killing several ex-cons underTatsuoki Furumizu's instruction alongsideReina Soho, where she is spotted byMasane Amaha, the wielder of the Witchblade. Because Furumizu wanted her to retrieve the Witchblade at all cost, she took it upon herself to try to kill Masane and remove the blade from her, and she took a disturbing amount of pleasure in doing so.\nIn the battle, her scythe cuts into Masane's chest, but fails to kill her. Before she could land a killing blow, Masane was taken away by an armoured ambulance, which Shiori pursued aggressively, and attempted to kill everyone on board by crashing onto it from a great height. Realizing that she had failed to kill Masane, Shiori tried to attack the boat that Masane was being loaded onto, only to be stopped by Reina, who saw that Shiori was losing a grip on her sanity and risking countless motorists' lives.\nAt the NSWF medical facility,Reina Sohotook a blood sample from Shiori, worried about her health. At this point, it was revealed that Shiori had a deeply unhealthy obsession with Reina, and would often touch Reina's body somewhat inappropriately and lick her hands afterward.\nReina showed concern that Shiori's battle wounds weren't healing, and began to suspect that Shiori was undergoing some kind of change, but wasn't sure what it was. It becomes clear that the damage sustained to her Cloneblade had a bizarre effect on her mind, causing Shiori's already-evident psychosis to increase. She then murders her nurse for no reason other than pleasure, only to suddenly become confused and forget what she'd done, only saying, \"I feel weird.\"\nShiori then began begging for help from Reina, then kissed Reina and told her that she killed the nurse because she wanted to know what it would feel like. She then added, \"It felt so good, thank you.\", and leapt out of the medical center window.\nShiori breaks down\nTheCloneblade's damage meant that it was slowly killing Shiori, and its psychological damage made her constantly seek pleasure, causing her to murder several innocent civilians. The Cloneblade then reactivated inside Shiori, causing her to take a different blue form, and Shiori flew over the seawater to attackMasane Amaha's boat.\nShe then killed 2 of the crew only to be confronted by Masane in Witchblade form. Desiring the Witchblade's power for herself, Shiori violently attacked Masane, but was shot byReiji Takayama. Surviving the blasts because of her power, Shiori threw Masane andHiroki Segawaoverboard, and attempted to rape Takayama, but then succumbed to the Cloneblade's damage and her body crystallized before turning to dust.\nShiori acts arrogant and confident, but is soon revealed to have little to no control over her impulses as aClonebladewielder.\nShiori'sClonebladeform"

        "content": "Ian NottinghamBiographical InformationRace:Altered humanGender:MaleStatus:AlivePhysical descriptionHair ColourGray/BlackReal World InformationFirst Appearance:Tales of the Witchblade Issue 9Voice Actor:Eric_Etebari\nIan Nottinghamis a British and Native American descendant and first appeared in Witchblade #1.\nFormally a Captain of the Special Air Service for the MI5 (British Security Service). He underwent modifications toward his behavior to be able to go undercover perfectly. He has been raised since childhood byKenneth Irons, who wanted to mold him into the perfect warrior. This included beating and torturing him so that his body would be able to withstand pain. He is a master of Sun Tzu's Art of War and as an adult, stays employed by Kenneth Irons. He has also once been romantically involved withSara Pezzini.\nIan was born April 21, 1966. In Witchblade Destiny's Child, he and his brother were orphans. Young Ian was a troublemaker and a bully. He was adopted by a man who wanted to turn him into a killer. His \"father\" succeeded.\nWhen sent on a mission to Japan to kill a woman, Nottingham fell in love with his target and with the Japanese culture. The tumultuous end of that love affair had a hand in making him so cold, so controlled. \"Never again\" became his motto. In the end, he returns to England. Ian is single, and lived in New York, NY with Kenneth Irons.\nNottingham was indebted to both the Yakuza and to Kenneth Irons. He's considered a member of a Yakuza family, not unlikeJackie Estacadoof the Darkness who is the adopted son of a Mafia family. He has attained a high rank in the Yakuza, yet remains a ronin of sorts, working for whomever he chooses.[1]Ian undergoes a constant internal battle between his feelings for Sara Pezzini and his loyalty to his mentor, Kenneth Irons. His relationship with Irons can now only be qualified as a hate-use relationship, although Nottingham once considered Irons to be his friend. Obviously, that was not the case. Irons volunteered Ian's body for super secret government testing under the aegis of PROJECT ODIN. The experiments have fused Nottingham's adult DNA with some undisclosed element. Because of the testing and certain special conditioning, Nottingham has been the only man to \"successfully\" wear the Witchblade. Ian has been shown to possess a number of mystical powers, including enhanced speed and strength.\nThe odd markings on his right hand, courtesy of Irons, allows him to bond with both the Witchblade and the Darkness. And for a short time, both powers preferred him over Pezzini and Estacado. As the villainousSonatineput it, Nottingham's body and soul were built to absorb mass quantities of power, \"whether voluntarily or not.\" He didn't ask for the Witchblade. Sonatine, the nemesis of Jackie Estacado, asked Nottingham to take the Darkness. When he said no, Sonatine bewitched him and suddenly Nottingham was a puppet. In a strange twist of fate, Estacado and Pezzini encountered Nottingham in a museum, and police detective and Mafia hitman had to work together to save the world from him.\nApparently when the Witchblade and the Darkness powers -- both fairly malevolent entities -- meet in one soul, they transform that soul into a doomsday machine. Together the Witchblade and the Darkness are Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. Which roughly translates into one of the Seven Seals of Armageddon. Jackie took back the darkness power and prevented destruction, however Witchblade chose Ian over Pezzini that time. Unknown to all participants a new entity, Weave, had born out of the union.\nWhen Irons' obsession with the Witchblade sucked him in, Nottingham was deeply curious about how the gauntlet would feel on his arm. But once the rune met the stone, he quickly came to wish he had not been curious at all. Because the Witchblade is a sentient power, ungovernable by any who have not been born to wield it -- and even difficult to those chosen women. And Nottingham, despite his extreme cool, his self-possession, and his strength, could not bend the Witchblade to his will. In fact, the gauntlet controlled him. He eventually lost the Witchblade to Pezzini in a battle which gave him serious injuries.\nHe was nursed back to his health by a Japanese girl called Setsuke. After she made an attempt at Gavin Taylor's (a famous rock star turned guru with connections to Kenneth Irons) life, Irons made him kill her, and Ian angrily obeyed.[2]Kenneth & IanRecently, Ian has acquired Excalibur which has brought a new edge to Ian's life. The depths of this newfound power, and its effects on Ian's life have yet to fully manifest themselves. He cannot really control it yet either. If he uses Excalibur, he gives in to it and it takes him over, pretty much just like the Witchblade did. Ian Nottingham believes in the power of the human will and that through sheer force of will almost anything can be accomplished. Ian also has the belief that all life is chaos and that the control of life is fleeting at best. These beliefs have proven themselves time and again throughout his life. Now, in the possession of Excalibur, Ian is forced to struggle even harder to control that life.\nIan, with Excalibur, killedTora No Shiduring the Deathpool storyline.\nIan lost Excalibur, revealed to be part of Witchblade to Sara after she beat him senseless in a fight.[3]With the WitchbladeIan has recently reappeared, pursued by Yakuza assassins and begging Sara for help. He also seems to have lost Excalibur since he never uses it to defend himself, was asking if he could borrow the Witchblade, and later is seen stealing The Blood Sword from theCurator's Artifact shop. He uses the cursed katana to kill off any opposition and take control of the local Yakuza and when Sara shows up invites her to join him in his life of crime. Sara is not impressed. After arresting Nottingham, she returned the cursed katana to the Curator's shop.\nIan's stay in jail was a rather short one because Ian escaped Ryker's prison and then had a Central Park battle with Sara. Ian offered Sara to follow him so they can live a life of love making reference to Sara's current life that was full of stress and constant battles because of the Witchblade. Sara refused, causing tension between the two character which resulted in one of the best fight scenes during the series. After hitting pregnant Sara a few times, one with a crude haymaker to the face, the other a side-stepping kick to the stomach, Ian makes a sexist comment before Sara defeats him using the Witchblade. Detective Pezzini arrests Ian and sends him back to prison. It should be noted that Sara decided to give up the Witchblade because of this battle.\nIan has displayed superhuman feats of speed and strength. Body and soul built to absorb mass quantities of energy. At one point in the comics he has the mystic ability to siphon the powers of both theWitchbladeand theDarkness. Ian in the comic series becomes the wielder of Excalibur (here shown as a sentient weapon, and a part of the Witchblade) which can act like armor, produce energy blasts & constructs, and decreases the aging process.\nEven before he acquired other powers, he displayed superhuman abilities, such as cutting cars in half with his sword and catching bullets in his hands. Ian has above average intelligence and has enhanced speed and strength. Ian is also an accomplished martial artist and swordsman--his preferred weapon is a katana-- and he has had black ops training.\nIan Nottingham is played byEric Etebariin theWitchbladelive-action series made for television[4]In the TV series, Nottingham's origins are different from the comic book version. Kenneth Irons' Vorschlag Industries engaged in highly suspect genetic engineering to create and clone at least two versions of Ian Nottingham from Elizabeth Bronte's preserved stem cells. Bronte was a chosen wielder of the Witchblade in WWII and is presumed to be Sara Pezzini's grandmother. She was murdered by Irons in order to gain the Witchblade for himself.\nIan Nottingham (Eric Etebari)"

At some point, she met an infamous pirateJack Rackham. They immediately fell in love with each other. Although women were forbidden on pirate vessels, they knew they had to be together always. And thus, Anne joined the Jack's pirate crew.\nAfter aquiring a rare treasure map during a tavern brawl, Jack and Anne found themselves in the company ofWilliamandMary Read, a pirate team whose love for hunting the rarest prizes brought them together. Although the map warned that the entireislandis alive, they headed to a deserted island. As they explore the island they find it to be unusually alive. When they get deeper into the jungle, one of the crew mates namedJamesis grabbed by a bunch of vines. He's then eaten by a giant carnivorous Venus flytrap much to the horror of his crew mates.\nEven with loss of James, the crew continues their journey.

She then tellsRicoto go back to the beach and signal them as soon as he sees the enemies. As Rico turns around to go the beach, the ground comes to life and buries him together with his monkey.\nEventually they comes across a mound of bones and treasures close to a waterfall.

As Andy enters the water, he senses something touching his leg. When his fellow crew mate reaches the mound and he puts on the Witchblade, it proceeds to blow off his arm. As Anne sees a pack of panthers emerge from the water, she tells Andy to immediately come back. Before he can do that, the panthers attack him and shred him to pieces.\nThis distracts the team, enough that Blackbeard is able to attack Annie by surprise. While William and Mary are captured, Annie jumps towards the Witchblade and takes it. She accepts the call of the Witchblade who tells her, that it controls every living and non-living entity on the island.\nAt the shore of the beach, William and Mary are about to be executed by Blackbeard's crew when Annie jumps out of the jungle and traps the pirates in the cage made out of earth. One of the crew recognizes the Witchblade, calling it the Blade of Fire.

        "content": "Witchblade (Artifact)Biographical InformationAlias:DigitabulumThe BalanceRace:Primordial BeingGender:MaleStatus:AliveCharacter InformationAffiliation:The Darkness (father)The Angelus (mother)Hope Pezzini (half-sister via Sara Pezzini)Real World InformationFirst Appearance:Witchblade Issue 1\nTheWitchbladeis a conscious, intelligent, and ancient weapon with supernatural origins. It is one of13 mystical artifacts, of which twelve have been revealed:the Witchblade, the Angelus, the Darkness, the Ember Stone, the Glacier Stone, the Rapture, the Blood Sword, the Spear of Destiny, the Coin of Solomon, the Heart Stone, Pandora's Box, and the Wheel of Shadows.\nIt is the offspring of the universe's two opposing aspects, the Darkness and the Angelus (Light). The Witchblade is a male aspect created to act as a balance, which must have a female as a host, but has not spoken aloud as of yet.\nThe Witchblade is the offspring of the universe's two primal forces, the Angelus and the Darkness. To avert mutual destruction, a truce was struck. The Angelus and the Darkness consummated and, in so doing, conceived the Witchblade, creating peace and balance between them.\nThe Witchblade was discovered in modern times in Greece byKenneth Irons, but before he found it, it had many wielders. When not in use, it can look like an ornate, jewel encrusted, right-handed gauntlet. When wielded by an unworthy user, that person will lose their arm. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the host, who can hear the Witchblade. When used, it expands across the body of the wielder, often shredding clothes and covering the body like armour. The amount and coverage of the armour depends on the level of the threat.\nFor example, when facing mortals, it will usually generate less armor than when facing a demon of Hell. This armor can produce extensions of itself that can form swords, other stabbing weapons, hooks, chains, shields and wings, enabling the wielder to fly. It may also become temperamental if the wielder chooses not to use it. When wielded, it can shoot energy blasts from the hand or sword, fire projectile darts, and whip-like grapples to attack or climb structures. The Witchblade is also an excellent lock pick, and can heal wounds, even mortal ones. The Witchblade can reanimate the dead, empathically show the wielder scenes of great trauma, and allow the wielder to relive experiences from past wielders in the form of dreams.\nFollowing the events in theFirst Bornmini-series, the Witchblade was split into two parts. One half belongs to Dani while Sara has reclaimed the other half. However, the Witchblade, originally being the balance between the forces of Darkness and Light, it was revealed in the recentWar of the Switchbladesaga/arc that each half of the Witchblade represented one of the two primal forces: Sara having the Darkness one and Dani the Angelus. This led to changes in the personality of the characters, especially Sara. Encouraged by the leaderless Angelus Warriors and the mysterious Tau'ma, both wielders eventually ended up in all-out war for the complete control of the Witchblade, which concluded with Sara victorious and once again in control of the full Witchblade. She now possesses the full Witchblade, as Dani is now the host for the Angelus.\nThe Witchblade is said to possess a male personality, with several of its characteristics involving the shredding of its wielders' clothing in the generation of protective and revealing armor. The Witchblade is able to pick locks and will become temperamental in cases where its wielders prefer not to use it.\nIn the live-action series, the Witchblade possesses many of the same powers as its comic book counterpart, but manifests differently. In this case, it assumes the form of a metal gauntlet with a red gem that resembles an eye. It has gone by several names across different cultures, including Digitabulum Magae (Latin for \"The Witch's Finger\").\nWhen in use, the Witchblade could produce a blade from the wrist end of the gauntlet form, was durable enough to withstand bullets, and transform into a pata (a sword blade connected to a gauntlet). Towards the end of the first season, including the pilot film, the Witchblade could produce a full suit of armor to cover the wielder's body, but rather than appearing organic like in the comics, the armor resembled the kind worn by medieval-era knights.\nIn at leastone episode, the Witchblade demonstrated organic features, but only when its host was undergoing the Periculum, a trial to determine if she was worthy of the Witchblade, and upon completing the trial, it returned to its bracelet form.\nIn two other episodes, the Witchblade demonstrated the ability to transform itself into a transitional stage between its bracelet form and a form resembling knuckles, enabling the wielder to punch people without harming themselves.\nAccording to Kenneth Irons in the series' pilot film, the Witchblade possesses many powers. Among them was the ability to enable the wielder to win people's hearts. This implies the wielder possessing the ability to win the trust of those around her.\nAccording to Ian Nottingham in the last episode of the series, who likely learned of it from Irons, the Witchblade will not and can not be used to kill anyone that has wielded it before, being only capable of harming them.\nAccording to Sara in the last episode, the Witchblade is a state of the mind and the heart. She also implied that the Witchblade can be wielded by anyone if it were ever rendered vulnerable and therefore accessible in one of its weapon forms.\nThe Witchblade is sentient and responds to the bearer's will, as well as attempting to impose its own.\nIn reverse chronological order (fictional chronology, not publication dates) save non-canon and alternate realities:\nOther identified wearers include Cathain, who is remembered as an Irish Celtic war goddess by history in the live action TV series of the Witchblade. Cathain is connected to the historical Irish Celtic King, Conchobar.\nAlternate Reality\nNon-Canon\nIn reverse chronological order:\nThe Witchblade that was found by Alex Underwood is a different one than the one we know of. The Witchblade appeared to Alex after she was fatally surprised by the husband of a client. The Witchblade healed Alex of her wounds and bonded with her. Here, the Witchblade in idle mode is a metallic wristband instead of a bracelet.\nIn the 2024 reboot, the Witchblade is not a gauntlet but a bracelet that turns into a kind of spider. It is not directly owned byKenneth Irons (Reboot), even if it is searched for by him. In Berlin, Germany, it is in a buried box. When one of the employees finds the Witchblade, he takes possession of it directly. Chased by Irons and his men, the Witchblade changes hosts several times and ends up in the USA, New York. And from there to its new ownerSara Pezzini (Reboot).\nWitchblade (Artifact)/Gallery"

The issue is called\"Savior\".\nThe Witchblade finds a new host, in the form ofG-Force'sPrincess.\nIn east central European country ofBelarus, the sun is setting and an old lady calls her grandson back home in fear of wolves that roam restless this season. She gives the boy food and promises to tell him a story if he eats all of it. The old lady then lets him pick, which one does he want to hear, \"Decoys of Doom\", \"Curse of the Cuttlefish\", \"Race Against Disaster\" or \"The Fierce Flowers\". The boy instead wants to hear his favorite one, the one about the Princess. Hearing this, the old lady gets frustrated as she already told him this story hundred of times, but decides to comply.\nYears before, their land was invaded byhostile alienswho wanted to strip the land of a rich biological resource known as peat. Although it was a simple fertilizer to humans, to the invaders it was the priceless source material for their powerful terraforming engines. Meanwhile, the denizens were enslaved by the invaders in order to rebuild the worlds crushed by their vicious empire. One day, a mysterious stranger was captured by the invaders who managed to take out seven of their best men before the aliens could get off a single shot. The old lady, then being just a little girl, notices the stranger being brought to confinement.\nThe invaders also manage to unearth an ancient citadel that, at its dark heart, housed an unholy artifact. An artifact believed to be born of pure evil that fed on the living. Meanwhile as the stranger is thrown into her cell, the girl manages to sneak into it and bring food and medication to the prisoners. She does this, because her own mother died because of malnutrition and lack of even the most basic medical care. Although she was to young to help her mother at that time, she swore, that when she was of age, the girl never would never stand by and watch the needless death of human life.\nAfter taking some food, the two other prisoners decide to investigate the stranger. As they approach her, the stranger does a back flip and cuts free her binds into the rock behind her. This display of extreme physical prowess comes at the cost of her own strength and she asks the girl to give her water. The girl points out that, other prisoners are afraid of the stranger except for her. Stranger tells, that they shouldn't be afraid as she's here to help them. The girl says that she knew this the moments she saw her and asks the stranger how did she break free of her restraints. Stranger explains, that the acoustics in the cell revealed the dimensions of her confinement and the smell clued her that they where underground, hence shark rock walls.\nThe stranger the proceeds to take out a pill out of a secret compartment in her boot heel, which will counteract the tranquilizer darts the invaders shot her with. She then reassures the girl, that as soon as she contacts her friends they will be shutting this place down and get everyone to safety. The stranger then realizes that her bracelet is gone and begins frantically search for it, only for the girl to reveal her, that the invaders took it. They then hear, that the invaders are coming back and the girl tells the stranger to pretend that she is still in her restraints. The girl then proceeds to hide in a vent.\nHaving failed to find the little girl, the invaders discuss if they should inform their leader, Zoltar about the stranger they managed to capture. In the end they decide that they should tell no one how they allowed a tourist to wander onto base camp without anyone noticing her. They reveal, that the prisoners will be soon offered to the artifact for the sacrifice. Meanwhile, the stranger is contacted by the Witchblade who tells her that it is the means of her revenge, much to the women's confusion.\nElsewhere, scientist are examining the Witchblade, who started to emit large amounts of energy. This confuses the scientists as the artifact didn't gave any usable date even after eviscerating dozens of test subjects. The readings also remind them of brainwaves, which even more puzzles them and they decide to send the report to their resident specialist, Reinhart. Meanwhile, Reinhart in his work tent talks with Zoltar through a computer. Reinhart reassures Zoltar that progress is being made, but invaders leader doesn't trust him as the resident specialist is known to be a thief of ancient relics and traitor of his own race. Having said that, Zoltar asks Reinhart about the progress he made. Reinhart tells Zoltar, that there's little to no information left about the Witchblade, but he confirms that the ancient weapon predates the beginning of modern civilization and throughout history the weapon was passed from bearer to bearer. Also the citadel was built in order to protect it.\nZoltar doesn't care about the artifacts history as he is here to enslave this world. He also points out, that Reinhart's test subjects are cutting into his workforce. Reinhart tries to reason with him, saying that he was hired to figure out what his boys dug up and that's exactly what he's doing. He also warns him, that certain rules need to be adhered to when dealing with this artifact. All Zoltar wants to know is when he can use the weapon against his kind and warns that if Reinhart can't give this answer quickly, he will be dealt with. One of the invaders then shoot Reinhart with a tranquilizer dart. Meanwhile back in her cell, the stranger tells Witchblade to get out of her head, thinking that she's losing her mind. The Witchblade reassures her, that she's no losing her mind and was chosen by the artifact to be its bearer.\nWhen the stranger came to Earth to review this target so that her team could strike it with the utmost efficiency, the Witchblade blew up her motorcycle tire. Witnessing how she dealt with the invaders surrounding her, the Witchblade knew at that moment, that she was worthy to become its bearer. Since the Witchblade entered her mind, it also lets the stranger to witness the artifacts birth and to look upon those who have come before her. The stranger isn't impressed with images sees see, passing it for a trick. Stranger then rallies up the prisoners and comes up with a plan to escape their confinement. Two other prisoners aren't convinced by her plan, thinking that the stranger is crazy.\nElsewhere, the little girl infiltrated Reinhart's tent in order to find out more about the artifact. In the present, the old lady adds, that Reinhart knew exactly what Witchblade wanted and played the invaders for the arrogant fools they were. He knew the Witchblade required a host with a keen sense of purpose and focus. Meanwhile, the stranger kills one of the invaders and plant explosives in the compound. Back in the tent, Reinahart finds the little girl. He reveals that he has heard stories about the little freedom fighter that would dare challenge the great might of Spectra. Reinhart also adds, that if not for her young age, the Witchblade would have chosen her to become its bearer. The girl then tells Reinhart that a powerful stranger has arrived who's going to free them. Reinhart says, that he's fully aware of her as the Witchblade became quite antsy the moment she arrived on Earth. Their conversation is then interrupted by a series of explosions going off outside.\nMeanwhile, the stranger frees the prisoners as the invaders run after them. The stranger then hands the prisoners laser drills. As the invaders confront the stranger, she tells them to look up. When they comply, they see prisoners, armed with laser drills, standing on top of a rock. They then proceed to open fire and kill them. The rag-tag group of freedom fighters then mount an assault on the invaders. Suddenly, Reinhart contacts with the stranger through screens in the compound, revealing to have captured the little girl. He then forces the stranger and the prisoners to give up and meet him in the citadel.\nIn the citadel, Reinhart reveals that although he doesn't who she is or where she came from, the Witchblade has taken a liking to her and she won't be denied. Throughout history multiple women wore the Witchblade, women just like her. Reinhart also says, that the Witchblade is his life's obsession and he sold his soul to the devil, so to speak, in order to witness it. He then forces the stranger to put on the artifact. As she approaches it, the Witchblade takes possession of the stranger and notices an artifact of great power inside of her. Bonded with the Witchblade, the stranger is forced to attack anyone in sight. During the confusion created by the massacre, the little girl escapes from Reinhart's grasps.\nAs the Witchblade begins to tamper with the strangers talisman, she calls out Mark. Meanwhile, Zoltar orders his soldiers to deliver core samples and then destroy the artifact. He also orders to bring Reinhart to him so he could express his disappointment of his performance. The now fully possessed stranger, attacks the invaders and stops them from leaving the planet. The Witchblade then asks the stranger how it feels to have the means of destroying her most hated enemy right in the palm of her hand. The stranger answers that the feeling is liberating. Invaders then send all the forces, including giant machines to stop the stranger. As the miners get stuck between in the crossfire, other members of the G-Force arrive to scene. Their leader, Mark points out that if not for the intense dispersal of energy showing up on the Phoenix's scanners they would never have pinpointed this area.\nMeanwhile a robot is about to crush a woman with her child, when its suddenly shot and destroyed. Mark tells Tiny that he didn't order to fire as they too close to civilians. Tiny explains that it wasn't him. As Mark questions as to who shot the machine, he's sees the stranger, revealed to be Princess, a member of G-Force, completely fused and taken over by Witchblade. She then attacks her fellow teammates as Mark order Jason to take out a mech approaching them. Jason quickly flies up to the mech and proceeds to destroy it with one shot of his gun.\nMark is then caught by the possessed Princess. He tries to break her out of the possession, which causes Princess to let out her suppressed emotions. Princess tells him, that she lost having identity the minute she was forced into joining G-Force, suppress the grief of losing her mother, abandoning her childhood and made into an assassin. Also forced to hide her feelings for someone she loves more than herself. Princess adds that if not for Spectra they all would have a real life. Mark then points out that if not for Spectra they would've never met and the five of them would've never been raised together.\nThis words force Princess to lose her drive and focus, weakening the Witchblade's grip on her. It then forces her to attack her friends. The little girl then brings Princess lost bracelets and Mark quickly puts them on her. The bracelets push out the Witchblade from Princess, freeing her from its control. Princess then thanks the little girl for helping her. The girl tells that she wants to be a hero just like Princess when she grows up, but Princess answers that she already is one. Princess and Mark then watch as relief workers come to help the wounded denizens. They also notice that both Reinhart and the Witchblade disappeared. The two then rekindle their friendship.\nMeanwhile, the little girl finds the Witchblade, now in the form of a bracelet and puts it on. Back in the present as the old lady puts her grandson to sleep, the Witchblade complaints of its portrayal as a villain in her stories. The Witchblade adds that its because it, that the little girl became a hero among her people, eventually becoming an ace pilot. The old lady answers that she's not listening to it. The Witchblade then asks if they could at least kill the wolves. The old lady agrees, but decides to only frighten them as they have been thrashing her garden.

Zakarah then asks if she wants some water or shall they move her out of the heat. Racquel rejects this offers and notices that their marketplace is bustling. Zakarah tells that their people are prosperous and can't wait for the royal wedding. The princess then figures, that Zakarah is stalling her. She then decides to go to Sallah's room personally, ignoring Zakarah's objections.\nWhen Racquel comes into the prince quarters, she finds him sleeping in another women's arms. This enrages her and Racquel orders all the guards to leave. Sallah explains that their coming wedding is only for political reasons as its was planned before either of them were even born. He then tells that love has finally found him. Racquel refuses to share him with another woman. The woman then reveals to beBastet, the goddess of cats.\nAlthough Racquel doesn't believe her at first, Bastet reassures her that she isn't lying. The goddess then kisses Sallah and proceeds to leave as she is needed elsewhere. When Bastet leaves, Racquel tries to convince Sallah, that the goddess is only using him for her own agenda. By having the princess under her control, Bastet will able to wield greater power over men. Prince Sallah refuses to listen to her words and tells her, that although he will marry her, his love will only belong to Bastet.\nRacquel accepts this, but vows to find a way to prove the princess of Bastet's true intentions. She then goes to ask hermothersadvice. Racquel mother is certain, that Bastet has some kind of political agenda. She says that the royal court demands discretion, yet those in love are given to outlandish behaviour. The princess mother then suggests, that Racquel must do whatever is necessary to remove Bastet from Sallah's life.\nShe then seeks assistance from Bastet's peers and much to her surprise receives it fromAnubis, lord of the underworld. Anubis tells Racquel, that she can't engage a god with earthly methods. He then tells, that Racquel will find her help in a cave three miles south from here. But she must go tonight, for his gift will not remain past sunrise.\nWhen Racquel snaps out from her trance, surprised to find out that nobody saw Anubis, besides her. She then immediately heads out to the cave with a group of guards. When they reach the cave, the guards are hesitant to go beyond. Racquel refuses to go back and continues deeper into the cave. Inside, she finds the Witchblade. As she puts on the Witchblade, Racquel feels a surge of incredible power go through her. The guards are horrified by this and try to run away. Racquel proceeds to kill them all in order to keep her new power a secret.\nThe following afternoon, Racquel comes up with a plan to show prince Sallah the true intentions of Bastet. She leaves a fake note from Bastet to Sallah, inviting him to the shrine he's building for her. When Sallah comes, Racquel traps him inside a cage constructed from the Witchblade. Racquel explains to Sallah, that when Bastet comes, she will give her two choices. Either free Sallah and release snakes at her or leave. This way, they will find out if Bastet truly loves the prince. Suddenly, Bastet appears, planning to shred Racquel to pieces.\nRacquel and Bastet begin to fight each other as Sallah tries to calmed both of them down. Racquel reveals that Anubis has given her power to defeat the goddess for stealing Sallah's affection. Bastet denies this, saying that the two fell in love with each other. Racquel refuses to believe her and shoots a blast of fire at her. In order to protect Sallah from snakes coming into his cage, Bastet turns him into stone.\nRacquel sees this as a prove to her doubts of Bastet's love to Sallah. Bastet explains, that now Sallah will be impervious to her spells. She then destroys the snakes in the tomb, so they wouldn't hurt her. Bastet then creates multiple copies of herself and proceeds to overwhelm Racquel. She then puts her to sleep and traps Racquel inside the tomb.\nLater that day, Racquel breaks out of the tomb and returns to her mother. She's enraged for losing to Bastet and vows to not rest until the goddess is dead. Although, Racquel has no idea how to defeat Bastet, herservantpoints out that the goddess, because of her connection to cats, must be to most vain of all the gods. This gives the princess an idea as to to use this to her advantage.\nThe princess mother then confronts Racquel for angering Sallah as he has cancelled the wedding. The princess mother is furious at her, saying that her wedding never had anything to do with love, but with power she would gain. Racquel answers, that she doesn't want Sallah's love, but only his attention. Her mother then reveals, that she has sent Racquel's brother,Mahmoudwith her promises of contrition. She then orders Racquel to apologise to Bastet in order to appease the prince and then marry him. Racquel complies.\nLater, the princess brother, Mahmoud meets with prince Sallah. Meanwhile, Racquel eavesdrops on their conversation. He warns, that if the princess cancels the wedding, Mahmoud's father will go to war with him. Although Sallah is at first hesitant in the end he decides to give Racquel one more chance. After hearing this, Racquel goes to thaumaturgists laboratory below the desert. Thaumaturgist creates astatuefor Bastet, which should trapped the goddess inside of it.Al-Fahidthen asks Racquel to empower the statue with strong magic. After doing this, they test the statue on a cat. As a cat approaches, her soul is instantly trapped inside the statue. Racquel is pleased with the idol and the thaumaturgist asks for his payment. Racquel instead kills him in order to keep the secret about the statue.\nTwo days later, prince Sallah is visited by Racquel. She apologises for her foolishness and wishes happiness to them. She then gives them two gifts. A bracelet for Sallah and the idol for Bastet. As Bastet picks up the idol, it immediately traps Bastet and her pet tigerManares. This enrages Sallah and he begins to strangle Racquel, ordering her to bring back his lover. Racquel explains, that she can't as the Witchblade erects metal appendages into Sallah's body. Although the appendages impale the prince, his immortality prevents him from dying. This helps Sallah to continue strangling Racquel until she dies.\nRacquel was self-centered, determined and very jealous. When she find out about Sallah's affair with the goddess Bastet, she was determined to prove that the goddess didn't loved him and end their relationship. Racquel quickly became obsessed with this thought, to the point, that she was willing to risk Sallah's life to prove, that she was right.\nShe also struggled to understand the concept of love, mostly because of her mothers teachings, revealing that Racquel herself didn't wanted Sallah's love, but only his attention."

Subsequent armors, such as thearmorworn while Stark was Secretary of Defense, remained similar to this design.\nRepulsors were modified including a mild version for 'crowd control' as well as improvements when fired underwater and in space. Firing repulsors and uni-beam simultaneously produced a \"blockbusting\" effect.[2]\nSonic weapons were improved.  A deflector pulse can push objects away from the armor. A magnetic pulse was developed for specific use against theMakluan Power Rings.\nDefensively, EMP shielding was improved. The basic forcefield used wave algorithms to randomly change its frequency. A small energy shield could be emitted from the gauntlets.  Backup forcefields could also be used to cover armor breaches.\nFor security purposes the armor was encoded to Stark's artificial heart. An emergency override key was given toPepper Potts.\nLiquid oxygen cells provided an improved air supply underwater and in space, but were dangerous if ruptured. Under normal conditions a respirator took in and purified outside air.\nA carbon dioxide mix was used for improved underwater propulsion. A searchlight for the helmet was also available for underwater missions.[3]\nUtility tools in the left gauntlet could be used for repairs, bomb disposal, or other tasks."

She was a spy during theNaziregime inWorld War II. She caught and hypnotized anAmerican,Wilhelm Lohmer, who held secrets to theSuper-Soldier Formulathat transformedCaptain America. \"Bill Jo\" White wrote comics, which noted a super-soldier serum and had received secret and key information from his long-time friend Dr. Anderson, a collaborator onOperation Rebirth.[3]Despite objections from her superiors, Koenig decided to try what she had learned of the formula on herself. An explosion took place during the process, and Julia was transformed into a female version of aSuper Soldier.\nOn one of her first missions, Warrior Woman accompanied theRed Skulland a team of superhuman Nazi operatives toWakandato recover a supply ofvibraniumfor the Nazi war effort. She was seemingly killed during the battle by theBlack Panther, but she somehow survived.[4]\nAdolf Hitlerwas so impressed with this new \"Krieger Frau\" that he wanted her to marryhis Master Man. Against her better judgement (and standards), she agreed only because it was Hitler's wish. As part of the celebration inBerlin, Hitler wanted to execute theInvaders, who had recently been captured by Warrior Woman and Master Man. The final vows were never spoken, as reserve members of the Invaders rescued their teammates.\nLater, against her will, she was among the Axis supervillains who were organized by the mind-controllingLady Lotusin herSuper-Axis. She was taken into custody with the rest of the team after being defeated by the Invaders.[5]\nJulia was put into a form of cryonic suspension after the war, not being recovered until after the German reunification. A man who called himself \"Herr Nacht\" had fallen in love with her image, and had re-created the strength formula and taken it himself, becoming a self-proclaimed new Master Man. Unfortunately, it seems her long freeze had given Warrior Woman some brain damage, complicating her recovery.[6]Herr Nacht attempted to use the blood containingHorton Cellsof the originalHuman Torchto try to heal her, but the involvement of theSub-Mariner, Captain America,Union Jack, and an elderlyJacqueline Crichtonprevented that. However, the original Master Man had also been awakened and, tired of her flirtations with Nacht and her constant berating him, took his revenge by blowing up the building they were in. The original Master Man, Wilhelm Lohmer, was later seen alive although reverted to his true age.[7]"

As Captain America and Bucky disappear over the Atlantic[1], Torch and Toro fly into Berlin on April 30th, 1945 in an attempt to capture Hitler before he can commit suicide. When Hitler reaches for a button upon seeing them, the Human Torch believes it to be the trigger for a bomb that would destroy all of Berlin and feels forced to stop him by burning him to death. Meanwhile, Namor fights the Japanese in the Pacific and Spitfire and Union Jack protect Churchill back in London.\nThe remaining Invaders later meet up, learning of Cap and Bucky's deaths, and Namor and the Torches are recalled to the States to meet with President Truman while Spitfire and Union Jack remain in Britain. Truman explains that the Invaders must live on until the war in the Pacific is over. He adds to their ranks the former Liberty Legion members Miss America and Whizzer as well as a new Captain America and Bucky -- formerly the Spirit of '76 and Fred Davis, Batboy for the Yankees who once acted as a decoy for Bucky[2].\nThe new Invaders continue to fight in the Pacific until Japan's surrender, at which point they receive a new Presidential request to turn their attentions to fighting crime at home under the name of \"The All-Winners Squad\". They operate as such for the remainder of 1945 into 1946. One day in '46, the Human Torch decides to visit Phineas Horton's home in Boston to attempt to reconcile with his \"father\", taking Toro with him. When they arrive, they find Horton has made a second android, Adam-II, who has gone mad and imprisoned his creator and fashioned several other robotic servants, including duplicates of humans he intends to replace. With the arriving help of another former Liberty Legionnaire, Patriot, the Torches escape from Adam-II's trap and learn from Horton that Adam-II intends to replace a politician campaigning in Boston. The other All-Winners assemble and spread out to find the mark, and it's Captain America and Bucky that find Adam-II along with a duplicate of a young Senator Jack Kennedy. While Cap desperately sends out a flare to recall his teammates, one of the enemy androids grabs him and crushes his ribs.\nThe All-Winners Squad converge to fight Adam-II, who attempts to flee when Captain America miraculously returns, however he loses control of his getaway car and crashes, seemingly destroyed in the resulting explosion. When the All-Winners are alone, Captain America unmasks to reveal that he's actually the Patriot and that he had found the dying second Cap, who revealed his secret with his last breath.

Zog sent Electro to deliver aid in a flooding inOhio, leading to the capture of mobsterBoss Sarpo.[6]However, Sapro had his minions kidnap Zog and forced him to use Electro to free Sapro from prison and commit a series of crimes.\nZog and Electro's crime spree was short lived as they were soon be kidnapped by theDragon-Menof planetLigra.[7]On Ligra, Zog was forced to use his invention to attack theLion-Peopleand capture their rulerQueen Nara.

Zog was rewarded by being crowned a knight of Ligra before being returned to Earth.[8]\nZog's famed work lead to PresidentFranklin Delano Rooseveltrequesting Zog deal with the threat of the reanimated corpses of the madDr. Bruno Varoz.[9]By this point, Zog had ceased using operatives and took a more active role in Electro's operations. He modified the robot with a televisor that would project the user's face and allow two-way communication between the Electro operator and its environment. With new adaption, Zog came to the aid of his friendJohn Borden, who's lumber property was being set ablaze by the vindictiveBaldwin Drake.[10]Zog once more responded to a request for aid from the president in dealing with theShark, a notorious pirate. For his aid in destroying the Shark's operations, Zog was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.[11]\nZog accompanied his colleagueDr. Simon Craneand his daughterBettyon a expedition to explore the moon, taking Electro along with him.

Deducing that the creature' weakness was radium, he slayed the creature with a Radium Gun and Lorroff was slain attempting to unsuccessfully blow up Electro.[14]\nZog was once more manipulated to use his robot for crime, this time byPrince Omei, who hypnotized Zog to do his bidding. When Zog suggested to the increasingly paranoid Omei that the authorities might use his lab to build a robot to counter Electro, he ordered Zog to destroy it. Unable to bring himself to destroy his own lab, Zog broke free of Omei's control. With his minions revolting and his plan in shambles, Omei set off a bomb, collapsing the building on all of them.

During the ensuing battle with the robotic Green Flames, Zog activated Electro to aid the heroes in defeating the Nazis.[19]\nLater, Zog developed a telepathic interface with his Electro robot and sent it along with many other costumed heroes to storm Berlin in 1945.

Eventually a formal group was gathered by\"Bucky\" Barneswhich includedPatrick \"Knuckles\" O'Toole,Washington \"Wash\" Jones,Geoffry \"Jeff\" Vandergill,Henry \"Tubby\" Tinklebaum, andToro[2].StatusDefunctRealityEarth-616Base of OperationsMobilePlace of FormationNew York City,New YorkCreators and AppearancesCreatorsStan Lee,Charles NicholasFirstYoung Allies#1(July, 1941)(Fictional Story)Captain America Comics#5(May, 1941)(First real apparence)\nIt has been revealed that a lot of the Young Allies wartime adventures were made into a comic book as propaganda for the United States to earn support in the war effort, especially among young impressionable people. The comic book, while based on true events where often times embellished, and sensationalized.\nFurther, to \"protect\" the identities of the Young Allies (however, in later years, Bucky would suspect it was to avoid having to pay out royalties for the use of their likenesses) were all portrayed as caricatures of themselves, and were all portrayed as being young adolescents around the age of 12 while in real life they were in their late teens to early adult hood and eventually became old enough to enlist in the military and see action in the battle field[2].\nWhile Bucky and Toro were portrayed not unlike their true selves, they were childish in their demeanor and would constantly feud overCaptain Americaor theHuman Torchbeing the better super-hero to be the sidekick for. The most moderate parody of the groups membership was that of Geoffry Vandergill, dubbed \"Jeff\" in the comic book he was a verbose young man who was the brains of the group. Next was Henry Tinklebaum who was dubbed \"Tubby\", and his weight and desire to eat over exaggerated. Percival O'Toole's, dubbed \"Knuckles\" had his Irish-American, Lower Class New Yorker background played up to the point of stereotype. The most unfair interpretation of any of the Young Allies in their comic book adaptation was that of Washington Jones. Dubbed \"Whitewash Jones\" his character was a racial stereotype on the same key of a minstrel show, while socially acceptable at the time of publication, this depiction is considered highly racist by todays standards.\nThe fictional accounts of the Young Allies are the most complete record of their activities during World War II, however how much of these tales are fiction and how much are truth have yet to be completely chronicled. For the purposes of clarity between what is known to be fully factual and what is regarded as sensationalized fiction, both will be addressed separately in this profile.\nFollowing the formation of the Young Allies, one of their first adventures involved a battle against the forces of the Red Skull. Before the most feared Nazi soldier could capture them they would be aided by the timely arrival of Captain America and the Human Torch[2].\nThe group later assisted Captain America in locating a secret German Bund in the United States that was intimidating German-American immigrants into supporting the Nazi cause. Thanks to the group's assistance, Captain America was able to shut the operation down[3].\nIn 1943, the Young Allies were sent to Hollywood California for a war bond drive. The rally was soon marred by an panic caused by Bucky and Toro's foeLady Lotus, and they soon broke up the panic[4]. The Allies were then ordered by the military to report to Democracy Pictures to participate in a film that was in support of the war. They were once more targeted by Lady Lotus who hypnotized actors to attack them, and then took Toro under her control[5]. Capturing the team, Lady Lotus hypnotized the rest of the group and as part of her plan to take over the American west coast sent the group in a B-17 and P-40 to attack Muroc Army Airfield. However, Washington Jones snapped out of Lady Lotus' control and managed to help the others break free from her mind control[6]. They would get the air fields participation in a ruse that made it appear their attack was a success. Pretending to still be under the control of Lady Lotus, the Young Allies got close enough to attack her. During the battle, Toro managed to knock a crystal that Lotus was using to boost her powers and it was subsequently swallowed up in the Earth. Lady Lotus then fled, vowing to get revenge against the Young Allies someday[7].\nBy 1944, the Young Allies had mostly split up. Bucky and Toro would be busy working with Captain America and the Human Torch, O'Toole and Jones would enlist in the military and serve in action, while Geoffrey and Henry would join the OSS and operate as spies trying to root outNazioperatives still active in France following it's liberation by Allied Forces.\nMeeting each other in Paris, they would go into action one more time when Geoffrey would spot Hauptman Kleinschmidt and they would attempt to capture him. Easily gunning down his men, the Young Allies would chase the fleeing Kleinschmidt. When Bucky would hop aboard his speeding truck causing it to crash, killing Kleinschmidt. That was the last time the group would be together[2].\nThe Fictional exploits of the Young Allies are lengthy; as such, to learn more about them, see theFictional History of the Young Allies.\nAfter the war the Young Allies drifted apart but always stayed in touch. Geoffry would go on to work for Naval intelligence after the war, and then ultimately join the government agency which became the CIA. Official records state that he died heroically serving his country in Indochina (modern day Vietnam). The details of his death are unrevealed. Hank would leave government service and get into business and would live a successful life until one day in 1984 he was tragically struck by a bus[2].\nToro would survive well into the modern age, he would be put under the control of theMad Thinkerand set to attack his old wartime ally theSub-Mariner. Toro would snap out of the Mad Thinker's control and would sacrifice his life to stop the Thinker[8].\nBucky would seemingly perish attempting to stop a drone plane launched byBaron Zemoon April 18, 1945. However, Bucky would be recovered by the Russians and converted into their assassin the Winter Soldier. He would be placed in suspended animation over the ensuing decades. Ultimately, Bucky would have his memories restored and would take on the title of Captain America following the seeming death of Steve Rogers.\nSurviving well into the modern era would be both Washington and Patrick, both would marry and have children and grandchildren. After the war, Washington would reenlist into the Air-Force and see action in the Korean War. He would be retired at the rank of Colonel. O'Toole would continue in the army and make the rank of Sergeant ultimately becoming a drill instructor until he retired. In his retirement O'Toole would open a bar which he would run until he was too ill to do so and would leave his grandson to operate it.\nLearning that Washington and Patrick were still alive, James would track them down to the hospital room where Percival were spending his final days. After reminiscing about the old days and catching up on lost time, the three surviving Young Allies would drink from a bottle of brandy that was being saved for the sole survivor of the group to enjoy. After their one drink Patrick would die peacefully in his sleep. Shortly thereafter Washington would die following a march at an military inaugural.\nAll the Young Allies have been put to rest in theArlington National CemeteryinArlington,Virginia. It would be visited by James -- as Captain America -- who would dump out the remainder of the bottle of brandy on their grave in honor of his old friends. The grave also marks Bucky's supposed death in 1945, which James has chosen not to have correct as he feels that the Bucky he was during the war died a long time ago[2]."

Upon arriving in the United States he gathered a gang and attempted to break into an US military arsenal but was captured byCaptain AmericaandBuckyand sent to jail. Shortly after his incarceration, the Creeper broke out of prison and vowed revenge against Captain America for his defeat.[1]\nPosing as Ambassador Lissom\nBy December of 1942, the Creeper used his espionage skills (under the name Lissom) to become the American Ambassador to the nation ofAlslavia, the last of the European countries to remain neutral during the war. There he pleaded to King Dane to ally himself with the United States and the Allied Forces, debated against a Nazi operative. Eventually, King Dane decided to side with the Allies and gave Lissom a ring studded with three rubies as a present that he must wear during the signing of the treaty documents.[1]\nKnowing that should the ring go missing it would sour relations between Alslavia and the Untied States, Lissom -- as the Creeper -- stole the ruby and mocked the Untied States government, openly challenging Captain America to try and recover the ring before the deadline to sign the treaty passed. Captain America took up the challenge and when the Creeper's men attempted to rob the U.S.O. headquarters, they were led right to the Creeper's lair.

There they were caught at gunpoint by the Creeper who forced them into the dungeon of his lair and were shackled to the walls.

Rushing to where the Japanese transport planes are flying, the Torch and Toro blast them out of the sky, and the burning oil from the crashing planes cause enough fire to melt the icebergs, ending their threat as well.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nThe Sub-Mariner is proud of Betty Dean, whose investigative reporting has foiled a Nazi plot to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge.

As the battle concludes, anF.B.I.agent namedStuartapproaches the heroes and inquires about a man namedDoctor Anderson. Cap immediately recognizes the name and reflects back on the events that first transformed him into Captain America.\nFlashback1940: Doctor Anderson had been assigned by Washington to collaborate withGeneral Chester PhillipsandDoctor Abraham ErskineonOperation Rebirth. They selected Steve Rogers as a volunteer for a project designed to give him superhuman strength, speed and dexterity. The process worked, but a Nazi spy, present in Erskine's laboratory assassinated Erskine and the secret of hisSuper-Soldier Serumdied with him. Steve Rogers soon went on to become the patriotic hero Captain America.\nSnapping back to the present, Captain America listens intently as the F.B.I. agent tells him that Doctor Anderson might be dead and they need the help of Captain America and Bucky.\nCap and Bucky reach the hospital where they find Doctor Anderson as a patient. Anderson explains to them that he was attacked by Nazi agents two nights ago in an abandoned silo being used as a secret Nazi stronghold.\nHis kidnapper was a man namedColonel Krieghundwho had been developing his own version of the Super-Soldier Serum in order to create a NaziÜbermensch. However, his process was incomplete and Krieghund suspected that Anderson might have knowledge of Erskine's lost procedures. Krieghund subjected Anderson to a device called a Psyphon, which pulled information directly from his brain. Krieghund acquired enough data to complete his project, transforming a Nazi bund agent into theMaster Man. At that moment, theHuman Torchand his sidekickTororaided the silo and fought against Master Man. The battle ended inconclusively, and both Master Man and Colonel Krieghund managed to escape. Seeing that Doctor Anderson was in rough shape, the Torch rushed him to the hospital.\nConcluding his tale, Doctor Anderson tells Cap and Bucky that he suddenly recalls something he heard while held prisoner in the silo. Krieghund and the Master Man plan on conducting a strike against a British warship nearChesapeake Bay. Cap and Bucky reunite with the Human Torch and Toro, and together they race off to fight this new threat.\nKrieghund and the Master Man are aboard a Nazi U-boat en route toHampton Roads. They intercept the course of a British battleship, theHMS Duke of York, and attack it. Master Man leaps upon the deck of the ship and begins fighting with the deckhands. One of the deckhands however, reveals himself to be theSub-Marinerin disguise. The Sub-Mariner was recruited by British Secret Service to safeguard the ship's most important passenger, British Prime MinisterWinston Churchill. As the Sub-Mariner and Master Man fight one another, Captain America, Bucky, the Human Torch and Toro arrive to lend him a hand.\nDuring the struggle, the process that grants the Master Man his extraordinary strength starts to fail, and he begins losing his vitality and muscle mass. Captain America is reluctant to strike such an obviously weakened opponent, but Bucky has no reservations about knocking the Nazi out cold.\nKrieghund meanwhile, launches two missiles from his sub-marine aimed at theHMS Duke of York. The Sub-Mariner witnesses the attack and dives into the water. He catches the two torpedoes and sends them back to their point of origin, sinking the U-boat.\nWith the threat abated, Prime Minister Winston Churchill emerges from his cabin and suggests that these heroes should band together in order to fight the Axis powers. He dubs them theInvaders.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nVehicles:\nEnclosed within a dry cabin, the Sub-Mariner begins to lose his strength.

One of the scientists,Professor Schumann, feared that once an army ofSuper-Soldierswon the war, they would return home and take over America. Schumann suggested the creation of a special robot, TESS (Total Elimination of Super-Soldiers), that would be built to neutralize super-soldiers. F.D.R. went ahead and okayed the suggested project.[1]\nUnfortunately, the only man who knew how to create super-soldiers,Professor Erskine, was killed after creating only one super-soldier,Steve Rogers (Captain America). Now useless, the TESS project funds were cut off, and Schumann was ordered to destroy his work. Instead, the paranoid Schumann took his work to his home somewhere in the Midwest. He completed building the robot and programmed it to kill Captain America. Schumann eventually died and left the robot in a bomb shelter underneath his house.[1]\nYears later, a retired agent of espionage organizationSHIELD,Richard Rennselaer, somehow found out about Schumann's robot. Rennselaer was a mutant that could mentally control machines. Rennselaer's son,Johnny, had been afflicted with \"Nuclear Psychosis,\" causing the boy to totally withdraw from reality. The psychosis was caused by the knowledge of the possibility of nuclear war and its effects. The desperate Rennselaer decided to use his powers to control Schumann's robot and make sure that the possibility of nuclear war was eliminated. He mentally activated the robot, and made it come to him. The robot left the underground bomb shelter, which was now located underneath the parking lot of a Kwikkie Burger. No one saw the robot leave, but everyone noticed the hole in the parking lot the next morning. Two men went down to investigate, but didn't come back up. Captain America's computer information network, Stars and Stripes, informed him about the apparent cave-in and the missing people. Captain America investigated and found the two men unconscious, knocked out by phosgene gas. Captain America rescued the men and then continued to explore the bomb shelter. After avoiding a few more death traps, Captain America discovered the room where the robot had been kept. From clues in the room, Captain America deduced that the room must have once contained a large robot. Captain America found out that the land had once belonged to a retired government man, named Schumann. Captain America then asked all the members of his Stars and Stripes network to be on the lookout for a large robot.[1]\nMeanwhile, nearSalem Center, New York, theX-Manknown asWolverineencounteredBob Frank, who was attacked by the patrons of a bar that Wolverine was at. Bob Frank had once been the super-powered mutant known as Nuklo, the son of the WWII hero, the Whizzer. Frank easily defeated the drunken men and wandered away from the bar. A curious Wolverine followed Frank through the woods. Nearby, Rennselaer, who now called himselfOverrider, was preparing to hijack a semi-truck. He briefly lost control of Schumann's robot, which he called TESS. The wandering robot encountered Bob Frank and attacked him for some reason. Wolverine intervened and saved Frank, but the robot got away.[1]\nOverrider gained control over TESS again, and hijacked a truck going toAdametcoMetallurgy. Arriving at the company, Overrider forced some worker to coat TESS with a layer of Adamantium. Following different trails, Captain America and Wolverine arrived at Adametco just after TESS had been covered with the Adamantium. The two heroes fought TESS and Overrider, but the robot and its master were able to escape. Captain America and Wolverine split up to follow their own leads and met a day later. Captain America found out about the robot's origin, while Wolverine found out who Overrider was. Captain America was contacted by one of the members of his Stars and Stripes network, who had sighted TESS in the back of a van, near an air base in Nebraska. Wolverine and Captain America arrived at the base after Overrider had begun his attack. Working together, the two heroes were able to severe TESS's head, disabling the robot. Captain America and Wolverine stopped Overrider before he sent all of America's nuclear missiles to the bottom of the sea, without detonating them.[1]\nMuch later after being placed in the custody of the US army, TESS was activated by the Super-Adaptoid, and made a member of a loose-knit team of robots, Heavy Metal.[2]TESS and the robots were ordered by the Adaptoid to attack the hero team Avengers on their floating headquarters, Hydro-Base. She-Hulk and Marrina forced TESS off the island, causing the robot to plummet to the bottom of the ocean.[3]\nThe robot was later salvaged and repaired by Doctor Doom. Doom provided the robot with some new powers and sent it after Spider-Man, who had recently gained cosmic-level powers. Spider-Man easily defeated the robot, exploding it. During the battle, the robot absorbed some of Spider-Man's cosmic energy. Doctor Doom then took the piece of TESS-One that had absorbed a small quantity of Spider-Man's energy, planning to use the energy himself.[4]\nTess-One is a robot originally designed as a possible defense against soldiers the U.S. government planned to enhance with the Super-Soldier Serum during World War II. As a result, the robot possesses various superhuman abilities.\nSuperhuman Strength:TESS-One's hydraulics provided the robot with superhuman strength. At peak operating capacity, the robot possessed sufficient strength to lift 25 tons.\nSuperhuman Stamina:As a robot, TESS-One wasn't susceptible to fatigue in the same sense as most organic beings are. TESS-One didn't have muscles to produce fatigue toxins, hence it had potentially limitless stamina. Even after lying dormant for decades, the robot was in perfect working condition.\nSuperhuman Durability:Initially, TESS-One's body was constructed of a durable steel alloy that rendered it highly resistant to physical injury. However,Wolverine'sAdamantiumclaws could easily slice through it. However, shortly after being reactivated, the robot's outer skin was bonded with Adamantium approximately 1 inch thick. This rendered the robot almost invulnerable to physical attack.\nEnergy BeamsandAbsorption:TESS-One was equipped with force beam projectors with in its hands that allowed it to fire powerful bolts of energy. The full power of these blasts and the duration in which he could fire them isn't known. Later, as a result of being outfitted by Doctor Doom, TESS-One gained the ability to absorb energy from nearby sources, and to absorb energy attacks directed towards it harmlessly for the purpose of bolstering its own energy source."

He eventually finds his way to theNorth Sea, where he discovers a tribe ofInuitpeople worshiping a dead man frozen in a block of ice. Still angry at humanity Namor approaches the Inuit, causing them to flee as he throws the ice block into the water. It drifts away, slowly beginning to thaw.\nBy chance, the Avengers are in the area in their undersea craft. They spot the figure in the water andGiant-Manpulls him onboard. Upon inspection they notice that he wears the clothing of long-lostWorld War IIheroCaptain America. Suddenly, he awakens and, in a fit of panic and confusion, charges at the Avengers before realizing his surroundings and calming down.Iron Manasks the mystery man who he is and the Avengers are skeptical when he tells them he is indeed Captain America. After a brief demonstration of his ability they quickly change their minds.\nCaptain America explains his last memories: he speeds towards an experimental plane on a motorcycle with his sidekickBucky. Unknown to the duo, the plane had been sabotaged byNaziagentBaron Zemo. Bucky manages to get on board while Captain America slips and falls from the plane. The last thing he remembers is the plane exploding with Bucky on it as he falls through the sky into the frozen waters offNewfoundland.\nBack in the present day, the Avengers have docked inNew York Cityand are greeted by a crowd of journalists looking for interviews about the battle with Sub-Mariner and theHulk. Suddenly, a camera flashes and turns the team into stone. The journalists think it is a publicity stunt and leave. Aboard the sea craft Captain America awakens and exits onto the dock. He also spots the statues but dismisses them as statues made to honor the heroes. Cap finds the modern world very unusual and alien but finds his way to a hotel.\nLater, Cap is awoken by a vision of Bucky, but it is revealed to beRick Jones. He has been following Cap's trail across town, looking for clues to the Avengers' whereabouts. They team up to solve the mystery and examine photos taken at the dock. Cap discovers one of the photographers carrying what looks more like a weapon than a camera, and Rick sends hisTeen Brigadeto search around the city to find the mystery man. Eventually Captain America finds the man in question and approaches him. His gang overhears his entrance and a fight breaks out. Cap easily defeats them despite being heavily outnumbered, and exposes the leader as analien. The alien, a member of the race called theD'bari, explains that his spaceship crashed into the ocean and the Sub-Mariner promised to help him return to his planet if he turned the Avengers to stone. Captain America offers to help the D'bari if they reverse the stone effect on the Avengers and he complies, freeing the Avengers once again.\nIn his palace, the Sub-Mariner angrily observes the scene and plans another tactic to defeat the Avengers. As if by luck, a troop of hisAtlantean Elite Guardpass nearby and Namor rallies them to his side.\nBack on land, the D'bari leads the Avengers to the area where his ship is stuck on the seabed below. After Giant-Man and Iron Man attach a camera to the ship's hull,Thormanipulates his hammer, causing a torrent of magnetic waves that wrench the ship free. The D'bari dives to make any necessary repairs to his ship. On the surface, Giant-Man and Captain America are suddenly attacked by Namor and his elite guard, sending them into the water. Namor duels with Iron Man, slowly gaining the upper hand. TheWaspflies in to distract Namor, giving Iron Man essential recovery time. Namor's elite guard plead for aid against the mighty Thor, who is making short work of them. Thor deflects the Atlanteans' weapons back at themselves, scattering the troops. Namor now battles one-on-one against Thor.\nMeanwhile, under the water, Giant-Man is ensnared by a massive net. However, he escapes by taking a shrinking capsule before he suffocates. He emerges near Iron Man, and they take care of the remaining Atlantean elite guard. Namor again attempts to take Thor's hammer from him, to no avail, and soon has to deal with Giant-Man and Iron Man as well. Captain America watches, trying to get a feel of what sort of team the Avengers are. The fight is brought to a standstill when some of the Atlanteans reveal a hostage - Rick Jones! With his uncanny reflexes, Cap leaps in and frees Rick and the fight begins anew.\nSuddenly an earthquake strikes the island and the Sub-Mariner leaves, believing the Avengers to be consumed by it. Little does he know, the tremors were actually caused by the launching of the D'bari spacecraft. The Avengers watch the D'bari leave and then officially offer Captain America a place on the team, which he readily accepts. Nearby, Rick looks out on the ocean deep in thought, torn between his loyalty to the Avengers, and to his old friend the Hulk."

In attendance at the banquet are the Angel, the Patriot, and Toro. During the celebrations the Torch points out that the Sub-Mariner is absent as he has been called back to Atlantis by his mother for important business. As the Sub-Mariner nears Atlantis he comes across a sea battle between Allied and Axis forces. Knowing that this will endanger his people, Namor enters the fight and sends both sides fleeing. In the aftermath of the battle, the Sub-Mariner dives down into the ocean and inspects the carnage that the conflict has wrought. Entering an underground shelter, Namor is reunited with his mother Princess Fen. Fen informs him that various undersea races are now meeting to decide how best to deal with the surface dwellers' war. He meets with a refugee princess, a woman named Rathia who fled her home in the Baltic Sea after it was subject to surface bombing. She suggests that they all rally their forces together to wage war on the surface world and take it over. She convinces Namor to support this move, using her seduction and playing on Namor's ego by suggesting that he would be a great leader of the entire world.\nNamor then contacts Casey and finds out where he will be covering the war. When Casey responds that he is covering the Russo-German front, Namor sends him a warning to avoid that region. Finding it suspicious, the Human Torch and Toro go to investigate for themselves. As the two heroes fly to Russia, Casey arrives in Moscow where he steals a soldier's uniform so he can sneak onto the front line and get a first hand account of the battle. To his surprise both sides are suddenly swept up in a massive whirlpool that floods up from the nearby water. Casey almost drowns along with the soldiers, but is rescued by the Torch and Toro. With the conflict ended, and a new danger presented Casey is reassigned to London while the Human Torch and Toro decide to seek out their sometime ally the Sub-Mariner.\nMeanwhile, Namor is happy over his first strike against the surface dwellers and Rathia plays up his ego suggesting that he has become a modern day Napoleon. When Namor spots the Torch and Toro coming to visit him, Rathia tells him that a conqueror has no friends only pawns, and so the Sub-Mariner decides to try to recruit the Torch and Toro as allies. Sweeping the flaming duo up in a whirlpool and taking them below the sea, Namor offers them a part in his conquest of the entire world. The two heroes ultimately refuse to aid him, and Namor floods the room with water. While the Human Torch manages to escape, Toro is captured. Rushing to the surface, the Torch flies over both Germany and Russia and attempts to warn them of Namor's pending attack. Both sides of the conflict dismiss the Torch's warning as an enemy trick. The Torch decides to return to London to try to get Casey to put the word out hoping the press will have a better job warning the world of Namor's threat. Along the way, the Torch stops in Africa and warns Ka-Zar of the potential threat of floods in his region. As the Torch rushes off to London, Ka-Zar begins building a massive ark to protect his animal friends from any flooding.\nMeanwhile, the Torch's warning reaches the presses and it spreads across the world. The Patriot brings the news to the President of the United States who agrees to mobilize US troops to deal with the coming crisis. While the Torch meets with the British Prime Minister for troops that he can lead in a strike against Namor's undersea kingdom. However, in attempting to tunnel their way through the ground, they are easy targets by the Sub-Mariner who uses his whirlpool device to flood the tunnel.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nTack went to Tubby's shack to ask for the return of his two chairs, curtains, rug, and table, which the latter and his friends responded by giving all of the items mentioned before shooing him away. However, Tack, then claimed that Tubby had his lantern and that they had used his canvas as a roof. Fearing that Tack would tell their mother, Tubby cooperated. Then, Tack asked for the soap box and pillow, which he they gave to him, Tubby's friend thought that Tack would ask for the lumber they had used to build their shack. Instead, Tack asked for the nails, which they gave to him out of fear of him telling his mother. Suddenly, the shack fell apart and Tubby and his friends insisted that they make Tack club president.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nThe Torch has no other choice but to save himself and seal the tunnel so that Namor does not use it to invade Britain. Going after Namor, he confronts the undersea monarch in his hide out and the two fight it out. However the fight is cut short when Rathia arrives and douses the Torch's flame. The Torch is then easily overpowered and locked in a water filled cell. The Torch is then fed drugged food that bends his will to Namor's cause. With the Torch as his slave, Namor sends him to prove his loyalty by destroying Allied forces before mobilizing a massive undersea army to launch a full out attack on the surface world.\nWhile down below, Toro - who has been locked in a water filled room since his capture earlier - has started to become delirious thanks to the onset of pneumonia. Namor has the Torch's young sidekick taken out of his cell and placed in medical care. That night as the conflicted Namor struggles with the guilt of Toro's position and his desire to rule the world, Toro awakens and in his impaired mental state manages to escape. Toro makes it as far as the British coast where he is found by a soldier and taken to a hospital. Meanwhile, Namor and his legion attack the British post on the Gibraltar. The invasion is a complete success and eventually the soldiers stationed there surrender to Namor's forces. After attacking British naval ships and Nazi U-Boats, Namor then activates one of his whirlpool devices to flood Africa. Thankfully, Ka-Zar and his animal friends are spared from drowning thanks to the ark he had built earlier.\nThe Torch has meanwhile been sent to melt glaciers near Russia, causing massive flooding in the area. While Hitler plots to change his tactics, unconcerned with the sudden freak floods the Torch snaps out of his mind control when he spots an American flag fluttering at the American embassy in Moscow.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nDuring an air raid in London an Inspector named, Horatio Crown happens upon a murder victim. He tracks down the assailant after learning the victim was a British secret agent of who was disguised as a seaman. Investigating his ship he was able to quickly determine the man who killed him was going by the name Bennet. After a brief shootout and detaining him \"Bennet\" confessed to just be using an alias and is actually a Gestapo spy that had been trailing the British agent Allan Smythe since Cape Town, Africa.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nFree from Namor's control, the Human Torch stops the continued flooding from the area and then is contacted by Casey who tells the Torch that the United States is threatened by the melting of glaciers in Canada.

The Torch briefly clashes with the Sub-Mariner, however when Namor begins to lose the battle he flees. Learning where Toro is located, the Torch pays a visit to his injured sidekick and offers to bring him to New York to get away from the bombings going on in London. Toro however is inspired by the bravery of the British people and decides to remain in London to recover.\nMeanwhile, Namor's campaign against the surface world continues as his forces attack and flood Nazi Germany, and easily overpowers their army. However when the Human Torch arrives, the Sub-Mariner and his forces retreat. They head toward the United States, sinking British fleets along the way and activate one of their whirlpool devices to flood New York City. The Torch arrives and minimizes as much of the damage as possible, and in battling Namor within the Statue of Liberty convinces Namor that he is fighting a lost cause and that Rathia will eventually betray him and take over. Realizing the folly of his ways, Namor decides to give up his aggression against the surface world and stop his attacking army. When Namor rushes off to confront Rathia alone, the Torch soon catches up with a special pipe that sucks the water away from him allowing him to turn on his flame underwater. The two destroy the last of the whirlpool devices and capture Rathia and forcing the undersea army to surrender. With the battle over, the Torch and Namor return to Britain to find Toro and find that the hospital he was staying in had been bombed and that Toro himself is among the missing, leaving the Torch to wonder if his sidekick is dead or alive.\nThis story is continued inMarvel Mystery Comics#27...\nFeatured Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nVehicles:"

The Nazis are worried that the lecture might be a cover up an investigation into the dogs that have gone missing in the area that have been pledged to the army.\nHowever, the spies cannot be any further from the truth as the pair are really intending on doing some fishing while they are in the area. However, their friend Captain Carter informs them of the disappearance of the dogs, prompting the Human Torch to decide to investigate the disappearances instead, much to Toro's chagrin.\nWhen the Torch and Toro arrive in Fairview and check into their hotel, they spot a man whose face is heavily disfigured who cannot talk. They attempt to see what they can do for him when some men warn him that the man has leprosy. After a fruitless search, the two heroes return to the hotel. There they are given an unexpected delivery of flowers, and realize too late that the flowers are emitting Lewsite gas, but the Human Torch manages to pull himself and Toro to safety before it can kill them.\nBelieving their mission to be a success, Ratter and his men begin their plot to blow up Fairview. However, Ratter realizes that the two heroes survived when they make it to their lecture which is broadcast over the radio. Furious, Ratter comes up with another scheme to destroy the two heroes. The Nazi spies attempt to gun down the two heroes during their lecture but fail and flee the scene. When questioning the audience, they learn the identity of one of the shooters and that he stays at an isolated estate on the outskirts of town.\nWhen they arrive at the Nazi hideout, the Torch and Toro overhear the spies plan on using a secret formula on the stolen dogs. Before they can act, they are discovered and attacked from behind. As the Human Torch and Toro give Ratter and his men chase, the \"leper\" they saw earlier (really a prisoner of the spies who had been blinded) decides to help the heroes out by drawing a map of the secret passageways in the secret hideout.\nWhen Ratter escapes the round up of spies, the Torch and Toro are given the map and use it to chase after Ratter. With the dogs set loose, they end up spelling Ratter's end as he and his minions prepare to fire shells with their lethal formula. When the Torch and Toro approach Ratter he attempts to toss a bullet at them, but an attacking dog causes him to drop the shell causing an explosion that kills himself and his minions.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nAnswering a call from the police, the Human Torch and Toro arrive at the scene of a murder where the victim, a bank teller, had bite marks on his throat. Examining the crime scene they find a woman's hankie loaded with perfume with a blackmail message demanding that the victim pay large ransom to someone calling themselves the White Vampire. They wonder if the attack is the work of a real vampire, but the coroner is not quite convinced.\nBack at their office doing research on vampires, the Human Torch and Toro are visited by a man named Don Pardo Kelly, secretary to the US Ambassador from a South American nation. He too has received a woman's handkerchief with a demand for money. The Human Torch convinces Kelly to follow the instructions in the hopes of catching the White Vampire when they strike. However, instead of Pardo making the delivery, the Torch puts Toro go in disguise. However, when the White Vampire arrives she sees through the ruse and douses Toro in perfume before fleeing. Recognizing the perfume as the same on the handkerchiefs they rush back to Kelly's apartment only to find him dead on the floor, the victim of another attack.\nSpotting a bat in the room, they realize that the White Vampire has trained vampire bats to attack anyone who is doused with the perfume. They follow the bat back to the White Vampire's hideout where they find the woman in a glass. There the White Vampire activates a trap door that sends the Torch falling into dungeon below, knocking him out. With Toro still reeking of perfume, the White Vampire unleashes her bats upon him, but he tricks them into flying into high voltage wires killing them.\nWith the live wires setting off explosives inside the hideout, Toro rescues the Torch and flees from the hideout as it explodes, seemingly killing the White Vampire with it.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOn the Italian battlefront, wounded American soldiers are given much needed blood transfusions with blood donated by Americans back home. However, the blood has been tampered with and all those given the transfusions end up dying. When the news reaches the States, the Human Torch and Toro get military officials to agree to let them investigate the tainted blood situation on their own.\nThe Human Torch and Toro then begin monitoring the transport of blood supplies to be shipped overseas. Along the way, they notice as one of the trucks takes a long time to come around a mountain pass and decide to investigate. Sure enough, they find a secret hideout where the trucks with inspected blood are replaced with blood that has been tampered with. Peering inside, they catch Nazis led by Herr Schmutz working away at tainting the blood. The Human Torch sends Toro to get the FBI while he deals with the spies directly. During the fight, Schmutz sprays the Torch with a thick liquid that coats his body, dousing his flames and encasing him in a hard shell.\nMeanwhile, Toro incapacitates the truck carrying tainted blood and leads the FBI to it before returning back to the Nazis hideout. There he watches as Schmutz and his men load the Torch up in another truck and leave. Toro chases after the car and forces it to crash but Schmutz manages to escape. Recovering the Torch's inert body, Toro frees his mentor and the two stop Schmutz and his men from fleeing the country in a U-Boat.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nAlong the New York coast, Nazi spies are preparing for an air raid on New York City. While in the city, the Sub-Mariner meets with naval intelligence to deal with the public apathy regarding potential air raids on the United States, and their lack of preparedness with an upcoming air raid. Namor suspects that the Nazis may take advantage of this by using submarines that can carry aircraft to attack American shores. Meanwhile, a Nazi agent known as the Cobra puts his face together to prepare to get revenge against the United States over the destruction of his original face.\nWhile at that time, the Nazis hiding out in the ocean launch missile attacks on New York. The Sub-Mariner dives into action, finding that the enemy subs launching the missiles and easily subdues the crew and turns them over to the Navy. Learning about the Nazi spy known as the Cobra, they attempt to interrogate the captured Nazi sailors but none will talk. Separating the youngest from the group they begin questioning him, but before he can give any answers he is shot in the back form outside the window. Namor is unable to catch the shooter, and they hit a dead end in their investigation.\nMeanwhile, the Cobra learns that President Roosevelt is sending a messenger to deliver a message to Joseph Stalin directly, and becomes determined to find out what the message is about. Killing the messenger and taking his place, the Cobra travels to Moscow and delivers the note directly to Stalin. In doing so he learns that Roosevelt and Churchill have asked that Stalin meet them in the Atlantic to discuss the war. Stalin accepts the invitation and the Cobra leaves to plot the three leaders assassinations.\nWhen the Cobra is picked up by an Allied plane to be returned to the United States, he drops his cover to kill the pilot and then sends a phony distress signal that their plane is experiencing trouble and he has to abandon ship. Overhearing this transmission, Namor finds it suspicious and asks the navy brass to investigate, they shrug it off as nothing more than paranoia and dismiss the possibility of trouble.\nNamor, still convinced that something is afoot returns to Atlantis and gathers an army to protect the boat containing the three world leaders from attack. Meanwhile, the Cobra returns to Germany where he informs Hitler of what is going on. The Fuehrer is pleased and orders the Cobra to lead a submarine to the location and kill the three leaders.\nWhen the enemy subs arrive, Namor and his minions attack them, and Namor boards the lead sub. There he battles the Cobra and his men and is knocked out when hit from behind and chained. However, Namor breaks free and wrecks the ship, beating the crew into submission and defeating the Cobra. After the Nazis are rounded up, Namor is commended on a job well done by President Roosevelt."

Fury#1(March, 1963)\nSam Sawyer, aU.S. Armycaptain, recruited selectU.S. Army Rangersto his \"Able\" Company. Sawyer assignedNick Furythe command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the \"Howling Commandos.\"[1]\nThe Howling Commandos, as well as their great rivals, the Second Attack Squad (the \"Maulers\", led bySgt. \"Bull\" McGiveney, with Cpl.Ricketts Johnson), and, later,Jim Morita's Nisei squad were stationed at a military base inEnglandto fight specialized missions. These missions were located primarily, but not exclusively, in the European Theatre ofWorld War II, eventually going as far afield as the Pacific Theatre,Africa, and, once each, in theMiddle Eastand on the Russian front.\nThe Howling Commandos' earliest assignment occurred in the autumn of 1942. They were to recover British rocket scientist Dr. MacMillan from a German military base in occupiedNorway. Their success brought the attention of British Prime MinisterWinston Churchill, who incorporated the unit into the British Army, and given the title of \"Commandos.\"\nAfter further training, the unit was dispatched back behind enemy lines in France to recover a Free French resistance fighter who was captured by Nazi soldiers. This was a vital rescue mission since they knew the date and time of an impending Allied landing on the beaches of Normandy. With the help of Free French resistance fighters they rescued the man from the Nazis before he could be forced to talk.[1]\nAfter seeing combat in a French coastal town, Fury was called back to base where he was informed that the Nazis were getting ahead in the race to develop an atomic bomb. Posing as sailors the Howling Commandos managed to smuggle their way into Germany to seek out the laboratory in the town of Heinemund where the atomic weapons were being developed. Initially captured, they broke free and realized the only way they could get near the lab was to allow themselves to be captured and placed into a nearby concentration camp. Breaking free, Fury and his Commandos attacked the Germany laboratory, sabotaging the scientists works there. After they fled the exposed rods of nuclear material reached critical mass and destroyed the lab in a massive nuclear explosion. It is possible that this setback is what caused Nazi leaderAdolf Hitlerto call off any further development of atomic weapons.[2]\nThe Howlers fought against the likes of German GeneralErwin Rommel[3]and inter-squad bigotry.[3]Antagonists includedBaron Strucker,[4][5]Captain America's nemesesBaron Zemo,[6]as well Adolf Hitler's protégé, theRed Skull, and other Axis villains. The Howlers were some of the first soldiers to see Captain America in action overseas when the Captain helped them to destroy a Nazi rocket research lab. They worked together so well, in fact, that the Howlers were next ordered to accompany Captain America toWakandato discover why a Nazi invasion force had been sent there[7]. The Howlers continued to encounter and fight alongside Captain America andBuckyseveral times throughout the war.[8]\nDespite being an elite squadron, they were in constant conflict with regulations due to Fury's unorthodox command style as well as their constant rivalry with McGiveney's Maulers, which caused the squad members to be thrown into the brig on many occasions.[9][10]\nThey reunited for missions in the Korean War, where Fury received a field promotion to lieutenant, and the Vietnam War, as well as at a present-day reunion gala. Several members of the Howling Commandos have also gone on to spend various amounts of time as a member of Nick Fury's current organizationS.H.I.E.L.D.[11][12]\nThe Howling Commandos later became a Delta Force C Squadron F-Team black-ops unit known for always getting the job done no matter the circumstances or consequences. InCebu City, a mission went bad resulting in the death of a member codenamedBuzzkill.[13]\nInLos Angeles, the Commandos were ordered to go after thePunisher.[14]The Commandos used the Punisher's contact,Sgt. Thomas Tuggs, as bait and eventually tracked him down to his subway hideout. The Punisher almost got away, but a tracking bullet struck him in the torso, wounding him severely.[15]\nThe Commandos then proceeded to use the Punisher's remaining family members as bait.[16]The bait worked,[17]and Punisher was captured by the Commandos;[18]however, the Punisher convinced their leader,Sidewinder, to free him and stop following orders so that he could get to the bottom ofwhosupplied theDos Soles Cartelwith U.S. Army munitions.[19]"

They also hoped to useHomo mermanusDNA but the mission to retrieve it failed. Their attempts were met with varying success.[1]\nDr. Erskine however defected to theUnited States of Americawith the help ofNick Fury, taking his work with him.[2]In the summer of 1941 his Jewish ancestry was discovered by theRed Skullwho ordered Schmitt to be taken to a concentration camp.[3]\nImprisoned by the Nazis and dying, Schmitt askedBrian Falsworthto keep the sample of the formula he had concealed on his person from falling into Nazi hands.

This article merely covers the interactions of the Imperial Japanese army that are unique to Earth-616. For a full historical account of the Imperial Japanese army, please refer toWikipedia.\nAs one of the primary aggressors during World War II, the Imperial Japanese army was featured as a major antagonist in many ofMarvel'sTimelyeras of publication with a fictional history that spans 70 years of publication. For an abridged of the history of Imperial Japan see theabridged history. An expanded membership of the Imperial Japanese army can be foundhere\nThe Empire of Japan would not be overly active in undermining American interests during this period. However, in August of 1940 they would send spies led bySatokata Matsuto commit acts of sabotage and steal the plans for a supposedly unsinkable warship. This plot would be thwarted byMerzah the Mysticand his associates. Ultimately, while attempting to flee Merzah, Matsu would end up in a fatal car accident and his minions would be arrested.[1]\nIn March of 1941, Imperial Japan attempted to dig a tunnel from between Japan and Alaska. This plot would be discovered by the Sub-Mariner after he ruined a similar plot orchestrated by the Nazis.[2]Namor, with the assistance of the Human Torch found and destroyed this tunnel.[3]\nLater, in June of '41, Japanese spyMatzuwas smuggled into the United States to undermine efforts by Chinese immigrants in New York to collect money for the Chinese war effort. This effort would be stopped by the Human Torch and his partnerToro.[4]That same month, as theYoung Alliesfled across Asia with British Agent Zero to protect a secret code, they were briefly opposed by agents of Imperial Japan.[5]\nBy August of that year, the Japanese targeted American ships off the coast of Hawaii with their giant vessel theDragon of Death, piloted by Captain Okada. Okada would be slain and his massive submarine sunk byCaptain AmericaandBucky.[6]That same month, Nazi operativeDame Kacklesmuggled Japanese spies into New York. This operation was foiled by theDefenderand his sidekickRusty.[7]\nIn September, Imperial Japan sent its agentFangto stop Chinese ambassadors from collecting war loan from the United States in Washington D.C. Once again, Japanese efforts were foiled by the Captain America and Bucky.[8]\nUS Lieutenant Curtis learned of Imperial Japan's efforts to ally themselves with the Philippines in December of 1941. In order to stop Curtis from reporting this to his superiors, Japanese spies would send Philippine assassinGinaldoto silence him.[9]This effort would be opposed by thePatriot, ending in Ginaldo's capture.[10]\nOn December 7th, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Tipped off by the attack, the Human Torch and Toro were dispatched to help stave off the attack. However the attack caused massive casualties and caused the United States to officially enter the war.[11]On the following day, the Torch and Toro attacked Japanese subs in retaliation. Between December 11th the Sub-Mariner got permission from the Untied States Navy to attack Japanese forces with his army ofAtlanteansNamor tracked down Japanese battleships and softened them up for American forces to finish off.[12]\nDuring the start of 1942, the Japanese stepped up their aggressions towards the United States and combat broke out across the Pacific. A trade embargo placed on Japan by the United States led to theBlack Dragon Societystealing oil from the United States and shipping it to Japan. The society were stopped and their operation smashed by the Human Torch and Toro.[13]\nBy the spring of 1942, Japanese spyMoppinothrough the Sun Temple attacked New York with an \"Atom Expander Ray\", destroying the Statue of Liberty and Government Island before being stopped by the Torch and Toro. As they attempted to flee in a Japanese sub, it was sunk by the two heroes and Moppino and his men drowned. While on an island out on the Pacific,Mysto the Magician, a Japanese spy, captured a high ranking military official but was foiled by Captain America and Bucky who also stopped an air raid on the base where they were stationed.[14]A Japanese spy calling himselfAgent Xalso hired jewel thiefYo Janarto steal diamonds used in factories to make weapons, but this plot was stopped byFather Time. After this Agent X was stationed in a massive battle ship disguised as an island to destroy American ships. His base was destroyed by the Human Torch and Toro. Instead of facing capture, Agent X jumped onto an enemy bayonet when brought to Australia as a prisoner. Also at this time, the Japanese constantly clashed with the Sub-Mariner. When Japanese forces wiped out opposition on Wake Island and captured many American soldiers including the brother of police womanBetty Dean. Her brothers were rescued by the Sub-Mariner who smashed the operation on Wake Island. ChasingColonel Yamato Guam, Namor would defeat Japanese forces there with Yama being killed in the confrontation.[15]When Japanese forces attempted to invade Australia, their efforts were hampered by the Sub-Mariner until Allied Forces could arrive and destroy the rest of the fleet. Japanese agents on the island of Manila then captured spy Gi-Gi Devens, but the Sub-Mariner came to her rescue wrecking their operations there as well. While stateside Japanese spyHutsuused a sleeping cult to get secrets from government agents, this plot was foiled by theAngel, Hutsu committed suicide rather than face capture.[16]Also during this period, Japanese warlord known asThe Khanattempted to invade Alaska through a secret tunnel under the Pacific, but was thwarted by theYoung Allies.\nIn May of that year,Hugh Bradleyan expert on Native Americans betrayed his country by allying himself with Japanese spies. He devised the identity of \"The Vulture\", attacking American convoys until stopped by Captain America and Bucky.[17]Also during this time Japanese agents in a zeppelin dropped their flesh eating protoplasmic creature called theJelly Manon New York City. The creature and the spies were all destroyed by theVision; andNazispyGondorused his San Francisco funeral home as a staging ground for smuggling Japanese saboteurs into the country. Smuggling them into the US through the coffins of dead American soldiers. This plot was exposed by the Angel.[12]\nBy the summer, Japanese scientistDr. Hideko Togusynthesized a formula that transformed him into a vampire. He then went to the United States to slay high ranking military officials until he was slain by Captain America and Bucky.[18]While out in the Pacific,Captain NitsuandAdmiral Nippoplanted false submarine periscopes in the ocean to make American ships waste ammunition. When the plot was learned by the Sub-Mariner, he captured Nitsu and Nippo and turned them over to the Americans and then gave the Japanese a taste of their own medicine.[19]While this was going onEmperor Hirohitotraveled to Berlin, Germany, to meet withAdolf HitlerandBenito Mussolinito discuss the state of the war. Their meeting was briefly interrupted by theVictory Boyswho came to the rescue of one of their own captured by the Nazis. During the encounter, Hirohito was insulted by the young heroes. While in Panama, an American base off the Panama Canal was attacked by Japanese forces. This attack was fought off in part thanks to the fast action ofSargent Jeff Dix. He later saved his friend and Navy cookFish Face Fridayfrom a Japanese assassin who sneaked aboard their vessel.[20]\nIn June of 1942, Japanese subs disguised as sharks attacked an American port in Santa Cruz, but the operation was foiled by the Vision and an American anti-espionage agent who helped sink the master sub out in the Pacific. While at another portthe Patriotdestroyed acrab shaped subused by Japanese agents to sink American ships.[21]The Patriot once more clashed with Japanese forces in July of that year, when he had learned that a prisoner exchange was going to be a double cross. Smuggling himself into Japan, the hero destroyed the Japanese vessel before fleeing back to the United States.[22]In August, Japanese spyAh Kneeinformed his superiors of a supply convoy traveling through the Chinese mountains. This convoy was attacked, by the attack was stopped by theFighting Yankand Ah Knee committed suicide to avoid capture.[23]While on a remote island near Australia, a Japanese scientist used an evolution ray to change lizards into high evolvedApe-Men, and also captured Jeff Mace, and his reporter friendsJack CaseyandMary Morgan. Before the scientist could use the evolution ray on them, Jeff (as the Patriot) instead turned it on the scientist, devolving him into a lizard and used it to stop the Ape Men from attacking Australia by restoring them to their natural evolution. While in San Francisco, boy detectiveTerry Vance, his pet monkeyDr. Watsonand reporterDeadline Dawsonwere captured by Japanese spies and put aboard a remote control sub to attack San Francisco while they also attacked San Diego. Terry and his friends managed to turn the sub around and send it crashing into the Japanese ship, destroying it and killing the crew.[24]\nBy the fall, the so-calledMock Mikadotraveled up from Mexico with Japanese forces to invade the United States as part of a decades old plot to rule over the United States. His invasion plans were ruined by Captain America, Bucky and the United States Army. While in Los Angeles, Japanese spyProfessor Gojomanaged to trick American authorities into thinking he was loyal to the United States while plotting an air raid onCalifornia. The plot was exposed by the Sub-Mariner who led the US Navy in destroying the island where Gojo's forces were stationed.[25]Another invasion attempt through the California coastline was assisted by the Nazi agent known as theOwlwho had Japanese invaders pose as actors in a movie about the Young Allies. The plot was exposed an the Japanese invaders were wiped out by the Young Allies, Captain America and the Human Torch.[26]\nSeptember saw Captain America and Bucky invade Japan to destroy a massive cannon that could launch shells across the Pacific Ocean. There they rescued their spy friendBetty Rossand destroyed the cannon, killing thePawthe Japanese agent who invented the device in the process.[27]In October, the Japanese began focusing onIndia, attempting to start an invasion by convincing local Indians to clear the beaches with their elephants. This plot was thwarted by the Sub-Mariner with the help of a native namedMabu. While Japanese forces landing in New Guinea learned that the local natives were not friendly to them as promised by their Nazi allyColonel Zinzerwas they had been convinced otherwise by the Patriot.[28]By November Japanese spies in India convinced theFakirof a Indian tribe to attack American forces on patrol there. This plan was stopped by Captain America and Bucky.[29]A Japanese spy posing as an Indian ambassador flying from Australia to India to be begin an attack on Australia briefly captured Jeff Mace, Mary Morgan and Jack Casey. He was stopped and the invasion foiled by the Patriot. While back in the United States, Japanese spyMarvello the Mysticused his hypnotic powers to get his victims to steal secret plans until his operation was exposed by the Angel.[30]\nOne year after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese continued to feel the sting of American forces when a Japanese Zero fighter gunned down the best friend of American fighter pilotDoug Johnson. Deciding to dedicate his life to \"Busting\" Japanese forces, he posed as a Japanese fighter pilot and helped destroy a hidden Japanese airfield.[31]\n1943 saw less clashes with Japanese forces by notable super-humans and military forces. In the winter of 1943, a Japanese naval force had setup in a canal and used it as a strategic advantage over American ships passing through. Those ships sunk had their supplies stolen and the surviving soldiers placed into concentration camps to starve to death until the operation was smashed by the Sub-Mariner.[32]By this time, Japanese agents who had set up a secret base in Death Valley deployed their specially constructed aircraft to attack American bases until they were destroyed by the Human Torch and Toro[33]and in the pacific theLaughing Death Patrol's gas attack on American fighter planes was destroyed by Jap Buster Johnson.[34]Nazi agent theKnifeattempted to assist Japanese soldiers on Guadalcanal by posing as an American infantry man until he was exposed by the Sub-Mariner. Imperial Japanese scientistDr. Sukismuggled himself into the United States to perform experiments there. He injected a serum in American soldiers, turning them into obedient slaves which he used to attack other Americans. He was ultimately stopped by the Sub-Mariner.[35]\nIn the spring of '43, Japanese agentKuhomaiattempted to avenge his father's death and disgrace by assassinatingGeneral Douglas MacArthurbut the plot to blow up the military base that MacArthur was visiting was thwarted by Captain America and Bucky.[36]Also during this time a plot by Japanese forces using decoy icebergs to sink American fleets is foiled by the Sub-Mariner.[37]While a tunnel from Japan to the United States overseen by theSerpentwas destroyed by the Young Allies.[38]While back in the Pacific, an American gunman named Dillon betrayed his troop to maintain his Japanese loyalties to his mentorSagoyo. This betrayal is avenged by Jap Buster Johnson who eliminates both men.[39]\nBy the summer of that year Hirohito along with his Axis allies Hitler and Mussolini agreed to help fund theToro's attempt to eliminate Captain America and Bucky, and attempt that ended in failure. The Japanese also found allies from theBirdmen of Pa-Pi-Ru-Guaand operated out of their tribe located in a dormant volcano until the entire area was destroyed by Captain America and Bucky.[40]Japanese agent theWhiplater stole the designs for a device to test demolition explosives. This brought them all the way to Tokyo where they were once more captured by the Imperial Japanese army. They broke free with the plans, landing another humiliating personal defeat to Hirohito, and leaving the Whip to commit suicide for his failure as they fled back to the United States.[41]While Japanese agents who traveled toShangri-Lato steal thePillow of Life and Deathto gain immortality for Hirohito were wiped out by the Vision[42]and an attempt to blow up an American aircraft carrier along the coast of New Guinea was foiled by Jap Buster Johnson.[43]\nThe fall of that year saw increased clashes with super-humans and Imperial Japanese forces. Japanese agentKiotooperated from an island in the Pacific and tortured American soldiers and dumped their dead bodies to taunt American military officials until he was shut down by Captain America and Bucky.[44]Another island of natives enslaved by the Japanese was also liberated by Captain America and Bucky when they exposed an impostor posing as their medicine manTu-Ra-Bi-Ka.[45]While in the United States Terry Vance and Deadline Dawson exposed \"Chinese\" dry cleanerRuby Yenas a Japanese spy, and in China the Vision rescued American attaché from Japanese soldiers before he could expose secrets he was going to share with Chinese General Kai Shek.[46]\nDuring this period, Hirohito personally saw to his agentYokobeing equipped with an outer shell of a American freighter so that he could decoy his submarine into American convoys and sink them. This plot was successful until uncovered and Yoko and his crew slain by the Sub-Mariner. While stateside, Japanese agents in California's many internment camps used tunnels constructed before the war to sneak out of the camps and signal Japanese bombers until they were exposed by the Sub-Mariner and Betty Dean.[47]Also, the Japanese stole a shrinking ray that allowedGeneral Nikkito smuggle the \"Cylinder of Doom\" (a canister containing an entire battalion shrunken in size) to launch an attack on American soil. This plot was foiled by Captain America and Bucky. While the Japanese lost Isabelle Island in the Pacific when Jap Buster Johnson disguised himself as a native and learned that the Japanese were using firecrackers during battle to make it sound like they had more machine gunners than it appeared.[48]\nWhen an Australian national known as theKangaroooffered to give the Japanese his formula that could convert human blood into gasoline they refused to accept it until he eliminated Jock Jordan, his former business partner and the only other man who knew of the formulas existence. Although the Kangaroo succeeded in eliminating Jordan, he was infected with his own formula battling the Human Torch and Toro and his notes were destroyed. While Death Valley was once more the scene of Japanese activity whenSaber Toothsprung his fellow spies from a local internment camp to stage an attack on the United States until they were all eliminated by the Sub-Mariner.[49]\nAs the year came to a close Captain America and Bucky helped maintain the cover ofMother Wonga Chinese spy who infiltrated a high ranking position in the Japanese army. The pair of heroes also stopped an army of suicide bombers calling themselves theSymbol of Doomfrom blowing up American infrastructure. While the Human Torch and Toro stopped the Japanese loyalist theBeetlefrom unleashing an army of Japanese Beetles biologically engineered to have poison bites.[50]While at this time the Sub-Mariner foiledBaron Togi's attempt to lure American ships into Papua Harbor with decoy ships so that they could be destroyed by Japanese subs.[51]\nWith the United States increasing the number of bombing attacks such as Operation: Doolittle, the Japanese built a decoy version of Tokyo while concealing the real village. The truth was discovered by Jap Buster Johnson. Also at this time a Japanese scientist namedNichihas begun creating massive sea monsters to attack American ships. This operation was destroyed by the Sub-Mariner, killing Nichi and his experiments.[52]While in the United States, Japanese spyNogatmiposed as Chinese religious leader Ching-Toy amassing loyal followers from local drug addicts and convincing them to commit acts of sabotage. His operation was taken down by Captain America and Bucky. While out in the Pacific, the Sub-Mariner was captured by Japanese forces and put on display byHideki Tojohimself. Namor managed to break free and land Tojo a humiliating defeat before returning to the sea.[53]In India, a female Japanese spy posed asPrincess of Ramasi, leader of a cult worshiping the goddessKaliin order to turn Indian Diacots against the American forces in the region.

But when it miraculously came back to life, Michael discovered he had some type of raw control over magic. After finishing college, Michael was recruited byS.H.I.E.L.D.in its experimental magical division, but when it looked like he would be drummed out for a lack of useful powers, he metVetis, whom he sold his soul to in exchange for a magical book. He then abandoned S.H.I.E.D. in hopes that he could \"restore\"America, which he believed was on the border of chaos.[3]\nAs the Necromancer, Michael used some new knowledge of magic in order to bring all the formerPresidents of the United Statesback from the dead in order to restore the country. Unfortunately, the magic he used caused the undead Presidents that he summoned to be corrupted and super-powered, with a desire to destroy the entire nation and start it again from nothing. Michael was forced by zombieGeorge Washingtonto use his magical abilities to create an army of the undead, in order to help Washington destroy theUnited States of America.[4]\nMichael was rescued byDeadpooland delivered toDoctor Strangeand S.H.I.E.L.D., to whom he confessed his regret for what he did, and decided to cooperate with them in order to fix the problem he had caused.[3]\nWhen the zombie George Washington attacked theS.H.I.E.L.D.

Elected to four terms in office, he served from 1933 to 1945 and was the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Presumably, the fictional character's history is mostly the same as his real life counterpart. The scope of this article is to cover the activities of the fictional character and his interactions in theEarth-616universe. For a full history of the real life FDR, consultWikipedia.\nAs early as 1939, before the United States officially entered into the war, Franklin Roosevelt kept interested in theNaziswar machine was creating. Hearing of the Nazi'sProject: Nietzsche-- an attempt to create a super-soldier -- Roosevelt had money secretly invested in attempts to create super-humans as well. Among these wasPhineas Horton'sinvention of theHuman Torch. While meeting with officials aboard the yacht owned by his millionaire friendVincent Astor, Roosevelt learned of the implications of the android, that it would burst into flames, and also of the Nazis's latest operation: dropping depth charges into theSargasso Sea.[2]\nSoon super-humans began cropping up all over America, fighting Nazi spies and other menaces seeking to destabilize the United States before the country entered the war. The first recorded encounter that Roosevelt had with these so-called \"Marvels\" was when he congratulatedProfessor Philo Zogolowskifor using his robotElectroto defend America fromZombiescreated byDr. Bruno Varoz.[3]Roosevelt later personally thanked theSub-Marinerfor destroying a fleet of Nazi battleships.[4]\nLater that year, the United States government began their own version of Project Nietzsche calledOperation Rebirthto create an army of American super-soldiers. OnSeptember 14, 1940in a secret meeting with state officials, Roosevelt sanctioned the creation of a robot calledTESS-Onea robot constructed to eliminate super-soldiers that might go rogue, before the project was put underway.[5]\nOn Roosevelt's birthday, he became a target of Nazi spies who sent him the bodies of military officials who were shrunk to doll size. Learning of this, theTerrortracked down the Nazis and shut them down.[6]\nWhen Project Rebirth yielded the creation ofCaptain America.[7]Roosevelt met with the new hero, awarded him with a new costume and shield before introducing him to the press.[8][9][10]Roosevelt also later introduced Captain America's new partnerBuckyto press as well. During this conference, Roosevelt was captured by the Sub-Mariner who wrongly accused the United States for the wars toll on his people. Roosevelt convinced Namor of his nobility and eventually both the Sub-Mariner and Captain America fought off a Nazi sub before returning Roosevelt to the White House.[11]Later, Roosevelt commended Captain America and Bucky for stopping the Nazi spies known as theUnholy Legion.[12]\nSoon after, the Sub-Mariner rallied with other undersea races to renew aggressions towards the surface world. In response, Roosevelt mobilized American troops to deal with the threat, but ultimately, Namor was stopped by the Human Torch.[13]\nOnNovember 22, 1941another attempt to assassinate Roosevelt was thwarted by Captain America and Bucky.[14]\nFollowing the attacks onPearl HarborbyImperial JapanonDecember 7th, 1941, the United States' formally entered intoWorld War II. President Roosevelt stood in theUnited States Congressand proclaimed December 7, 1941, \"a date which will live in infamy\".[15]He later called a meeting withBritishPrime Minister;Winston Churchill.[15]\nEarly in 1942, President Roosevelt hosted Churchill's extended visit to the United States and Canada to discuss the ongoing war effort.[16]Later that year, when the majority of theInvaderswere put under the hypnotic control of theRed Skull, Roosevelt was briefed of the situation by theFBI. WhenBuckyforced an audience with the President, he asked for assistance in rescuing his friends. However, Roosevelt discouraged the boy from taking action, telling him that war was no place for a youth.[17]Bucky eventually proved Roosevelt wrong by not only forming theLiberty Legion,[18]and rescuing the Invaders.[19]\nOnJune 19, 1942, Roosevelt and Churchill met once again for a private meeting about the war effort. The Invaders were on hand to protect the two leaders from an attack by two Nazi agents using an experimental growth formula.[20]Their one-on-one meetings carried on untilJune 22ndof that year.[21]\nLater that year, when American ambassadorJohn Lissamwas revealed to be the Nazi spy known as the Creeper, President Roosevelt stepped in to sign a treaty between the United States and the nation of Alslavia, one of the last few neutral countries during the war.[22]\nWhen seven good will ambassadors destined to the South American nation ofBonarawere murdered by theAmbassador of Terror, Roosevelt sanctioned theYoung Alliesto go in their place, succeeding in security a trade deal to export rubber from the country.[23]Roosevelt later sent an official directive sending Captain America and Bucky to Hollywood, California to investigate Axis sabotage at Democracy Pictures, where a serial about Captain America was being filmed.[24]\nRoosevelt soon became the target of a series of assassination attempts in 1943. The first was plotted by Nazi agent theCobrawho sought to eliminate Roosevelt, Churchill andJoseph Stalinduring a meeting out in the Atlantic. This plot was foiled by the Sub-Mariner.[25]The next attempt was by Nazi assassinJorgen Kline, who attempted to kill Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin during a meeting in Tehran. This second attempt was soiled byNick Furyand hisHowling Commandos.[26]\nYet another plot by Nazi spies was foiled by thePatriotin 1944.[27]Later Roosevelt personally greeted the Howling Commandos during a Heroes Welcome ceremony during one of the groups brief returns to the United States following a mission behind German lines.[28]\nWhen in a meeting in the West Indies, Roosevelt became a target of Nazi scientist theZombie Masterand his army ofZombies. This assassination attempt was prevented by the Sub-Mariner.[29]Later, when alighthouse keepers attendantobtain a meteor fragment that could be used as a destructive weapon and offered it to the highest bidder, Roosevelt suspected that the Nazis and the Japanese might use trickery to obtain the weapon. To prevent this, Roosevelt sent Captain America and Bucky to insure that if the weapon did not end up in American hands, it was to be destroyed.[30]\nWhen Captain America was captured by the Red Skull andWarrior Woman, military officials met with Roosevelt to explain the situation. With the risk of Captain America being killed and his death being used as Nazi propaganda, Roosevelt agreed to a secret plan that would see a man of similar physical characteristics take up the role of Captain America so that his death could be denied and Americans not lose faith.[31]While this protocol was not used during Roosevelt's Presidency it was later used when Captain America was believed to have been killed.[32][33][34]When Cap was returned, he and Roosevelt soon held a press conference with the media.[35]\nShortly before his death in 1945, Roosevelt and his wife Elanore listened to the Masked Raider radio program.[36]\nOnApril 12, 1945Franklin Roosevelt died from complications due to a stroke. When Captain America and Bucky learned of the news, Cap suggested that they wait until the war was over before they mourned the passing of the President, and draw inspiration from his life to win the battle.[9]Roosevelt was succeeded by Vice PresidentHarry S. Trumanwho took up the Presidency following Roosevelt's death and led America through the reminder of the war."

Hortonwas a brilliant scientist whose legacy is the creation of the originalHuman Torchandroid. Despite creating one of the most legendary heroes ofWorld War II, he would be a man who would live in obscurity due to his obsession of obtaining fame.\nHorton's earliest recorded appearance was circa 1929 when he moved to the town of Timely, Wisconsin to work forVictor Timely Jr.(who in reality was time traveler Kang the Conqueror). There Horton would use the advanced technology available to him to create a solar gem, which he would utilize to power his creation of synthetic humans, as well as the \"Horton Cell\" the basic building block of artificial life.\nHe would later work withFred RaymondandJames Bradley. The former to develop fireproofing methods and the latter create a synthetic body. His research would be secretly funded by the government, however, they would pull out helping Horton and Bradley would leave with a prototype they were working on.[6]\nDuring the 1939 World's Fair, Horton hope to unveil his newest creation asynthezoidcalled the \"Vision of Tomorrow\" before the press. However, a flaw would spark due to a problem with its thermogenic cells that dealt with the incredible heat it generated. In the confusion,Kenneth Laumer, as spy for the Nazi's would steal the solar gem from the robot.[7]\nWeeks after this incident, Horton unveiled his project to the press in New York calling his creation the Human Torch. When he showed to the gathered press that his creation would burst into flame when exposed to oxygen, they published the story and a combination of public outcry, pressure from theScientists Guild, and a presidential order[8]forced Horton to seal his creation in an airless cylinder sealed in cement.[9]Horton, not wishing to give up on his experiment had it to learn through education tapes until a crack in the cement caused air to leak in[10]and the Torch freed himself. When the Torch was blamed for destroying awarehouseowned by the Acmen Warehouse, Inc. Horton accompanied the police in investigating. Witnessing as the Torch gained control of his flame after being exposed to nitrogen, Horton learned that the Torch was manipulated by criminalTony Sardo. The Torch was cleared of all charges, and released into Horton's custody. However, when the Torch learned that Horton only sought fame and fortune, he departed to seek a crime-fighting career.[9][11]\nFirst appearance of Prof. Horton\nIn thesummer of 1942, Horton was working for the United States government when he was targeted byAdolf Hitlerwho had thePythonbroken out ofAlcatrazin order to use Horton to either destroy or control the Human Torch. To this end, the Python forced Horton to lead the Torch into a trap in which the hero was trapped in the cylinder he was first created in. Exposing him to the device caused the Torch to become a massive flame creature loyal to the Python. Horton aided theSub-Marinerand the Torch's sidekickToroin stopping the Python and restoring the Torch to normal.[12]In 1943, Horton sought the Torch and Toro's aid in protecting his nieceDorisfromNazispies as she was smuggling a list of the spies names back from Sweden.[13]\nHorton convinced the Torch to return to working with him after restoring the Torch's skin after it was destroyed battling anOperation: Re-Birthexperiment gone wrong. Realizing Horton was still only looking for fame, the Torch departed and burned down Horton's lab, but the scientist survived.[14]\nMuch later, Nazi scientistSigmund Fellwould reverse engineer the solar gem technology stolen by Kenneth Laumer years earlier creating the Gremlins for Nazi Germany. Horton would enlist the aid of the Torch and other wartime heroes into destroying the Gremlins, destroying all but one. Horton would not divulge to the Torch that the Gremlins shared a lineage with him.[15]\nStill seeking fame with his inventions, Horton would attempt to create yet another android,Adam II. However, this android would prove to be evil and subdue Horton, replacing him with an android duplicate. Adam II would plot to replace politicianJohn F. Kennedywith an android duplicate as part of a bid to take over the world. This plot would be discovered by the Human Torch and his partnerTorowho would free Horton and destroy Adam II and his android minions with aid from the newly formedAll-Winners Squad.[16]\nPhineas would sire a daughter, who produce a granddaughterVictoria Anderson, although he would not get acquainted with his granddaughter until recent time.[17]The identity of his daughter, and her biological mother remains unrevealed. Whatever the history may be, Horton either divorced, separated, or was estranged from this woman as he would soon get into a relationship withLanette Rayeand marry her, taking up the name Thomas Raye. When Lanette would die a year later leaving Phineas would be left to raise her daughter from a previous marriage,Frankie, he would eventually develop alcoholism.[2]\nWhen Frankie was 14, the heroicFantastic Fourrevealed themselves publicly and Horton was furious to learn that it's youngest memberJohnny Stormtook on the mantle of Human Torch, thinking it an insult to the original (who had seemingly perished in the 1950s). He would become determined to create a new Human Torch android, and enlist young Frankie to help him. Taking her to a warehouse where he kept a great amount of his equipment they worked until a chemical was spilled on Frankie giving her the ability to burst into flames. Horrified by this, Horton would hypnotize Frankie into forgetting the incident, develop a fear of fire, and would leave her to raise herself sending money and correspondence as well as a costume that would be absorbed into her skin that was fireproof -- something he also hypnotically made her forget.[2]\nWhile in hiding, Horton would learn that one of the Gremlin androids from the war had survived, and would record a message in a solar gem and leave it to his granddaughter Victoria hoping that should he die before the Gremlin became a threat, one of his previous creations could stop its menace on his behalf.[15]\nMoments before his death\nBy this time, Horton would be residing inStamford,Connecticutliving near poverty as a simple repairman and delving further into depression and alcoholism. He would be kidnapped by the mad robotUltron-5who would seek to force Horton to revive the recovered body of the Human Torch (actually a temporal duplicate created byImmortus). He would rebuild the Torch into a new form. However, when he would refuse to reprogram the Torch's mind, Ultron would slay him.[3]\nThe reprogrammed temporal duplicate of the Human Torch would become the heroicVisionwho would become a long-standing member of the heroicAvengers.[18]The body of the original Human Torch would be recovered by theWest Coast Avengersand continue to operate as a hero for years.[19]Frankie Raye would romance Johnny Storm, remember her abilities and ultimately become a herald ofGalactus.[20]Victoria Anderson would end up going to Penn State, and when the Gremlin would target the Vision, she would aid him in destroying it.[17]\nThe chronal duplicates of the Human Torch were orchestrated by Immortus to guide the Avengers in a way he saw fit. To this end, he also had one of hisSpace Phantomspose as Horton after his death to disavow any relation between the Vision and Human Torch.[21]This ruse was not revealed until recent times.[4][22]\nSuper-Genius Intelligence:Professor Horton was a brilliant scientist working in the fields of genetics and biochemistry far beyond the standards of the mid 20th Century.[23]"

The most well-known of his shields is a disc-shaped object with a five-pointed star design in its center, within blue, red, and white concentric circles. This shield is composed of a unique combination ofVibranium, Iron alloy, and a third catalyst that has never been duplicated calledProto-Adamantium.[1]It is virtually indestructible.[2]It is as much an offensive weapon as a defensive one for Captain America.[3]Cap uses it against his enemies, mainly, by throwing it at them and can perform mind-bogglingly impossible tricks with it.\nWakandan metallurgist Daniel Agobje created the shield as failsafe against the organization his mother ledOuter Circle.\nThe shield was cast by Agobje. Daniel Agobje  combined Vibranium with an iron alloy and created the disc-shaped shield. Agobje's coworkerMyron MacLainwas never able to duplicate the process due to his inability to identify a still unknown factor that played a role in it.[1]The shield was awarded to Captain America by the government several months after the beginning of his career.[3]\nThe alloy was poured into the shape of a disc with concentric circles and a star symbol. Dr. Agobje chose the design because of he intended to use the symbol of the Outer circle against them. Later, the shield was presented toCaptain AmericabyPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt.[3]\nFDR presents the shield to Captain America\nLater, Dr. MacLain's attempts to duplicate the shield, minusWakandanVibranium and the mystery factor, resulted in TrueAdamantium. Because of this historical link, the unknown substance composing the shield is sometimes referred to as \"Proto-Adamantium\".[1]\nThe shield was onSteve Rogerswhen he crashed in the arctic and was frozen in a state of suspended animation. After being revived by theAvengers,Tony Starkmade several electronic and magnetic improvements upon the shield, which allowed Rogers to control the discus in flight. The additional components threw off the balance of the shield when thrown, however, and Rogers soon removed them.[4]\nIn Cap's early adventures with the Avengers, the shield appeared to be destroyed a number of times, only to appear whole again in time for the next adventure. It was later explained that the curious Stark had frequently borrowed the unique shield for analysis and provided a steel replica for Cap to use each time. The true shield was once slightly dented by an enraged,Odin-Force-empoweredThor, usingMjolnir, but he later reconciled and pounded out the small dent.[5]\nDuring the originalSecret Warsa portion of the shield was destroyed byDoctor Doomwho had assumed theBeyonder's godlike powers. The Beyonder soon recovered his powers and, as a side effect, released a wave of energy that produced a \"wish effect\". That is, each person onBattleworldwas able to harness a portion the Beyonder's infinite power to realize some wish. Cap's wish was to have his shield whole.[6]\nLater, Captain America lost his shield over theAtlantic Oceanand it sank to the bottom. Stark sent a crew to recover the shield, at considerable cost, and months later did manage to retrieve it (Cap used a series of steel replicas during this time). Unfortunately, the shield was dropped on the ship's deck during recovery and the once-indestructible shield shattered. After examining the pieces, Stark and Rogers discovered that its unique molecular structure had changed. A small sub-molecular imperfection, a single misaligned molecule, was introduced. With every blow the shield took, the Vibranium within absorbed more energy and the flaw propagated to other molecules until the shield's bonds were completely and spontaneously broken down. Worse still, the energies released by the Vibranium created a shockwave that spread like a \"Vibranium Cancer\", violently destroying any Vibranium it encountered. Eventually, the shockwave, feeding off each newly destroyed source of Vibranium, would reach the Great Vibranium Mount in Wakanda, resulting in a blast that could destroy the world. Rogers travelled to Wakanda with the pieces of the shield taped together, hoping he could save the world by using the remaining vibranium within the shield to absorb the shockwave. In doing so he was prepared to sacrifice what remained of the shield. However, the shockwave was first intercepted by theKlaw, who absorbed it into his own body of living sound energy. Klaw soon attacked Rogers with his augmented powers. When Cap reflexively raised his shattered shield in defense, the shards absorbed the energy, and the ultra-powerful harmonics restored the Vibranium nanostructure.[citation needed]\nFor a time, Rogers was asked to relinquish the role of Captain America and the costume and shield were turned over to the new Captain America,John Walker. During this time, Rogers acted as \"the Captain\" and used a True Adamantium shield, provided by Stark. After the two had a falling out over theArmor Wars, Rogers decided to return the shield and, instead, used a pure Vibranium shield, provided byBlack Panther. When Rogers re-assumed the mantle of Captain America, he reacquired the unique shield. As US Agent, Walker took on Rogers' Captain costume and Vibranium shield.[citation needed]\nThanosofTitanlater shattered the shield with a single blow by using the power of theInfinity Gauntlet,[7]but the shield was restored whenNebulaobtained the Gauntlet and undid most of Thanos's villainy. On another occasion the shield was destroyed by theMolecule Man.[8]\nAfter the death of Rogers, Stark buried him with a replica, placed a replica in the Captain America Museum, and offered the original shield to newly revived Avenger,Hawkeye, but Hawkeye declined. After reading Rogers' will, which asked Stark to look-after Rogers' WWII partnerBucky, now calling himself the Winter Soldier, Stark offered the shield and title of Captain America to him. After Rogers' return from death, Barnes attempted to return it to him, but Rogers declined, after seeing a future event where Barnes died and believed that keeping the title of Captain America would save him.[citation needed]\nTheSerpentshatters the shield\nBarnes carried the shield, untilSin, the daughter of Rogers' archenemyRed Skull, began calling herself the Red Skull and discovered an ancientAsgardianhammer, which made her the avatar ofSkadi, daughter of the Asgardian God of Fear,Cul Borson. Wielding immense powers and an army ofNazis, Skadi destroyed theWhite Houseand Barnes was killed, attempting to stop her. Rogers took the shield and mantle of Captain America once again, but the shield was again destroyed, after Rogers threw it at the God of Fear himself and he broke it apart over his head, with his bare hands.[citation needed]\nThe shield was later reconstructed, by Stark using the mystical Asgardian metalUrumaking it \"stronger than ever.\" The weapon-smithDwarves of Nidavellirthat helped Stark were unable to remove a crack that went across the shield and Stark offered to take the scar off, but Rogers stated that it \"gave the old girl a little bit of character.\"[9]\nCaptain America's primary weapon is his shield, a concave disk 2.5 feet in diameter, and weighing 12 pounds.[2]The shield is made of a unique Wakandan Vibranium/Iron alloy calledProto-Adamantiumthat has never been duplicated,[11]although numerous scientists have tried, sometimes achieving 99% of the shield's strength.[12]Its atomic structure is possibly unique in the universe; Molecule Man stated that although Thor's hammerMjolnirand theSilver Surfer'ssurfboardwere bound together by strange forces, the shield was even stranger.[13]Thor's statement that \"there is none other like it inallthe worlds\" implies that the shield's uniqueness extends to other dimensions likeAsgard.[14]\nThe shield has great aerodynamic properties: it is able to slice through the air with minimal wind resistance and deflection of path. Its great overall resilience, combined with its natural concentric stiffness, enables it to rebound from objects with minimal loss of angular momentum. It is, pretty much, virtually indestructible: it is resistant to penetration, temperature extremes, and the entire electromagnetic spectrum of radiation. The only way it can be damaged in any way is by tampering with its molecular bonding.[2]\nThe shield is not only even stronger than True Adamantium[15]but it absorbs a near infinite amount of kinetic energy from forces direct against it because of its Vibranium component.[16]That is why theHulkandThorcan pound it whileCapis holding it, without simply sending him into the ground or the air. Cap has also used the shield to cushion the force of impact when dropped from several stories by standing on the shield.\nThe only vulnerable component that can be affected by conventional weapons are the shield's internal holding straps; the master blade wielding mercenary,Machete, managed to once in a trick-shot throw of his blades to sever them while Cap was wielding his shield. While this made the weapon much more cumbersome to use since it forced Cap to hold it by its rim, he was able to drive off the assailant so he could replace the straps at home.[17]\nCap's first shield\nThe \"Smithsonian\" variant\nCircular shield employed from 1941 to 1949\nVariant shield depicted on the cover ofThe Avengers #4\nStandard design employed during the Silver Age\nRetconof the original shield, depicted inThe AvengersVol 1 71\nSteve's new shield after his rejuvenation byKobik\nSteven Colbert with the shield."

Presumably, the fictional character's history is mostly the same as his real life counterpart. The scope of this article is to cover the activities of the fictional character and his interactions in theMarvel Universe. For a full history of the real life Winston Churchill, consultWikipedia.\nFurther, as it has been revealed that a number of wartime adventures were fictional accounts of actual events,[1]some of the appearances listed below are as accurate as their depiction inTimely Comicspublications.\nIn 1914, asFirst Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill authorised theImperial Trans-Antarctic ExpeditionunderSir Ernest Shackleton, which led to the loss of theEndurance. Ostensibly an exploration mission, the expedition was sent to mine vibranium for British military use in the First World War.[2]\nWhen the British obtained the means of deciphering theNazicode known as \"Ultra\", they learned that the Nazis planned on bombing the town of Coventry in November. Learning this Churchill chose to do nothing, as it would have tipped the Nazis off to the fact that they learned how to decode their messages, and made the difficult choice to keep this revelation silent so that it could be better utilized by the Allies.[3]\nIn 1941 Winston Churchill addressed theBritish Parliamentfollowing theSub-Mariner's recent destruction of a Nazi air base inFrance, that greatly reduced the Nazis's abilities to bombEnglandfrom Europe.[4]Later, when the Sub-Mariner once more turned against the human race and lead an army of undersea nations against the surface world, Churchill provided theHuman Torchwith troops to help combat the menace imposed by Namor.[5]When Churchill planned a secret flight over Nazi Germany, the Nazis learned of it and attempted to capture him. Although the Nazis were initially successful, Churchill was rescued by theBlazing Skulland returned to England before anything undue could happen to the Prime Minister.[6]\nOnDecember 22nd, 1941, Winston Churchill was aboard a British battleship headed to the United States for a number of speeches to rally support for the war effort. When the ship arrived atChesapeake Bay, it was attacked by the super-powered Nazi operativeMaster Man. Master Man was opposed by the combined efforts ofCaptain America,Bucky, Human Torch,Toroand the Sub-Mariner. Following Master Man's defeat, Churchill was so impressed by the group's teamwork he suggested that they should continue to work together as a team, and named the group theInvaders.[7]\nAfter making a number of speeches, Churchill was on his way back to the England, making him a target of renegadeAtlanteanNazi operativeU-Man.[8]He and reporterBetty Deanwere terrorized by U-Man until they were both rescued by the Invaders.[9]\nOnJune 19, 1942, Churchill returned to the United States for a one-on-one meeting withPresident Rooseveltto discuss the war effort. The meeting was under guard by the Invaders who protected the two leaders from an attack by Nazi spies who utilized size-changing pills to grow to giant size.[10]Churchill continued the meeting with Roosevelt until the 22nd of June.[11]\nIn thefall of 1942,Nick Furyand hisHowling Commandossuccessfully completed their first operation together and were commended by Churchill over the radio and awarded the first squad to be titled \"Rangers\" and \"Commandos\".[12]\nShortly thereafter, an attempt byBaron Struckerand Nazi operatives to assassinate Churchill at his10 Downing Streetresidence was foiled by the Invaders.[13]\nAnother attempt to eliminate Churchill, this time by the NaziMole-Manwas foiled by Captain America and Bucky.[14]Churchill later attended a meeting with President Roosevelt and Russian leaderJosef Stalinaboard a boat in neutral waters to discuss the state of the war. They became targets of the Nazi spy known as theCobra, who was thwarted by the Sub-Mariner.[15]When Churchill later met with Roosevelt and Stalin inTehranto discuss the war he was targeted by Nazi assassinJorgen Kline. However the assassination attempt was foiled by Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos.[16]"

Inside, he decides to take a dip in one of the fish tanks and ends up nodding off to sleep while relaxing in the water.\nWhile upstairs, the Nazis who are using the aquarium for their headquarters explains to Schlus that their operation gives them view of the waterfront and allows Nazi U-Boats to deliver dynamite supplies to them that they intend to use to sabotage the city. With the operation explains Schlus orders his men to call the boats in at once.\nMeanwhile, the Sub-Mariner awakens and realizes he has slept way past his meeting with Betty and is about to leave the aquarium when he stumbles upon the spies discussing their plans.

Namor finds this suspicious.\nThe following day he accompanies another boat leaving port when torpedoes are spotted heading straight for it. Namor dives into the water and redirects it away where it explodes harmlessly at sea. Diving under the water, Namor searches for the source of the torpedos and sees that they are being fire out of the tug boat he saw the day before. Grabbing the next torpedo fired from the ship, Namor redirects it back at the tug, destroying it in a massive explosion.\nRealizing the tug boats in the harbor are controlled by Nazi spies, Namor climbs aboard the next one to deal with the crew personally. While fighting with the crew he is struck from behind and knocked out. When Namor comes around, he finds himself inside the tugboat which is really a Nazi U-Boat in disguise. With Namor bound up, the captain of the ship gloats over his plan to destroy American ships in the harbor in subs disguised as harmless tugboats when he is alerted that the supply ship is about to leave the harbor.\nThe captain of the ship has Namor tired to the torpedo he intends to fire at the American vessel. However as Namor is launched toward the torpedoes target, he manages to break free of his bonds and redirect the torpedo at the Nazi sub, sinking it.

Duckworld resembles mankind's Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. He was the son of aRonaldandHenrietta, a working class Roman Catholic couple living in New Stork. He had two siblings,TheresaandOrville.[21]As a child, he discovered an amazing potential intellect; however, he was continuously bullied by other children as a result. He eventually decided to give up on his studies, wasting his potential.[22]Further details about Howard's past on Duckworld are still unknown. Indeed, there are conflicting accounts as to the circumstances surrounding his disappearance.\nHoward vanished from his home world when the power-hungry demon-lordThog the Nether-Spawnused his demonic powers to cause the interdimensional cosmic axis to shift. Howard was dislodged from his home dimension and dropped into the middle of theFloridaEverglades onEarth-616at the site of this world'sNexus of All Realities, a place from which travel to all other dimensions is said to be possible. In an effort to set the Cosmic Axis right and return home, the reluctant Howard joined withKorrek of Ktharta, who also came from another dimension, the young Earth-born sorceressJennifer Kale,Dakimh the Enchanter, and theMan-Thing, the guardian of the Nexus. The battle against Thog ended for Howard when he fell off the other-dimensional Stepping Stones of Oblivion.[23][24][25]\nHe landed back onEarth-616in the city ofCleveland,Ohio, where he first faced the menace ofGarko, the Man-Frog.[26][27]\nHoward the Duck wanted to establish a reputation in Cleveland. As such, he sought to earn a position on the Cleveland police force by catching this mysterious farm stalker. During the investigation, he foundBessie the Hellcow, who attacked him, but Howard kept her at bay with a cross. During the fight, he used a mallet and wooden stake to seemingly end the blood-sucking bovine's hellish existence once and for all. Despite his heroism, however, Howard was still denied a position on the Cleveland police force, much to his dismay.[28][29]\nIn Cleveland, Howard first met the young life modelBeverly Switzlerwho was a captive of the costumed criminal accountantPro-Rata. Howard and Beverly escaped and began living together.[30]\nAlthough Howard attempted to live as normal a life as possible, considering that he was a talking duck on a world of human beings, he continually ran afoul of various unusual menaces including theTurnip Man,[31]Count Macho,[5]theWinky-Man,[32]Emile \"The Goat\" Klout[33]and theGingerbread Man.[34]\nHoward came to public notoriety when he became a candidate for the United States Presidency on a very minor party ticket.[35]He was even the target of an assassination plot as someone hiredDoctor Angstand his group, theBand of the Bland, to kill him. Howard defeated his would-be assassins with the help of theDefendersand they were sent to prison.[36]As it turned out, the assassination was unnecessary as the general populace refused to believe that Howard was a real talking duck, thinking of him instead as a dwarf in a duck suit. As a result, the public dismissed his candidacy as a joke.[37]\nHe continued to battle villains such as theBellhop,[38]Le Beaver,[39]Kong Lomerate,[40]theKidney Lady,[41]theRev. Joon Moon Yucand the Yuccies,[42]andRoxxon.[43]\nHis most notable arch-nemesis wasDoctor Bong. Through cleverness, persistence, and just plain good (if not dumb) luck, Howard always managed to either defeat or escape from his adversaries.[44]\nHoward went up against a hate group calledS.O.O.F.I.(SaveOurOffspringFromIndecency) who were \"trying to restore order to the world\".[45]\nWhile relaxing in his apartment Howard was attacked by a salt shaker with arms and legs on a giant housefly, but they were unable to defeat him. Dakimh and the Man-Thing arrived to ask Howard for his help and he was reluctantly transported to the Castle in the Sky over the Land Between Night and Day, where they were reunited with Korrek and Jennifer Kale. Dakimh brought them there to battle the demonBzzk'joh.[46]Bzzk'jho attacked them and Jennifer was forced to use her power to bring NAAC-P30 and 2-2 2-2, two Druid Droids that helped Howard, Korrek, and the Man-Thing stop jho. When Howard still refused to help, Korrek threatened Howard. Howard conceded when he tried to use the gun that was given to him by Dakimh and it turned out only to shoot a comedic flag. Riding Dakimh's spaceship, theEpoch Weasel, into the universe to get to jho's kingdom, the Imperium Emporium, the group escaped one of their delivery truck weapons. However, their ship was damaged, forcing them to land at the Hollywok Cantina. There they tried to find transport, dealing with real Californians and being told to speak to Big Mac about getting transport. Korrek tried to do so politely; however, he violently attacked Mac when he refused them transport, causing the real Californians to attack them. Howard managed to dispel them using the Farce through his gun, incapacitating them all. Securing a new ship, the group managed to burst into Bzzk'joh's base, the Death Store, a giant spaceship themed after a box store. There they fought through jho's armies and freed Jennifer, escaping just as the Death Store was set to explode, destroying jho and all of his followers.[47]They returned Howard toEarth-616New York, but he experienced nothing but trouble when he tried to help out a few New Yorkers[48]\nAfter finally meeting up with the cruise ship that rescued Paul and Winda, now befriended by socialite Iris Raritan, he attended her party onLong Island, where he was abducted by theRingmasterand hisCircus of Crime. Paul was shot and left in a coma, and Winda, abandoned by Paul and Iris, was apparently assaulted by a hobo.[49]After defeating the Circus of Crime Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, went his own way, as he had at the beginning of the series.[50][51]Howard then returned to Cleveland.[52]\nIron Duck\nHe battled Doctor Bong and teamed up withClaude Starkowitz, a former Vietnam vet who believed that he was related toTony Stark, the personal armorer toIron Man, and the genius behind the creation ofIron Man's Armor. Claude created for Howard a suit of Iron Man-inspired armor with springs and a built-in flamethrower, plus a device which would, hopefully, neutralize Bong's powers. Lee and Howard returned to the hospital, where Bong appeared to challenge Howard just as they finished setting up.[4]He used his bell to freeze everyone; however, it did not effect Howard who was protected not only by his armor but by cotton balls stuffed in his ears. The two engaged in a battle across the hospital, where Howard, in spite of being greatly outmatched, was able to lure Dr. Bong to the device which negated his powers. However, the device malfunctioned and Bong managed to grab Howard. With only one compartment untried, Howard opened up the armor's hip unit to find a small hammer. Remembering what happened to Bong the last time that he hit the bell on his head, Howard took the hammer and hit Bong on the head with it. The resulting peel from the bell transported both Bong and Howard away and freed everyone from Bong's paralysis. Howard and Bong rematerialized in Bong's castle, where Bong used his bell to strip Howard of his armor and removed his cotton balls. However, before Bong could finish Howard off, Beverly stopped him, showing him cloned babies that she she made and threatened to send a letter to the media, outing him as a negligent parent. Conceding and taking the cloned children, Dr. Bong angrily teleported Howard and Beverly back to the hospital. There they were reunited with Lee and Winda, who had come out of her coma.[53]\nNow living in Cleveland again, Howard battled new weird adversaries.[54]\nWhen Howard was on his way home from the laundromat, he was attacked out of the blue byDracula. Realizing Howard was not human he fled. Howard now started to displayvampire-like tendencies. He changed into traditional vampire garb and tried to attack Winda. Mistaking his bloodthirst for lust, Bev kicked Howard out of the house. The sometime-vampire hunterHarold H. Haroldcame looking for Howard and explained that his affliction was purely a disillusion. After a few failed attacks due to not having any teeth, they found him and tried to snap him out of the disillusion. Dracula arrived and tried to turn Bev into a vampire, but Howard staked him with a piece of a picket fence. Seeking immortality and listening to the dying Dracula claiming that he could give it to him, Harold foolishly removed the stake, and Dracula turned him into a vampire. Three days later, Howard read of reports of Harold clawing his way out of his grave.[55]\nHoward and Beverly on Duckworld\nHoward and Beverly arrived onDuckworldonEarth-791021. On this world, Beverly was considered the freak of the pair. Howard was eventually realized to have been the \"Drake\" who had vanished a few years back. Initially fleeing from overzealous worshipers, Howard led Beverly back to his former home, the base of the WACkies (Witness to theAscensionCult), and they learned what theRev. Godfrey Ganderhad done. Howard spoke up to the crowd, denouncing Rev. Godfrey and revealing the message that he had intended for them. Though initially reluctant, theDuckworldiansagreed to start thinking for themselves, while Gander vowed vengeance for losing his franchise. Howard worked to win his people over to Beverly, appearing with her onThe Tonight Showwith Johnny Quackson. In a \"This is Your Life\" pastiche, Howard was reunited with his parents and his sister Theresa, now a nun, and his brother Orville, now a mortician. However, the next guest,Dr. Ludwig von Cluck, actually a paid agent of Gander, attempted to use his Surrogate Sniffer super-vacuum machine to expose Beverly as a robot. It instead exposed her by tearing off all of her clothes. The appearance of a naked human appalled the Duckworldians. Howard and Beverly fled alongside fellow guest Truman Capoultry. A former ally of Gander, Capoultry wished to follow Howard's word and helped them escape. To help them return to Earth, Capoultry brought them toDucktor Strange, Mallard of the Mystic Arts, who was a drunk and living in an alley. Before Strange could do anything, the Rev. Gander,Scrounge McDrake, and their allies showed up and attempted to gun down Howard, Bev, Capoultry, and Strange. Bev kicked a trash can into their attackers, after which they overpowered them one-by-one. Strange cast a spell sending them back toEarth-616, and while Gander saw this as a chance to revive the WACkies, Capoultry vowed to write a new book telling the true story of Howard, which would foil Gander's plans.[21]\nArriving back in Earth-616, at the Nexus of All Realities in Florida, they teamed up with the Man-Thing again to battleKong Lomerate.[56]Howard and Bev got jobs at a retirement home inMiamiwhere they ran afoul of the grand designs of the Grey Panther.[6]The pair wound up inNew Orleanswhere Bev was kidnapped by theBlack Talonas an intended sacrifice of a voodoo cult.[57][58]\nHoward, working as a taxicab driver, had driven a customer to New York all the way from Cleveland. This man, calling himselfStatus Quo, was a mild-mannered librarian when the constant advent of new fads drove him to madness. Wanting to destroy all fads, Status Quo began studying how the media and advertisers help encourage fads, and came to New York in order to speak to people and convert them to his anti-fad group. This eventually led to a giant demonstration in Central Park where surprisingly, Status Quo managed to gather a large crowd and earn himself a legion of followers. These followers were armed with gimmicked fads (rocket-powered skateboards, exploding Frisbees, etc.) and sent out to attack anyone who supported any kind of fad. The chaos brought the attention ofSpider-Manwho tried to quell the mob, and prevent them from spreading beyond Central Park, while Howard was chased after by some anti-fad goons who thought he was trying to perpetuate a fad himself. Spider-Man eventually teamed up with Howard and the two managed to expose Status Quo as a hypocritical terrorist in front of live news cameras, discrediting him and causing his followers to break up. Afterwards, Howard and Spidey split up, and Howard returned to his cab where he found a police officer waiting for him to write him up on a number of traffic violations.[59]\nHoward was inSan Franciscoon Christmas Eve where he was on theGolden Gate Bridge, depressed and contemplating suicide. He was stopped by anAngelcalledAndy. Andy decided to try and boost Howard's confidence and morale; he showed Howard how the lives of its friends would have unfolded if Howard had never come toEarth-616. He showed HowardEarth-83234. They visited his friendsPaul Same,Arthur Winslow, andBeverly Switzler. To Howard and Andy's horror, all of his friends’ lives would have been better off without him. Believing that he had failed and that his life was worse than Howard's because he believed that would never get his wings, Andy considered suicide himself, but Howard succeeded in stopping him from doing so. Howard offered to buy Andy a drink rather than having either of them kill themselves. This act ironically won Andy his wings because, after all, itwasa successful mission.[60]\nHoward broke up with Beverly at her request. After that, he was mistaken for \"Duck Drake, Private Eye\".[57]He then metCeci Ryderwhen hitchhiking and battled theGopher, afterwards ending up back in Cleveland.[61]\nHoward later won 10 million dollars from the American Garden and Family grand prize contest. However, the fun and the fame changed him, causing him to lose contact with Bev. Dr. Dwight Clive convinced him to use the rest of his money to create a mate for himself. Using cell samples, he createdAlexis the Duck, but unwittingly used a brain taken from the body of the spoiled wife of a personal injury attorney. Alexis turned out to be a bitter gold digger who left Howard. Broke, he returned home to Cleveland.[16]\nThe Whoatcher had heartburn and created a cosmic burp that accidentally zappedSpider-HamofEarth-8311and Howard into an alternate dimension. They emerged onEarth-905237in the castle ofDucktor Doom. Working together they battled Doom, but the Whoatcher took some antacids, neutralizing the effects of the cosmic burp. Howard and Spider-Ham were sent home before the burp happened and disrupted Doom's weapon, which was the perfect synthesis between science and magic and with which he had intended to conquer the world. Howard felt that he got off easy, but then Ducktor Doom materialized in the alley behind him.[62]\nMeeting the She-Hulk\nTheShe-Hulkaccidentally pulled Howard through a cosmic wormhole, along with physicistBrent Wilcox, and prevented other universes from crowding outEarth-616.[63]Howard met the Critic, traveled to the Baloneyverse, and battled Dr. Angst and the Band of the Bland again.[64]\nIn California,ChamberandSkinofGeneration Xhitchhiked down a highway. After several cars flew past them, one of the vehicles stopped to offer the two mutants a ride. The driver of the vehicle was none other than Howard the Duck.[65]Howard and the mutants stopped at a bar to get some drinks, and the bartender informed them that their establishment did not serve ducks. Violence ensued and Howard was forced to rely upon his martial arts training inQuak Futo avoid injury. Chamber unleashed his mutant powers and began questioning the bar patrons about someone named Tores. To everyone's surprise,Miguela Toreswas actually a sultry young woman with a green stripe tattooed across her right eye. She entered the bar and began asking questions. While Chamber and Howard dealt with Tores, Skin sneaked away from the bar. He disguised himself as an old man and went to the cemetery to visit his own grave. There, he met his mother and managed to console her without letting on that he was, in fact, her son.[66]Outside in the Bio-Sphere, Howard and his girlfriend Bev arrived.Franklin,Artie, andLeechwere thrilled at the notion of having a talking duck to pal around with. Howard had no real interest in hanging out with children, but the kids dragged him to their treehouse. Inside they foundTana Nile. Tana was a Rigellian who crash-landed on Earth a short while ago. Leech had been sneaking her food from the school, and no one but the children were even aware of her presence.[67]Howard tried to find a way to get the children to safety.Black Tom Cassidyraided the tree house and prepared to kill them. Howard drove Black Tom back by setting him on fire with the lit end of his cigar. As the treehouse erupted into flames, Howard, Artie, Franklin, Leech, and Tana Nile discovered the Man-Thing present on the estate. Recognizing that the Man-Thing is the gateway into the dimensional rift known as the Nexus of All Realities, Howard convinced the others to dive into the creature's slimy body in the hopes of escaping. Their plan appeared to work and they disappeared inside the Man-Thing’s body.[68]\nHoward and the Daydreamers\nHoward and theDaydreamerswent sailing through the inter-dimensional byways of the Nexus, floating on a broken chunk of Earth. No one could really understand what was happening to them and Howard began to have a panic attack. Tana kept his attitude in check and reminds him that their first responsibility was to look after the children. Artie fell asleep and projected a vision of his nightmare: a dark, menacing shadowy figure. Before long, the Daydreamers arrived in a surreal fantasy world known as Nevernever-Narnozbia. Their earthen sled landed atop a woman (who looked suspiciously a lot like theScarlet Witch) known as the Red Witch of the Southeast, squashing her flat. A bunch of rocky little stone Things ran out to greet the visitors, expressing their happiness that the witch was finally dead. Suddenly, a man in drag named Strange arrived and thanked them for saving Nevernever-Narnozbia from the threat of the witch. Franklin expressed his desire to return home and Strange used the Eyeliner of Agamotto to direct them towards the King of the realm. Meanwhile, Howard the Duck was separated from the group and came upon a magic lamp. Rubbing the lamp, he summoned agreen goblin-likegenie who granted him three wishes. Howard wished for a way out of this mess, and the genie provides him with a DeSoto. Driving along in the antique car, he eventually met back up with his friends only for them to become prisoners of the King. The King bore a strong resemblance toDoctor Doom– an old foe of theFantastic Four. The Daydreamers tried to escape, and a fight broke out in the King's throne room. The dark spectral figure from Artie's vision arrived and declared that he had come for Franklin Richards.[69]\nThe Dark Hunter attacked theDaydreamersproclaiming that he had come for Franklin Richards. The Daydreamers could not decide which was stranger: the evil villain standing before them,Doctor Strangein drag, or the fact that the Man-Thing could suddenly carry on a conversation.Leechtried to siphon away the Dark Hunter's powers, but to no avail.Franklinasked Strange if he could send them home. Strange could not send them back to Earth, but instead used his magic wand to send them to another realm altogether. The group arrived in a bizarre cartoon-liked reality, which appeared as if it were crafted from the mind of Dr. Seuss. Weird creatures were seen walking down the streets with distended lips and large tufts of hair on their heads. Like the characters from Dr. Seuss, everyone had a penchant for speaking in rhyme. The Daydreamers stopped at a local diner to collect their thoughts. The staff at the diner became irate with Howard, who absolutely refused to speak in rhyme. Franklin placated the offended food servers by ordering their meals in rhyme for them. It did little good, however, as the Cadence Police arrived to arrest the Daydreamers. Howard wanted to start a fight with them, butTanaconvinced him that allowing them to be taken to jail might actually serve their better interests. Suddenly,Artiebegan to distrust Franklin. He continued to have visions of the Dark Hunter and felt that Franklin was connected to the Hunter in an unhealthy fashion. Franklin lashed out at him, declaring that he should mind his own business. Later that night, the Dark Hunter came for them. Tana Nile ripped the bars off of their prison cell and they broke free. She tried to keep the Dark Hunter at bay, but was unable to penetrate his shadowy form. Howard tried to get the Man-Thing to transport them back home, but the Man-Thing explained to him that he cannot control the power of the Nexus. Regardless, the Daydreamers dove into his slimy body and accessed theNexus of All Realities. When they exited, they found themselves onDuckworld– the planet of Howard's birth. They looked around in shock and awe as they saw a large bronze statue of Howard the Duck in the town square. To all accounts, Howard appeared to be a hero of the people.[70]\nCrowds of people began swelling around the new arrivals, eager to welcome their hero home. In an effort to keep the excited mob at bay, Tana Nile picked up the Man-Thing and began swinging him about like a baseball bat. The Daydreamers ducked down an alleyway and stealthily made their way towards Howard's home. Howard did not know why he was being hailed as a great hero and frankly, he did not care. The Man-Thing began to lose his cohesion, and Tana had to help him along. They arrived at the house of Howard's parents, June and Ward. It was an idyllic two-story home with a perfectly manicured lawn and a white picket fence. June and Ward came out to greet the newcomers and they welcomed Howard with open arms. Following a quick repast, Howard decided that he had had enough of this. He knew that this was not his true family and that his home life was never this perfect. As he shook his head in denial, the imagery washed away and all of it was revealed to be an illusion. Meanwhile, the Man-Thing continued to fall apart. Tapping into the cosmic energies of theNexus of All Realitieshad proven too taxing for his physical form and he could no longer maintain his cohesion. Before long, the Dark Hunter arrived on Duckworld and continued his pursuit ofFranklin Richards. The Daydreamers left Howard's phony household and proceeded to a place known as the Richards Institute. Inside were two-dimensional cartoon versions of Franklin's parents,ReedandSusan Richards. The Dark Hunter tracked them down and they soon realized what the Hunter actually was – he was the living embodiment of Franklin Richard's repressed emotions. When the Daydreamers first interacted with the Nexus of All Realities, it reacted with Franklin's dormantmutantpowers, creating a conduit into a pocket dimension inside Franklin's subconscious mind. Franklin never came to terms with the fact that his parents were gone – victims of the villain known asOnslaught. In his grief, he fabricated an imaginary, illusory world where he could effectively hide from his pain. Now having confronted his own fears in the form of the Dark Hunter, Franklin was finally ready to let go of his parents. As Franklin's pocket reality ceased to exist, the Daydreamers exited the Nexus of All Realities. They were back onEarth-616in the FloridaEverglades, and the Man-Thing was back to his normal, inarticulate self.[71]\nWhile the Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian of Franklin, Howard went off on his own and was captured by theCult of Entropy.[72]Although he was last seen him in the swamp, he stated that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wanted him because he had part of the Nexus of All Realities, which had shattered duringHeroes Reborn, inside him, which he knew because it was making him nauseous. The Man-Thing entered his gullet, and Howard vomited him back out with the fragment, but the former was left desiccated and practically dead.[73]\nHe then encounteredNamor the Sub-Mariner, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explained that he would not be lugging his friend's body if that were the case. Howard set the Man-Thing down in the water, and he revived during the conversation with Namor. Once he saw that the Man-Thing was alive and well, he bid Namor farewell and told him that he was returning to Cleveland.[74]\nHe worked withSpider-Man (Ben Reilly)in a fight against the Circus of Crime, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting theSavage DragonandDestroyer Duck. The group left in the belief that they had brought the correct Howard with them.[75]\nJennifer Kale attempted to return Howard home many times, but he accused her and Doctor Strange of being responsible for bringing him toEarth-616. She accidentally teleportedDevil DinosaurandMoon Boyinto her New York apartment.[76]The disoriented dinosaur attempted to eat Howard, but spat him out when he was shot with theGhost Rider'sHellfire Shotgun. They then went on a rampage through the city before being subdued by theGhost Rider. Howard related to the pair, being trapped in a world he was never meant to be in, and wandered off.[77]\nHoward got a job as a department storeSanta Claus, which got him dragged to theNorth Pole, where the realSanta Claushad sold out toHydra.[78]\nHoward the Duck in mouse form\nBeverly obtained a job at a company that was owned by Doctor Bong who turned Howard into a mouse, but the process was unstable and he cycled through different forms before settling on the mouse form again.[79]Bong joined withKenneth Floggto gain theAmulet of Pazuzu, but Howard obtained it first, gained its power, and used it to slay Flogg's assistant,Ian Whippingham.[80]They next stayed at theBoarding House of Mystery, joining their fellow tenant,Splatter Gomorrah, in exposing talk show hostIprahas a marketing franchise.[81]However, she was possessed by the angel-demon hybridDeuteronomy. Howard used the cigar of the Saint of Therapists,Sigmund Freud, to banish Deuteronomy; however, he decided to take a puff of the cigar which disintegrated him and sent him toHell.[82]He was saved byGodHimself who, grateful for him dealing with Deuteronomy, shared with Howard the meaning of life before returning him to Earth back in his duck form.[83][84]\nHoward the Duck tried to sue the directorGeorge Lucasover a film, and was represented byGoodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway.[85][86]\nAs an interdimensional non-human being, Howard was compelled to register under theSuperhuman Registration Actalong with Beverly.[7]He attempted to do so during theCivil War[87]but learned that his socially disruptive life had created so many bureaucratic headaches that the U.S. government's policy was that Howard, the so-called infamous \"Duck Man of Cleveland\", did not exist. This lack of government oversight delighted Howard: \"For the rest of my life... no more parking tickets - or taxes - or jury duty. Heck, I couldn't even vote if I wanted to! This is even better than Christmas in Vegas! I no longer officially exist!\"[7][88]\nAfter he defeatedM.O.D.O.T.'s scheme to control the public through the mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, had him registered with the government. including all relevant responsibilities and the President made him a citizen with a full presidential pardon.[89]\nAt some point, Howard was made part of theOhio Initiative, but the team was eventually shut down by the Feds for unrevealed reasons.[10]He was subsequently made an agent ofA.R.M.O.R., and was hired byMorbius the Living Vampireon a private mission to travel through the multiverses of different types of zombies and collect a sample of each one of them. Before he could go, he was to search forMachine Manand recruit him. One week after being enrolled, Howard found Machine Man drunk and depressed, for his girlfriendJocastawent back to her former husbandUltron. Howard was able to convince Machine Man to join him on their mission.[90]\nThe Fearsome Four\nDuring theFear Itselfevent, Howard formed a team called theFearsome Fourwith theShe-Hulk,Frankenstein's Monster, andNighthawkto stop theMan-Thing, who found himself driven to an uncontrollable rage caused by the immense levels of fear generated by theSerpent'shammer-wieldersacross the world.[91]Facing various alternate universe heroes and thePsycho-Man, brought to Earth by the Man-Thing's connection to theNexus of All Realities,[92]the Four were eventually able to confront their own fears and calm the Man-Thing, bringing an end to his rampage and saving the world, before going their separate ways.[93]\nCynical Duck and Swizzle\nHoward and Bev were both brainwashed and forced to work forS.O.O.F.I.as Cynical Duck and Swizzle. They promoted S.O.O.F.I. at a public speech held for them byJ. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man interrupted a S.O.O.F.I. indoctrination at theNew York Public Library, and Bev and the other S.O.O.F.I.s saw Spidey as a semi-demonic figure and attacked him. Spidey escaped with Howard and broke his brainwashing because Bev was being threatened. Howard quickly explained S.O.O.F.I.'s goals to Spider-Man. As Spider-Man publicly announced his long-standing support for S.O.O.F.I., Howard confronted Bev as she stood by theSupreme S.O.O.F.I.. Howard broke through to Bev, reminding her of their past. The leader ordered the S.O.O.F.I.s to throw the pair into the special Blanditron atGuantanamo Bay, and Bev kept them at bay with her whip. Spidey attacked them and unmasked the Supreme S.O.O.F.I., while the others escaped though their teleporter. Howard believed S.O.O.F.I. would lay low for a while after such a defeat, and also hoped their Florida Everglades base might lead them to meet up with the Man-Thing.[12]\nThe Ducky Dozen\nBecause of his experience with zombie-infested worlds and his leadership of Machine Man, Howard was chosen as the leader of, as he dubbed them, theDucky Dozen.[94]The team was comprised of himself, several Golden Age heroes,Dum Dum Dugan, andBattlestar, who was also a veteran of a zombie incident. Upon enteringEarth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fought hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffered grave losses as most of the members were either killed or zombified in battle.[95]After successfully accomplishing their mission Howard, Dugan, Taxi Taylor, and Battlestar were the only members left that had survived and returned toEarth-616along with theRiveter, the only survivor of Earth-12591's resistance team theSuffragists.[96][97]\nHoward teamed up with his friendDoopto battle Robo-Barbarians in Dimension ZZZ. They beat the horde back with nothing but a broken sword, a rubber chicken with nails in it, and a gun that shot bees.[98]\nAfter the death ofUatu the Watcherand the activation of the secrets buried in his eye, Howard discovered that he had the potential to be the most intelligent being in Duckworld. After evading a squirrel while driving, he was thrown flying and used his intellect to calculate his way to land safely in a dumpster.[22]\nHoward returned to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as theShe-Hulkin Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by theBlack Cat. With the help ofTara Tam, a new ally, Howard managed to recover the necklace, but on his way to give it back to Richards he found himself kidnapped by theCollector,[99]allied with theGuardians of the Galaxyto escape the villain's collection,[100]and confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him.\nDuring his third attempt at recovering the necklace, from the Ringmaster this time, Howard was approached by Richards, who revealed himself to be theSkrullTalos the Untamed, and explained the true nature of the stone in the necklace: it was one of the several Abundant Gems.[101]Once Talos fled the scene, Howard and Tara sought the help ofDoctor Strangeto learn more about these Abundant Gems. Joined by theHuman Torch, the heroes failed to beat Talos in the race for the final gem, and the villain made himself more powerful with theAbundant Glove.[102]In the middle of the battle, during which Tara publicly revealed his shapeshifting abilities to help fight the energy constructs that were created by Talos, Howard managed to snatch the Abundant Glove from the alien villain and defeat him.[103]\nHoward eventually set out to return to his home dimension, and traveled toFloridato find theNexus of All Realitiesin order to reach this goal. However, his attempt to use theCompassion Gemof theAbundant Gloveto help him find his way home merged him with the Nexus.[104]The fusion turned Howard into a Living Nexus which could also be used to teleport to different destinations willingly instead of randomly, as the Nexus normally acted. Howard's new-found powers caught the attention of numerous people who desired to use Howard for their own ends, including gender-bent clones of Howard andRocket RaccoonnamedLindaandShocket Raccoon, who wanted to rescue everyone trapped inCollectonand escape to another universe.\nHoward agreed to help Linda and Shocket, and on their way to Collecton, they were pursued by bothSkrullsand theStranger.[105]Howard was seemingly rescued from the Stranger's clutches byScout, a cosmic-powered girl who wanted to give Howard as a gift toGalactusand prove herself worthy of being his new Herald. With the help of theSilver Surferand theGuardians of the Galaxy, Howard's allies rescued him.[106]Using a portion of thePower Cosmicgranted to him by the Silver Surfer, Howard brought his allies to Collecton and helped both defeat the Collector and free its prisoners, who used Howard's powers as the Living Nexus to return to their homes. When Howard was separated from the Nexus and used it to return home, he was accidentally sent to the doorstep of Bev's new house.[8]Following a bittersweet and brief reunion, Howard returned to New York.[107]\nWhile investigating a case for actressLea Thompson, Howard discovered that the nefariousMojoof theMojoversehad turned him into the unwitting protagonist of his own reality show. However, in order to ensure Howard's life remained interesting for the ratings, he had hired the services ofChippandJho, two members of the race ofreality warpersknown as theSparkitects, who had subtly influenced Howard's life and been responsible for most of his recent misadventures.[108]\nThe two Sparkitects became directly involved with Howard's confrontation against Mojo after realizing that the villain could find out that Howard discovering the reality show was an attempt by them to shut down Mojo's program and cut off all ties with him. When Howard confronted Chipp, the Sparkitect stabbed and killed him.[19]However, Jho's attempt to redeem his wrongs brought Howard back to life, after manipulatingDoctor Strangeinto returning his soul to his body.\nDuckworldian Physiology:Howard's body, like those of his entire race, has similar characteristics to those of both common Earth ducks and common Earth human beings. He has hands and arms instead of wings, is covered with feathers and is unable to fly. Howard is similar to a human athlete who has trained his body to the fullest. Howard can stay alive in the space vacuum without suffering any harmful effects, even without using any type of suit that protects him from the environment or provides him with oxygen.[109][106]\nEnhanced Duckworldian Speed:After his training Howard has improved his speed, moving faster than the human eye can see.[5]\nSuper Reflexes and Precision:Howard's reflexes have been honed to the point of utmost precision, allowing him to allegedly move faster than the eye can see. He is also capable of catching a knife being thrown at him.[5]\nMystical Training:TheSorcerer SupremeDoctor Strangehas also briefly tutored Howard in the mystic ways, indicating even those of Duckworld possess magical potential.[109][110][111][112][113]Under his mental guidance, Howard was capable of conjuring theVapors of Valtorr, theShield of the Seraphim, use transformation enchantments and even utilize anotherEye of AgamottoandCloak of Levitationalong with his own garb forHoward the Duck, which the duck was able to command, despite his lack ofSorcerer Supremetitle, though ultimately declining to study as Strange's apprentice. Dr. Strange has claimed that Howard has incredible potential, making him one of the most powerful sorcerers.[36]\nLiving Nexus:Howard was temporarily merged with theNexus of All Realities, allowing him to act as a gateway to the Multiverse. When somebody touches him, he can choose where they will travel or they can make their own choice. He can also create an entirely new universe with his own specifications and can be tracked by cosmic beings and ships acting like an \"cosmic ark.\"[105]\nMartial Arts:Howard is a master in the little-known martial art calledQuak Fu, which he learned at the hands ofMaster C'haaj,[5]and hence is a surprisingly formidable opponent in hand-to-hand combat, which allows him to defeat opponents that are more powerful than himself.[109]\nWillpower:As part of his Quak Fu training, Howard reached a new state of consciousness and developed an immense willpower. Howard can use his will to break down material barriers with easy sum, apparently increasing his strength.[5]\nSuper-Fast Learning:During his martial arts training, Howard dominated the irrelevance of chronological time, giving him the ability to master a life of studies and training in just three hours and seventeen minutes.[5]"

Among those knights is Sir Percy of Scandia, the Black Knight, rode through an pagan-enriched Isle of Wight to find a tower. The Black Knight is the son of Sir Dandel, a pious converted Christian, and Lady Evaine, a pagan. At the current time, the English kingdom is at civil war between Christianity and Celtic-Saxon paganism. Which Sir Percy hoped that finding the Grail would be the final victory of the \"Faith of Rome\" that would end the bloodshed.\nAt the castle, the Dark Knight is met by a damsel in distress who request his help in freeing her home from dark magics. Which he obliged. As he enters into the castle, the \"maiden\" is reveal to be a ghoul. Inside, Percy is allure to the source of the dark magic, the infernal gospel tome of the demonChthon, the Darkhold. The tome tempted the Dark Knight claiming that the solution to the division in Arthur's kingdom and his divided soul rest inside it. Percy believed it and allowing himself to spread the Darkhold's influence beyond allowing the dead, who are intelligent, to walk and attack and killed the living.\nThe army of the Darkhold had grown to hundreds and more as they besiege Carisbrooke Castle. The army spot the appearance of Howard the Duck, Jackie Kane, and Machine Man (who is still installed to the Martian tripod). The undead attack the tripod with siege engines, one of which a ghoul attach itself to a arrow and slams into one of the tripod's legs, crippling it. Fortunately, Howard, Jackie and Machine Man direct the tripod onto the undead's siege tower and jump inside Carisbrooke Castle. The three are then surrounded by soldiers led by Lord Admiral Gervase, who is sworn to King Arthur in purging paganism throughout the kingdom. He mistakenly sees Howard as a pagan creature and order him to be put to death. However, Jackie, with her speed, hold Gervase at sword-point, convincing him that their mission is to help and find to destroy the source of the undead (known as \"Possessed Type-834\", a \"Raimi\") in exchange for the resources in repairing Machine Man. Which Jackie decided to volunteer herself in finding the source of the outbreak as her speed can get through the zombie horde.\nAfter dressing into a medieval attire and arming herself, Jackie speeds out and slashes her way through. Once outside, she is able to track the undead source at the castle where Sir Percy is. As she comes into the tower to find the Black Knight, the Darkhold tries to sway her in having her parents back. Jackie refuses and uses the Black Knight's Ebony Blade and drives it into the Darkhold, destroying the book and purifying the evil, thus ending the undead threat. Jackie helps the freed Dark Knight outside.\nLater, Machine Man is repaired at a inferior level and complains to Howard if the next dimension would provide him the necessary needs. Howard confirms that the next world,Earth-8410, is a \"Dystopia Cyberpunk\" which would provide him the technology. Howard then notice on the monitor and privately share this to Jackie, showing an alternateJocastawhich he fears this might not end well for Machine Man. As the trio left Carisbrooke Castle, Admiral Gervase is about to proceed his purge but is very shortly confronted by the Norse god Thor, who had heard the plight of his worshipers and prepares to shows his wrath."

Duckworld resembles mankind's Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. He was the son of aRonaldandHenrietta, a working class Roman Catholic couple living in New Stork. He had two siblings,TheresaandOrville.[21]As a child, he discovered an amazing potential intellect; however, he was continuously bullied by other children as a result. He eventually decided to give up on his studies, wasting his potential.[22]Further details about Howard's past on Duckworld are still unknown. Indeed, there are conflicting accounts as to the circumstances surrounding his disappearance.\nHoward vanished from his home world when the power-hungry demon-lordThog the Nether-Spawnused his demonic powers to cause the interdimensional cosmic axis to shift. Howard was dislodged from his home dimension and dropped into the middle of theFloridaEverglades onEarth-616at the site of this world'sNexus of All Realities, a place from which travel to all other dimensions is said to be possible. In an effort to set the Cosmic Axis right and return home, the reluctant Howard joined withKorrek of Ktharta, who also came from another dimension, the young Earth-born sorceressJennifer Kale,Dakimh the Enchanter, and theMan-Thing, the guardian of the Nexus. The battle against Thog ended for Howard when he fell off the other-dimensional Stepping Stones of Oblivion.[23][24][25]\nHe landed back onEarth-616in the city ofCleveland,Ohio, where he first faced the menace ofGarko, the Man-Frog.[26][27]\nHoward the Duck wanted to establish a reputation in Cleveland. As such, he sought to earn a position on the Cleveland police force by catching this mysterious farm stalker. During the investigation, he foundBessie the Hellcow, who attacked him, but Howard kept her at bay with a cross. During the fight, he used a mallet and wooden stake to seemingly end the blood-sucking bovine's hellish existence once and for all. Despite his heroism, however, Howard was still denied a position on the Cleveland police force, much to his dismay.[28][29]\nIn Cleveland, Howard first met the young life modelBeverly Switzlerwho was a captive of the costumed criminal accountantPro-Rata. Howard and Beverly escaped and began living together.[30]\nAlthough Howard attempted to live as normal a life as possible, considering that he was a talking duck on a world of human beings, he continually ran afoul of various unusual menaces including theTurnip Man,[31]Count Macho,[5]theWinky-Man,[32]Emile \"The Goat\" Klout[33]and theGingerbread Man.[34]\nHoward came to public notoriety when he became a candidate for the United States Presidency on a very minor party ticket.[35]He was even the target of an assassination plot as someone hiredDoctor Angstand his group, theBand of the Bland, to kill him. Howard defeated his would-be assassins with the help of theDefendersand they were sent to prison.[36]As it turned out, the assassination was unnecessary as the general populace refused to believe that Howard was a real talking duck, thinking of him instead as a dwarf in a duck suit. As a result, the public dismissed his candidacy as a joke.[37]\nHe continued to battle villains such as theBellhop,[38]Le Beaver,[39]Kong Lomerate,[40]theKidney Lady,[41]theRev. Joon Moon Yucand the Yuccies,[42]andRoxxon.[43]\nHis most notable arch-nemesis wasDoctor Bong. Through cleverness, persistence, and just plain good (if not dumb) luck, Howard always managed to either defeat or escape from his adversaries.[44]\nHoward went up against a hate group calledS.O.O.F.I.(SaveOurOffspringFromIndecency) who were \"trying to restore order to the world\".[45]\nWhile relaxing in his apartment Howard was attacked by a salt shaker with arms and legs on a giant housefly, but they were unable to defeat him. Dakimh and the Man-Thing arrived to ask Howard for his help and he was reluctantly transported to the Castle in the Sky over the Land Between Night and Day, where they were reunited with Korrek and Jennifer Kale. Dakimh brought them there to battle the demonBzzk'joh.[46]Bzzk'jho attacked them and Jennifer was forced to use her power to bring NAAC-P30 and 2-2 2-2, two Druid Droids that helped Howard, Korrek, and the Man-Thing stop jho. When Howard still refused to help, Korrek threatened Howard. Howard conceded when he tried to use the gun that was given to him by Dakimh and it turned out only to shoot a comedic flag. Riding Dakimh's spaceship, theEpoch Weasel, into the universe to get to jho's kingdom, the Imperium Emporium, the group escaped one of their delivery truck weapons. However, their ship was damaged, forcing them to land at the Hollywok Cantina. There they tried to find transport, dealing with real Californians and being told to speak to Big Mac about getting transport. Korrek tried to do so politely; however, he violently attacked Mac when he refused them transport, causing the real Californians to attack them. Howard managed to dispel them using the Farce through his gun, incapacitating them all. Securing a new ship, the group managed to burst into Bzzk'joh's base, the Death Store, a giant spaceship themed after a box store. There they fought through jho's armies and freed Jennifer, escaping just as the Death Store was set to explode, destroying jho and all of his followers.[47]They returned Howard toEarth-616New York, but he experienced nothing but trouble when he tried to help out a few New Yorkers[48]\nAfter finally meeting up with the cruise ship that rescued Paul and Winda, now befriended by socialite Iris Raritan, he attended her party onLong Island, where he was abducted by theRingmasterand hisCircus of Crime. Paul was shot and left in a coma, and Winda, abandoned by Paul and Iris, was apparently assaulted by a hobo.[49]After defeating the Circus of Crime Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, went his own way, as he had at the beginning of the series.[50][51]Howard then returned to Cleveland.[52]\nIron Duck\nHe battled Doctor Bong and teamed up withClaude Starkowitz, a former Vietnam vet who believed that he was related toTony Stark, the personal armorer toIron Man, and the genius behind the creation ofIron Man's Armor. Claude created for Howard a suit of Iron Man-inspired armor with springs and a built-in flamethrower, plus a device which would, hopefully, neutralize Bong's powers. Lee and Howard returned to the hospital, where Bong appeared to challenge Howard just as they finished setting up.[4]He used his bell to freeze everyone; however, it did not effect Howard who was protected not only by his armor but by cotton balls stuffed in his ears. The two engaged in a battle across the hospital, where Howard, in spite of being greatly outmatched, was able to lure Dr. Bong to the device which negated his powers. However, the device malfunctioned and Bong managed to grab Howard. With only one compartment untried, Howard opened up the armor's hip unit to find a small hammer. Remembering what happened to Bong the last time that he hit the bell on his head, Howard took the hammer and hit Bong on the head with it. The resulting peel from the bell transported both Bong and Howard away and freed everyone from Bong's paralysis. Howard and Bong rematerialized in Bong's castle, where Bong used his bell to strip Howard of his armor and removed his cotton balls. However, before Bong could finish Howard off, Beverly stopped him, showing him cloned babies that she she made and threatened to send a letter to the media, outing him as a negligent parent. Conceding and taking the cloned children, Dr. Bong angrily teleported Howard and Beverly back to the hospital. There they were reunited with Lee and Winda, who had come out of her coma.[53]\nNow living in Cleveland again, Howard battled new weird adversaries.[54]\nWhen Howard was on his way home from the laundromat, he was attacked out of the blue byDracula. Realizing Howard was not human he fled. Howard now started to displayvampire-like tendencies. He changed into traditional vampire garb and tried to attack Winda. Mistaking his bloodthirst for lust, Bev kicked Howard out of the house. The sometime-vampire hunterHarold H. Haroldcame looking for Howard and explained that his affliction was purely a disillusion. After a few failed attacks due to not having any teeth, they found him and tried to snap him out of the disillusion. Dracula arrived and tried to turn Bev into a vampire, but Howard staked him with a piece of a picket fence. Seeking immortality and listening to the dying Dracula claiming that he could give it to him, Harold foolishly removed the stake, and Dracula turned him into a vampire. Three days later, Howard read of reports of Harold clawing his way out of his grave.[55]\nHoward and Beverly on Duckworld\nHoward and Beverly arrived onDuckworldonEarth-791021. On this world, Beverly was considered the freak of the pair. Howard was eventually realized to have been the \"Drake\" who had vanished a few years back. Initially fleeing from overzealous worshipers, Howard led Beverly back to his former home, the base of the WACkies (Witness to theAscensionCult), and they learned what theRev. Godfrey Ganderhad done. Howard spoke up to the crowd, denouncing Rev. Godfrey and revealing the message that he had intended for them. Though initially reluctant, theDuckworldiansagreed to start thinking for themselves, while Gander vowed vengeance for losing his franchise. Howard worked to win his people over to Beverly, appearing with her onThe Tonight Showwith Johnny Quackson. In a \"This is Your Life\" pastiche, Howard was reunited with his parents and his sister Theresa, now a nun, and his brother Orville, now a mortician. However, the next guest,Dr. Ludwig von Cluck, actually a paid agent of Gander, attempted to use his Surrogate Sniffer super-vacuum machine to expose Beverly as a robot. It instead exposed her by tearing off all of her clothes. The appearance of a naked human appalled the Duckworldians. Howard and Beverly fled alongside fellow guest Truman Capoultry. A former ally of Gander, Capoultry wished to follow Howard's word and helped them escape. To help them return to Earth, Capoultry brought them toDucktor Strange, Mallard of the Mystic Arts, who was a drunk and living in an alley. Before Strange could do anything, the Rev. Gander,Scrounge McDrake, and their allies showed up and attempted to gun down Howard, Bev, Capoultry, and Strange. Bev kicked a trash can into their attackers, after which they overpowered them one-by-one. Strange cast a spell sending them back toEarth-616, and while Gander saw this as a chance to revive the WACkies, Capoultry vowed to write a new book telling the true story of Howard, which would foil Gander's plans.[21]\nArriving back in Earth-616, at the Nexus of All Realities in Florida, they teamed up with the Man-Thing again to battleKong Lomerate.[56]Howard and Bev got jobs at a retirement home inMiamiwhere they ran afoul of the grand designs of the Grey Panther.[6]The pair wound up inNew Orleanswhere Bev was kidnapped by theBlack Talonas an intended sacrifice of a voodoo cult.[57][58]\nHoward, working as a taxicab driver, had driven a customer to New York all the way from Cleveland. This man, calling himselfStatus Quo, was a mild-mannered librarian when the constant advent of new fads drove him to madness. Wanting to destroy all fads, Status Quo began studying how the media and advertisers help encourage fads, and came to New York in order to speak to people and convert them to his anti-fad group. This eventually led to a giant demonstration in Central Park where surprisingly, Status Quo managed to gather a large crowd and earn himself a legion of followers. These followers were armed with gimmicked fads (rocket-powered skateboards, exploding Frisbees, etc.) and sent out to attack anyone who supported any kind of fad. The chaos brought the attention ofSpider-Manwho tried to quell the mob, and prevent them from spreading beyond Central Park, while Howard was chased after by some anti-fad goons who thought he was trying to perpetuate a fad himself. Spider-Man eventually teamed up with Howard and the two managed to expose Status Quo as a hypocritical terrorist in front of live news cameras, discrediting him and causing his followers to break up. Afterwards, Howard and Spidey split up, and Howard returned to his cab where he found a police officer waiting for him to write him up on a number of traffic violations.[59]\nHoward was inSan Franciscoon Christmas Eve where he was on theGolden Gate Bridge, depressed and contemplating suicide. He was stopped by anAngelcalledAndy. Andy decided to try and boost Howard's confidence and morale; he showed Howard how the lives of its friends would have unfolded if Howard had never come toEarth-616. He showed HowardEarth-83234. They visited his friendsPaul Same,Arthur Winslow, andBeverly Switzler. To Howard and Andy's horror, all of his friends’ lives would have been better off without him. Believing that he had failed and that his life was worse than Howard's because he believed that would never get his wings, Andy considered suicide himself, but Howard succeeded in stopping him from doing so. Howard offered to buy Andy a drink rather than having either of them kill themselves. This act ironically won Andy his wings because, after all, itwasa successful mission.[60]\nHoward broke up with Beverly at her request. After that, he was mistaken for \"Duck Drake, Private Eye\".[57]He then metCeci Ryderwhen hitchhiking and battled theGopher, afterwards ending up back in Cleveland.[61]\nHoward later won 10 million dollars from the American Garden and Family grand prize contest. However, the fun and the fame changed him, causing him to lose contact with Bev. Dr. Dwight Clive convinced him to use the rest of his money to create a mate for himself. Using cell samples, he createdAlexis the Duck, but unwittingly used a brain taken from the body of the spoiled wife of a personal injury attorney. Alexis turned out to be a bitter gold digger who left Howard. Broke, he returned home to Cleveland.[16]\nThe Whoatcher had heartburn and created a cosmic burp that accidentally zappedSpider-HamofEarth-8311and Howard into an alternate dimension. They emerged onEarth-905237in the castle ofDucktor Doom. Working together they battled Doom, but the Whoatcher took some antacids, neutralizing the effects of the cosmic burp. Howard and Spider-Ham were sent home before the burp happened and disrupted Doom's weapon, which was the perfect synthesis between science and magic and with which he had intended to conquer the world. Howard felt that he got off easy, but then Ducktor Doom materialized in the alley behind him.[62]\nMeeting the She-Hulk\nTheShe-Hulkaccidentally pulled Howard through a cosmic wormhole, along with physicistBrent Wilcox, and prevented other universes from crowding outEarth-616.[63]Howard met the Critic, traveled to the Baloneyverse, and battled Dr. Angst and the Band of the Bland again.[64]\nIn California,ChamberandSkinofGeneration Xhitchhiked down a highway. After several cars flew past them, one of the vehicles stopped to offer the two mutants a ride. The driver of the vehicle was none other than Howard the Duck.[65]Howard and the mutants stopped at a bar to get some drinks, and the bartender informed them that their establishment did not serve ducks. Violence ensued and Howard was forced to rely upon his martial arts training inQuak Futo avoid injury. Chamber unleashed his mutant powers and began questioning the bar patrons about someone named Tores. To everyone's surprise,Miguela Toreswas actually a sultry young woman with a green stripe tattooed across her right eye. She entered the bar and began asking questions. While Chamber and Howard dealt with Tores, Skin sneaked away from the bar. He disguised himself as an old man and went to the cemetery to visit his own grave. There, he met his mother and managed to console her without letting on that he was, in fact, her son.[66]Outside in the Bio-Sphere, Howard and his girlfriend Bev arrived.Franklin,Artie, andLeechwere thrilled at the notion of having a talking duck to pal around with. Howard had no real interest in hanging out with children, but the kids dragged him to their treehouse. Inside they foundTana Nile. Tana was a Rigellian who crash-landed on Earth a short while ago. Leech had been sneaking her food from the school, and no one but the children were even aware of her presence.[67]Howard tried to find a way to get the children to safety.Black Tom Cassidyraided the tree house and prepared to kill them. Howard drove Black Tom back by setting him on fire with the lit end of his cigar. As the treehouse erupted into flames, Howard, Artie, Franklin, Leech, and Tana Nile discovered the Man-Thing present on the estate. Recognizing that the Man-Thing is the gateway into the dimensional rift known as the Nexus of All Realities, Howard convinced the others to dive into the creature's slimy body in the hopes of escaping. Their plan appeared to work and they disappeared inside the Man-Thing’s body.[68]\nHoward and the Daydreamers\nHoward and theDaydreamerswent sailing through the inter-dimensional byways of the Nexus, floating on a broken chunk of Earth. No one could really understand what was happening to them and Howard began to have a panic attack. Tana kept his attitude in check and reminds him that their first responsibility was to look after the children. Artie fell asleep and projected a vision of his nightmare: a dark, menacing shadowy figure. Before long, the Daydreamers arrived in a surreal fantasy world known as Nevernever-Narnozbia. Their earthen sled landed atop a woman (who looked suspiciously a lot like theScarlet Witch) known as the Red Witch of the Southeast, squashing her flat. A bunch of rocky little stone Things ran out to greet the visitors, expressing their happiness that the witch was finally dead. Suddenly, a man in drag named Strange arrived and thanked them for saving Nevernever-Narnozbia from the threat of the witch. Franklin expressed his desire to return home and Strange used the Eyeliner of Agamotto to direct them towards the King of the realm. Meanwhile, Howard the Duck was separated from the group and came upon a magic lamp. Rubbing the lamp, he summoned agreen goblin-likegenie who granted him three wishes. Howard wished for a way out of this mess, and the genie provides him with a DeSoto. Driving along in the antique car, he eventually met back up with his friends only for them to become prisoners of the King. The King bore a strong resemblance toDoctor Doom– an old foe of theFantastic Four. The Daydreamers tried to escape, and a fight broke out in the King's throne room. The dark spectral figure from Artie's vision arrived and declared that he had come for Franklin Richards.[69]\nThe Dark Hunter attacked theDaydreamersproclaiming that he had come for Franklin Richards. The Daydreamers could not decide which was stranger: the evil villain standing before them,Doctor Strangein drag, or the fact that the Man-Thing could suddenly carry on a conversation.Leechtried to siphon away the Dark Hunter's powers, but to no avail.Franklinasked Strange if he could send them home. Strange could not send them back to Earth, but instead used his magic wand to send them to another realm altogether. The group arrived in a bizarre cartoon-liked reality, which appeared as if it were crafted from the mind of Dr. Seuss. Weird creatures were seen walking down the streets with distended lips and large tufts of hair on their heads. Like the characters from Dr. Seuss, everyone had a penchant for speaking in rhyme. The Daydreamers stopped at a local diner to collect their thoughts. The staff at the diner became irate with Howard, who absolutely refused to speak in rhyme. Franklin placated the offended food servers by ordering their meals in rhyme for them. It did little good, however, as the Cadence Police arrived to arrest the Daydreamers. Howard wanted to start a fight with them, butTanaconvinced him that allowing them to be taken to jail might actually serve their better interests. Suddenly,Artiebegan to distrust Franklin. He continued to have visions of the Dark Hunter and felt that Franklin was connected to the Hunter in an unhealthy fashion. Franklin lashed out at him, declaring that he should mind his own business. Later that night, the Dark Hunter came for them. Tana Nile ripped the bars off of their prison cell and they broke free. She tried to keep the Dark Hunter at bay, but was unable to penetrate his shadowy form. Howard tried to get the Man-Thing to transport them back home, but the Man-Thing explained to him that he cannot control the power of the Nexus. Regardless, the Daydreamers dove into his slimy body and accessed theNexus of All Realities. When they exited, they found themselves onDuckworld– the planet of Howard's birth. They looked around in shock and awe as they saw a large bronze statue of Howard the Duck in the town square. To all accounts, Howard appeared to be a hero of the people.[70]\nCrowds of people began swelling around the new arrivals, eager to welcome their hero home. In an effort to keep the excited mob at bay, Tana Nile picked up the Man-Thing and began swinging him about like a baseball bat. The Daydreamers ducked down an alleyway and stealthily made their way towards Howard's home. Howard did not know why he was being hailed as a great hero and frankly, he did not care. The Man-Thing began to lose his cohesion, and Tana had to help him along. They arrived at the house of Howard's parents, June and Ward. It was an idyllic two-story home with a perfectly manicured lawn and a white picket fence. June and Ward came out to greet the newcomers and they welcomed Howard with open arms. Following a quick repast, Howard decided that he had had enough of this. He knew that this was not his true family and that his home life was never this perfect. As he shook his head in denial, the imagery washed away and all of it was revealed to be an illusion. Meanwhile, the Man-Thing continued to fall apart. Tapping into the cosmic energies of theNexus of All Realitieshad proven too taxing for his physical form and he could no longer maintain his cohesion. Before long, the Dark Hunter arrived on Duckworld and continued his pursuit ofFranklin Richards. The Daydreamers left Howard's phony household and proceeded to a place known as the Richards Institute. Inside were two-dimensional cartoon versions of Franklin's parents,ReedandSusan Richards. The Dark Hunter tracked them down and they soon realized what the Hunter actually was – he was the living embodiment of Franklin Richard's repressed emotions. When the Daydreamers first interacted with the Nexus of All Realities, it reacted with Franklin's dormantmutantpowers, creating a conduit into a pocket dimension inside Franklin's subconscious mind. Franklin never came to terms with the fact that his parents were gone – victims of the villain known asOnslaught. In his grief, he fabricated an imaginary, illusory world where he could effectively hide from his pain. Now having confronted his own fears in the form of the Dark Hunter, Franklin was finally ready to let go of his parents. As Franklin's pocket reality ceased to exist, the Daydreamers exited the Nexus of All Realities. They were back onEarth-616in the FloridaEverglades, and the Man-Thing was back to his normal, inarticulate self.[71]\nWhile the Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian of Franklin, Howard went off on his own and was captured by theCult of Entropy.[72]Although he was last seen him in the swamp, he stated that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wanted him because he had part of the Nexus of All Realities, which had shattered duringHeroes Reborn, inside him, which he knew because it was making him nauseous. The Man-Thing entered his gullet, and Howard vomited him back out with the fragment, but the former was left desiccated and practically dead.[73]\nHe then encounteredNamor the Sub-Mariner, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explained that he would not be lugging his friend's body if that were the case. Howard set the Man-Thing down in the water, and he revived during the conversation with Namor. Once he saw that the Man-Thing was alive and well, he bid Namor farewell and told him that he was returning to Cleveland.[74]\nHe worked withSpider-Man (Ben Reilly)in a fight against the Circus of Crime, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting theSavage DragonandDestroyer Duck. The group left in the belief that they had brought the correct Howard with them.[75]\nJennifer Kale attempted to return Howard home many times, but he accused her and Doctor Strange of being responsible for bringing him toEarth-616. She accidentally teleportedDevil DinosaurandMoon Boyinto her New York apartment.[76]The disoriented dinosaur attempted to eat Howard, but spat him out when he was shot with theGhost Rider'sHellfire Shotgun. They then went on a rampage through the city before being subdued by theGhost Rider. Howard related to the pair, being trapped in a world he was never meant to be in, and wandered off.[77]\nHoward got a job as a department storeSanta Claus, which got him dragged to theNorth Pole, where the realSanta Claushad sold out toHydra.[78]\nHoward the Duck in mouse form\nBeverly obtained a job at a company that was owned by Doctor Bong who turned Howard into a mouse, but the process was unstable and he cycled through different forms before settling on the mouse form again.[79]Bong joined withKenneth Floggto gain theAmulet of Pazuzu, but Howard obtained it first, gained its power, and used it to slay Flogg's assistant,Ian Whippingham.[80]They next stayed at theBoarding House of Mystery, joining their fellow tenant,Splatter Gomorrah, in exposing talk show hostIprahas a marketing franchise.[81]However, she was possessed by the angel-demon hybridDeuteronomy. Howard used the cigar of the Saint of Therapists,Sigmund Freud, to banish Deuteronomy; however, he decided to take a puff of the cigar which disintegrated him and sent him toHell.[82]He was saved byGodHimself who, grateful for him dealing with Deuteronomy, shared with Howard the meaning of life before returning him to Earth back in his duck form.[83][84]\nHoward the Duck tried to sue the directorGeorge Lucasover a film, and was represented byGoodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway.[85][86]\nAs an interdimensional non-human being, Howard was compelled to register under theSuperhuman Registration Actalong with Beverly.[7]He attempted to do so during theCivil War[87]but learned that his socially disruptive life had created so many bureaucratic headaches that the U.S. government's policy was that Howard, the so-called infamous \"Duck Man of Cleveland\", did not exist. This lack of government oversight delighted Howard: \"For the rest of my life... no more parking tickets - or taxes - or jury duty. Heck, I couldn't even vote if I wanted to! This is even better than Christmas in Vegas! I no longer officially exist!\"[7][88]\nAfter he defeatedM.O.D.O.T.'s scheme to control the public through the mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, had him registered with the government. including all relevant responsibilities and the President made him a citizen with a full presidential pardon.[89]\nAt some point, Howard was made part of theOhio Initiative, but the team was eventually shut down by the Feds for unrevealed reasons.[10]He was subsequently made an agent ofA.R.M.O.R., and was hired byMorbius the Living Vampireon a private mission to travel through the multiverses of different types of zombies and collect a sample of each one of them. Before he could go, he was to search forMachine Manand recruit him. One week after being enrolled, Howard found Machine Man drunk and depressed, for his girlfriendJocastawent back to her former husbandUltron. Howard was able to convince Machine Man to join him on their mission.[90]\nThe Fearsome Four\nDuring theFear Itselfevent, Howard formed a team called theFearsome Fourwith theShe-Hulk,Frankenstein's Monster, andNighthawkto stop theMan-Thing, who found himself driven to an uncontrollable rage caused by the immense levels of fear generated by theSerpent'shammer-wieldersacross the world.[91]Facing various alternate universe heroes and thePsycho-Man, brought to Earth by the Man-Thing's connection to theNexus of All Realities,[92]the Four were eventually able to confront their own fears and calm the Man-Thing, bringing an end to his rampage and saving the world, before going their separate ways.[93]\nCynical Duck and Swizzle\nHoward and Bev were both brainwashed and forced to work forS.O.O.F.I.as Cynical Duck and Swizzle. They promoted S.O.O.F.I. at a public speech held for them byJ. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man interrupted a S.O.O.F.I. indoctrination at theNew York Public Library, and Bev and the other S.O.O.F.I.s saw Spidey as a semi-demonic figure and attacked him. Spidey escaped with Howard and broke his brainwashing because Bev was being threatened. Howard quickly explained S.O.O.F.I.'s goals to Spider-Man. As Spider-Man publicly announced his long-standing support for S.O.O.F.I., Howard confronted Bev as she stood by theSupreme S.O.O.F.I.. Howard broke through to Bev, reminding her of their past. The leader ordered the S.O.O.F.I.s to throw the pair into the special Blanditron atGuantanamo Bay, and Bev kept them at bay with her whip. Spidey attacked them and unmasked the Supreme S.O.O.F.I., while the others escaped though their teleporter. Howard believed S.O.O.F.I. would lay low for a while after such a defeat, and also hoped their Florida Everglades base might lead them to meet up with the Man-Thing.[12]\nThe Ducky Dozen\nBecause of his experience with zombie-infested worlds and his leadership of Machine Man, Howard was chosen as the leader of, as he dubbed them, theDucky Dozen.[94]The team was comprised of himself, several Golden Age heroes,Dum Dum Dugan, andBattlestar, who was also a veteran of a zombie incident. Upon enteringEarth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fought hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffered grave losses as most of the members were either killed or zombified in battle.[95]After successfully accomplishing their mission Howard, Dugan, Taxi Taylor, and Battlestar were the only members left that had survived and returned toEarth-616along with theRiveter, the only survivor of Earth-12591's resistance team theSuffragists.[96][97]\nHoward teamed up with his friendDoopto battle Robo-Barbarians in Dimension ZZZ. They beat the horde back with nothing but a broken sword, a rubber chicken with nails in it, and a gun that shot bees.[98]\nAfter the death ofUatu the Watcherand the activation of the secrets buried in his eye, Howard discovered that he had the potential to be the most intelligent being in Duckworld. After evading a squirrel while driving, he was thrown flying and used his intellect to calculate his way to land safely in a dumpster.[22]\nHoward returned to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as theShe-Hulkin Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by theBlack Cat. With the help ofTara Tam, a new ally, Howard managed to recover the necklace, but on his way to give it back to Richards he found himself kidnapped by theCollector,[99]allied with theGuardians of the Galaxyto escape the villain's collection,[100]and confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him.\nDuring his third attempt at recovering the necklace, from the Ringmaster this time, Howard was approached by Richards, who revealed himself to be theSkrullTalos the Untamed, and explained the true nature of the stone in the necklace: it was one of the several Abundant Gems.[101]Once Talos fled the scene, Howard and Tara sought the help ofDoctor Strangeto learn more about these Abundant Gems. Joined by theHuman Torch, the heroes failed to beat Talos in the race for the final gem, and the villain made himself more powerful with theAbundant Glove.[102]In the middle of the battle, during which Tara publicly revealed his shapeshifting abilities to help fight the energy constructs that were created by Talos, Howard managed to snatch the Abundant Glove from the alien villain and defeat him.[103]\nHoward eventually set out to return to his home dimension, and traveled toFloridato find theNexus of All Realitiesin order to reach this goal. However, his attempt to use theCompassion Gemof theAbundant Gloveto help him find his way home merged him with the Nexus.[104]The fusion turned Howard into a Living Nexus which could also be used to teleport to different destinations willingly instead of randomly, as the Nexus normally acted. Howard's new-found powers caught the attention of numerous people who desired to use Howard for their own ends, including gender-bent clones of Howard andRocket RaccoonnamedLindaandShocket Raccoon, who wanted to rescue everyone trapped inCollectonand escape to another universe.\nHoward agreed to help Linda and Shocket, and on their way to Collecton, they were pursued by bothSkrullsand theStranger.[105]Howard was seemingly rescued from the Stranger's clutches byScout, a cosmic-powered girl who wanted to give Howard as a gift toGalactusand prove herself worthy of being his new Herald. With the help of theSilver Surferand theGuardians of the Galaxy, Howard's allies rescued him.[106]Using a portion of thePower Cosmicgranted to him by the Silver Surfer, Howard brought his allies to Collecton and helped both defeat the Collector and free its prisoners, who used Howard's powers as the Living Nexus to return to their homes. When Howard was separated from the Nexus and used it to return home, he was accidentally sent to the doorstep of Bev's new house.[8]Following a bittersweet and brief reunion, Howard returned to New York.[107]\nWhile investigating a case for actressLea Thompson, Howard discovered that the nefariousMojoof theMojoversehad turned him into the unwitting protagonist of his own reality show. However, in order to ensure Howard's life remained interesting for the ratings, he had hired the services ofChippandJho, two members of the race ofreality warpersknown as theSparkitects, who had subtly influenced Howard's life and been responsible for most of his recent misadventures.[108]\nThe two Sparkitects became directly involved with Howard's confrontation against Mojo after realizing that the villain could find out that Howard discovering the reality show was an attempt by them to shut down Mojo's program and cut off all ties with him. When Howard confronted Chipp, the Sparkitect stabbed and killed him.[19]However, Jho's attempt to redeem his wrongs brought Howard back to life, after manipulatingDoctor Strangeinto returning his soul to his body.\nDuckworldian Physiology:Howard's body, like those of his entire race, has similar characteristics to those of both common Earth ducks and common Earth human beings. He has hands and arms instead of wings, is covered with feathers and is unable to fly. Howard is similar to a human athlete who has trained his body to the fullest. Howard can stay alive in the space vacuum without suffering any harmful effects, even without using any type of suit that protects him from the environment or provides him with oxygen.[109][106]\nEnhanced Duckworldian Speed:After his training Howard has improved his speed, moving faster than the human eye can see.[5]\nSuper Reflexes and Precision:Howard's reflexes have been honed to the point of utmost precision, allowing him to allegedly move faster than the eye can see. He is also capable of catching a knife being thrown at him.[5]\nMystical Training:TheSorcerer SupremeDoctor Strangehas also briefly tutored Howard in the mystic ways, indicating even those of Duckworld possess magical potential.[109][110][111][112][113]Under his mental guidance, Howard was capable of conjuring theVapors of Valtorr, theShield of the Seraphim, use transformation enchantments and even utilize anotherEye of AgamottoandCloak of Levitationalong with his own garb forHoward the Duck, which the duck was able to command, despite his lack ofSorcerer Supremetitle, though ultimately declining to study as Strange's apprentice. Dr. Strange has claimed that Howard has incredible potential, making him one of the most powerful sorcerers.[36]\nLiving Nexus:Howard was temporarily merged with theNexus of All Realities, allowing him to act as a gateway to the Multiverse. When somebody touches him, he can choose where they will travel or they can make their own choice. He can also create an entirely new universe with his own specifications and can be tracked by cosmic beings and ships acting like an \"cosmic ark.\"[105]\nMartial Arts:Howard is a master in the little-known martial art calledQuak Fu, which he learned at the hands ofMaster C'haaj,[5]and hence is a surprisingly formidable opponent in hand-to-hand combat, which allows him to defeat opponents that are more powerful than himself.[109]\nWillpower:As part of his Quak Fu training, Howard reached a new state of consciousness and developed an immense willpower. Howard can use his will to break down material barriers with easy sum, apparently increasing his strength.[5]\nSuper-Fast Learning:During his martial arts training, Howard dominated the irrelevance of chronological time, giving him the ability to master a life of studies and training in just three hours and seventeen minutes.[5]"

Duckworld resembles mankind's Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. He was the son of aRonaldandHenrietta, a working class Roman Catholic couple living in New Stork. He had two siblings,TheresaandOrville.[21]As a child, he discovered an amazing potential intellect; however, he was continuously bullied by other children as a result. He eventually decided to give up on his studies, wasting his potential.[22]Further details about Howard's past on Duckworld are still unknown. Indeed, there are conflicting accounts as to the circumstances surrounding his disappearance.\nHoward vanished from his home world when the power-hungry demon-lordThog the Nether-Spawnused his demonic powers to cause the interdimensional cosmic axis to shift. Howard was dislodged from his home dimension and dropped into the middle of theFloridaEverglades onEarth-616at the site of this world'sNexus of All Realities, a place from which travel to all other dimensions is said to be possible. In an effort to set the Cosmic Axis right and return home, the reluctant Howard joined withKorrek of Ktharta, who also came from another dimension, the young Earth-born sorceressJennifer Kale,Dakimh the Enchanter, and theMan-Thing, the guardian of the Nexus. The battle against Thog ended for Howard when he fell off the other-dimensional Stepping Stones of Oblivion.[23][24][25]\nHe landed back onEarth-616in the city ofCleveland,Ohio, where he first faced the menace ofGarko, the Man-Frog.[26][27]\nHoward the Duck wanted to establish a reputation in Cleveland. As such, he sought to earn a position on the Cleveland police force by catching this mysterious farm stalker. During the investigation, he foundBessie the Hellcow, who attacked him, but Howard kept her at bay with a cross. During the fight, he used a mallet and wooden stake to seemingly end the blood-sucking bovine's hellish existence once and for all. Despite his heroism, however, Howard was still denied a position on the Cleveland police force, much to his dismay.[28][29]\nIn Cleveland, Howard first met the young life modelBeverly Switzlerwho was a captive of the costumed criminal accountantPro-Rata. Howard and Beverly escaped and began living together.[30]\nAlthough Howard attempted to live as normal a life as possible, considering that he was a talking duck on a world of human beings, he continually ran afoul of various unusual menaces including theTurnip Man,[31]Count Macho,[5]theWinky-Man,[32]Emile \"The Goat\" Klout[33]and theGingerbread Man.[34]\nHoward came to public notoriety when he became a candidate for the United States Presidency on a very minor party ticket.[35]He was even the target of an assassination plot as someone hiredDoctor Angstand his group, theBand of the Bland, to kill him. Howard defeated his would-be assassins with the help of theDefendersand they were sent to prison.[36]As it turned out, the assassination was unnecessary as the general populace refused to believe that Howard was a real talking duck, thinking of him instead as a dwarf in a duck suit. As a result, the public dismissed his candidacy as a joke.[37]\nHe continued to battle villains such as theBellhop,[38]Le Beaver,[39]Kong Lomerate,[40]theKidney Lady,[41]theRev. Joon Moon Yucand the Yuccies,[42]andRoxxon.[43]\nHis most notable arch-nemesis wasDoctor Bong. Through cleverness, persistence, and just plain good (if not dumb) luck, Howard always managed to either defeat or escape from his adversaries.[44]\nHoward went up against a hate group calledS.O.O.F.I.(SaveOurOffspringFromIndecency) who were \"trying to restore order to the world\".[45]\nWhile relaxing in his apartment Howard was attacked by a salt shaker with arms and legs on a giant housefly, but they were unable to defeat him. Dakimh and the Man-Thing arrived to ask Howard for his help and he was reluctantly transported to the Castle in the Sky over the Land Between Night and Day, where they were reunited with Korrek and Jennifer Kale. Dakimh brought them there to battle the demonBzzk'joh.[46]Bzzk'jho attacked them and Jennifer was forced to use her power to bring NAAC-P30 and 2-2 2-2, two Druid Droids that helped Howard, Korrek, and the Man-Thing stop jho. When Howard still refused to help, Korrek threatened Howard. Howard conceded when he tried to use the gun that was given to him by Dakimh and it turned out only to shoot a comedic flag. Riding Dakimh's spaceship, theEpoch Weasel, into the universe to get to jho's kingdom, the Imperium Emporium, the group escaped one of their delivery truck weapons. However, their ship was damaged, forcing them to land at the Hollywok Cantina. There they tried to find transport, dealing with real Californians and being told to speak to Big Mac about getting transport. Korrek tried to do so politely; however, he violently attacked Mac when he refused them transport, causing the real Californians to attack them. Howard managed to dispel them using the Farce through his gun, incapacitating them all. Securing a new ship, the group managed to burst into Bzzk'joh's base, the Death Store, a giant spaceship themed after a box store. There they fought through jho's armies and freed Jennifer, escaping just as the Death Store was set to explode, destroying jho and all of his followers.[47]They returned Howard toEarth-616New York, but he experienced nothing but trouble when he tried to help out a few New Yorkers[48]\nAfter finally meeting up with the cruise ship that rescued Paul and Winda, now befriended by socialite Iris Raritan, he attended her party onLong Island, where he was abducted by theRingmasterand hisCircus of Crime. Paul was shot and left in a coma, and Winda, abandoned by Paul and Iris, was apparently assaulted by a hobo.[49]After defeating the Circus of Crime Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, went his own way, as he had at the beginning of the series.[50][51]Howard then returned to Cleveland.[52]\nIron Duck\nHe battled Doctor Bong and teamed up withClaude Starkowitz, a former Vietnam vet who believed that he was related toTony Stark, the personal armorer toIron Man, and the genius behind the creation ofIron Man's Armor. Claude created for Howard a suit of Iron Man-inspired armor with springs and a built-in flamethrower, plus a device which would, hopefully, neutralize Bong's powers. Lee and Howard returned to the hospital, where Bong appeared to challenge Howard just as they finished setting up.[4]He used his bell to freeze everyone; however, it did not effect Howard who was protected not only by his armor but by cotton balls stuffed in his ears. The two engaged in a battle across the hospital, where Howard, in spite of being greatly outmatched, was able to lure Dr. Bong to the device which negated his powers. However, the device malfunctioned and Bong managed to grab Howard. With only one compartment untried, Howard opened up the armor's hip unit to find a small hammer. Remembering what happened to Bong the last time that he hit the bell on his head, Howard took the hammer and hit Bong on the head with it. The resulting peel from the bell transported both Bong and Howard away and freed everyone from Bong's paralysis. Howard and Bong rematerialized in Bong's castle, where Bong used his bell to strip Howard of his armor and removed his cotton balls. However, before Bong could finish Howard off, Beverly stopped him, showing him cloned babies that she she made and threatened to send a letter to the media, outing him as a negligent parent. Conceding and taking the cloned children, Dr. Bong angrily teleported Howard and Beverly back to the hospital. There they were reunited with Lee and Winda, who had come out of her coma.[53]\nNow living in Cleveland again, Howard battled new weird adversaries.[54]\nWhen Howard was on his way home from the laundromat, he was attacked out of the blue byDracula. Realizing Howard was not human he fled. Howard now started to displayvampire-like tendencies. He changed into traditional vampire garb and tried to attack Winda. Mistaking his bloodthirst for lust, Bev kicked Howard out of the house. The sometime-vampire hunterHarold H. Haroldcame looking for Howard and explained that his affliction was purely a disillusion. After a few failed attacks due to not having any teeth, they found him and tried to snap him out of the disillusion. Dracula arrived and tried to turn Bev into a vampire, but Howard staked him with a piece of a picket fence. Seeking immortality and listening to the dying Dracula claiming that he could give it to him, Harold foolishly removed the stake, and Dracula turned him into a vampire. Three days later, Howard read of reports of Harold clawing his way out of his grave.[55]\nHoward and Beverly on Duckworld\nHoward and Beverly arrived onDuckworldonEarth-791021. On this world, Beverly was considered the freak of the pair. Howard was eventually realized to have been the \"Drake\" who had vanished a few years back. Initially fleeing from overzealous worshipers, Howard led Beverly back to his former home, the base of the WACkies (Witness to theAscensionCult), and they learned what theRev. Godfrey Ganderhad done. Howard spoke up to the crowd, denouncing Rev. Godfrey and revealing the message that he had intended for them. Though initially reluctant, theDuckworldiansagreed to start thinking for themselves, while Gander vowed vengeance for losing his franchise. Howard worked to win his people over to Beverly, appearing with her onThe Tonight Showwith Johnny Quackson. In a \"This is Your Life\" pastiche, Howard was reunited with his parents and his sister Theresa, now a nun, and his brother Orville, now a mortician. However, the next guest,Dr. Ludwig von Cluck, actually a paid agent of Gander, attempted to use his Surrogate Sniffer super-vacuum machine to expose Beverly as a robot. It instead exposed her by tearing off all of her clothes. The appearance of a naked human appalled the Duckworldians. Howard and Beverly fled alongside fellow guest Truman Capoultry. A former ally of Gander, Capoultry wished to follow Howard's word and helped them escape. To help them return to Earth, Capoultry brought them toDucktor Strange, Mallard of the Mystic Arts, who was a drunk and living in an alley. Before Strange could do anything, the Rev. Gander,Scrounge McDrake, and their allies showed up and attempted to gun down Howard, Bev, Capoultry, and Strange. Bev kicked a trash can into their attackers, after which they overpowered them one-by-one. Strange cast a spell sending them back toEarth-616, and while Gander saw this as a chance to revive the WACkies, Capoultry vowed to write a new book telling the true story of Howard, which would foil Gander's plans.[21]\nArriving back in Earth-616, at the Nexus of All Realities in Florida, they teamed up with the Man-Thing again to battleKong Lomerate.[56]Howard and Bev got jobs at a retirement home inMiamiwhere they ran afoul of the grand designs of the Grey Panther.[6]The pair wound up inNew Orleanswhere Bev was kidnapped by theBlack Talonas an intended sacrifice of a voodoo cult.[57][58]\nHoward, working as a taxicab driver, had driven a customer to New York all the way from Cleveland. This man, calling himselfStatus Quo, was a mild-mannered librarian when the constant advent of new fads drove him to madness. Wanting to destroy all fads, Status Quo began studying how the media and advertisers help encourage fads, and came to New York in order to speak to people and convert them to his anti-fad group. This eventually led to a giant demonstration in Central Park where surprisingly, Status Quo managed to gather a large crowd and earn himself a legion of followers. These followers were armed with gimmicked fads (rocket-powered skateboards, exploding Frisbees, etc.) and sent out to attack anyone who supported any kind of fad. The chaos brought the attention ofSpider-Manwho tried to quell the mob, and prevent them from spreading beyond Central Park, while Howard was chased after by some anti-fad goons who thought he was trying to perpetuate a fad himself. Spider-Man eventually teamed up with Howard and the two managed to expose Status Quo as a hypocritical terrorist in front of live news cameras, discrediting him and causing his followers to break up. Afterwards, Howard and Spidey split up, and Howard returned to his cab where he found a police officer waiting for him to write him up on a number of traffic violations.[59]\nHoward was inSan Franciscoon Christmas Eve where he was on theGolden Gate Bridge, depressed and contemplating suicide. He was stopped by anAngelcalledAndy. Andy decided to try and boost Howard's confidence and morale; he showed Howard how the lives of its friends would have unfolded if Howard had never come toEarth-616. He showed HowardEarth-83234. They visited his friendsPaul Same,Arthur Winslow, andBeverly Switzler. To Howard and Andy's horror, all of his friends’ lives would have been better off without him. Believing that he had failed and that his life was worse than Howard's because he believed that would never get his wings, Andy considered suicide himself, but Howard succeeded in stopping him from doing so. Howard offered to buy Andy a drink rather than having either of them kill themselves. This act ironically won Andy his wings because, after all, itwasa successful mission.[60]\nHoward broke up with Beverly at her request. After that, he was mistaken for \"Duck Drake, Private Eye\".[57]He then metCeci Ryderwhen hitchhiking and battled theGopher, afterwards ending up back in Cleveland.[61]\nHoward later won 10 million dollars from the American Garden and Family grand prize contest. However, the fun and the fame changed him, causing him to lose contact with Bev. Dr. Dwight Clive convinced him to use the rest of his money to create a mate for himself. Using cell samples, he createdAlexis the Duck, but unwittingly used a brain taken from the body of the spoiled wife of a personal injury attorney. Alexis turned out to be a bitter gold digger who left Howard. Broke, he returned home to Cleveland.[16]\nThe Whoatcher had heartburn and created a cosmic burp that accidentally zappedSpider-HamofEarth-8311and Howard into an alternate dimension. They emerged onEarth-905237in the castle ofDucktor Doom. Working together they battled Doom, but the Whoatcher took some antacids, neutralizing the effects of the cosmic burp. Howard and Spider-Ham were sent home before the burp happened and disrupted Doom's weapon, which was the perfect synthesis between science and magic and with which he had intended to conquer the world. Howard felt that he got off easy, but then Ducktor Doom materialized in the alley behind him.[62]\nMeeting the She-Hulk\nTheShe-Hulkaccidentally pulled Howard through a cosmic wormhole, along with physicistBrent Wilcox, and prevented other universes from crowding outEarth-616.[63]Howard met the Critic, traveled to the Baloneyverse, and battled Dr. Angst and the Band of the Bland again.[64]\nIn California,ChamberandSkinofGeneration Xhitchhiked down a highway. After several cars flew past them, one of the vehicles stopped to offer the two mutants a ride. The driver of the vehicle was none other than Howard the Duck.[65]Howard and the mutants stopped at a bar to get some drinks, and the bartender informed them that their establishment did not serve ducks. Violence ensued and Howard was forced to rely upon his martial arts training inQuak Futo avoid injury. Chamber unleashed his mutant powers and began questioning the bar patrons about someone named Tores. To everyone's surprise,Miguela Toreswas actually a sultry young woman with a green stripe tattooed across her right eye. She entered the bar and began asking questions. While Chamber and Howard dealt with Tores, Skin sneaked away from the bar. He disguised himself as an old man and went to the cemetery to visit his own grave. There, he met his mother and managed to console her without letting on that he was, in fact, her son.[66]Outside in the Bio-Sphere, Howard and his girlfriend Bev arrived.Franklin,Artie, andLeechwere thrilled at the notion of having a talking duck to pal around with. Howard had no real interest in hanging out with children, but the kids dragged him to their treehouse. Inside they foundTana Nile. Tana was a Rigellian who crash-landed on Earth a short while ago. Leech had been sneaking her food from the school, and no one but the children were even aware of her presence.[67]Howard tried to find a way to get the children to safety.Black Tom Cassidyraided the tree house and prepared to kill them. Howard drove Black Tom back by setting him on fire with the lit end of his cigar. As the treehouse erupted into flames, Howard, Artie, Franklin, Leech, and Tana Nile discovered the Man-Thing present on the estate. Recognizing that the Man-Thing is the gateway into the dimensional rift known as the Nexus of All Realities, Howard convinced the others to dive into the creature's slimy body in the hopes of escaping. Their plan appeared to work and they disappeared inside the Man-Thing’s body.[68]\nHoward and the Daydreamers\nHoward and theDaydreamerswent sailing through the inter-dimensional byways of the Nexus, floating on a broken chunk of Earth. No one could really understand what was happening to them and Howard began to have a panic attack. Tana kept his attitude in check and reminds him that their first responsibility was to look after the children. Artie fell asleep and projected a vision of his nightmare: a dark, menacing shadowy figure. Before long, the Daydreamers arrived in a surreal fantasy world known as Nevernever-Narnozbia. Their earthen sled landed atop a woman (who looked suspiciously a lot like theScarlet Witch) known as the Red Witch of the Southeast, squashing her flat. A bunch of rocky little stone Things ran out to greet the visitors, expressing their happiness that the witch was finally dead. Suddenly, a man in drag named Strange arrived and thanked them for saving Nevernever-Narnozbia from the threat of the witch. Franklin expressed his desire to return home and Strange used the Eyeliner of Agamotto to direct them towards the King of the realm. Meanwhile, Howard the Duck was separated from the group and came upon a magic lamp. Rubbing the lamp, he summoned agreen goblin-likegenie who granted him three wishes. Howard wished for a way out of this mess, and the genie provides him with a DeSoto. Driving along in the antique car, he eventually met back up with his friends only for them to become prisoners of the King. The King bore a strong resemblance toDoctor Doom– an old foe of theFantastic Four. The Daydreamers tried to escape, and a fight broke out in the King's throne room. The dark spectral figure from Artie's vision arrived and declared that he had come for Franklin Richards.[69]\nThe Dark Hunter attacked theDaydreamersproclaiming that he had come for Franklin Richards. The Daydreamers could not decide which was stranger: the evil villain standing before them,Doctor Strangein drag, or the fact that the Man-Thing could suddenly carry on a conversation.Leechtried to siphon away the Dark Hunter's powers, but to no avail.Franklinasked Strange if he could send them home. Strange could not send them back to Earth, but instead used his magic wand to send them to another realm altogether. The group arrived in a bizarre cartoon-liked reality, which appeared as if it were crafted from the mind of Dr. Seuss. Weird creatures were seen walking down the streets with distended lips and large tufts of hair on their heads. Like the characters from Dr. Seuss, everyone had a penchant for speaking in rhyme. The Daydreamers stopped at a local diner to collect their thoughts. The staff at the diner became irate with Howard, who absolutely refused to speak in rhyme. Franklin placated the offended food servers by ordering their meals in rhyme for them. It did little good, however, as the Cadence Police arrived to arrest the Daydreamers. Howard wanted to start a fight with them, butTanaconvinced him that allowing them to be taken to jail might actually serve their better interests. Suddenly,Artiebegan to distrust Franklin. He continued to have visions of the Dark Hunter and felt that Franklin was connected to the Hunter in an unhealthy fashion. Franklin lashed out at him, declaring that he should mind his own business. Later that night, the Dark Hunter came for them. Tana Nile ripped the bars off of their prison cell and they broke free. She tried to keep the Dark Hunter at bay, but was unable to penetrate his shadowy form. Howard tried to get the Man-Thing to transport them back home, but the Man-Thing explained to him that he cannot control the power of the Nexus. Regardless, the Daydreamers dove into his slimy body and accessed theNexus of All Realities. When they exited, they found themselves onDuckworld– the planet of Howard's birth. They looked around in shock and awe as they saw a large bronze statue of Howard the Duck in the town square. To all accounts, Howard appeared to be a hero of the people.[70]\nCrowds of people began swelling around the new arrivals, eager to welcome their hero home. In an effort to keep the excited mob at bay, Tana Nile picked up the Man-Thing and began swinging him about like a baseball bat. The Daydreamers ducked down an alleyway and stealthily made their way towards Howard's home. Howard did not know why he was being hailed as a great hero and frankly, he did not care. The Man-Thing began to lose his cohesion, and Tana had to help him along. They arrived at the house of Howard's parents, June and Ward. It was an idyllic two-story home with a perfectly manicured lawn and a white picket fence. June and Ward came out to greet the newcomers and they welcomed Howard with open arms. Following a quick repast, Howard decided that he had had enough of this. He knew that this was not his true family and that his home life was never this perfect. As he shook his head in denial, the imagery washed away and all of it was revealed to be an illusion. Meanwhile, the Man-Thing continued to fall apart. Tapping into the cosmic energies of theNexus of All Realitieshad proven too taxing for his physical form and he could no longer maintain his cohesion. Before long, the Dark Hunter arrived on Duckworld and continued his pursuit ofFranklin Richards. The Daydreamers left Howard's phony household and proceeded to a place known as the Richards Institute. Inside were two-dimensional cartoon versions of Franklin's parents,ReedandSusan Richards. The Dark Hunter tracked them down and they soon realized what the Hunter actually was – he was the living embodiment of Franklin Richard's repressed emotions. When the Daydreamers first interacted with the Nexus of All Realities, it reacted with Franklin's dormantmutantpowers, creating a conduit into a pocket dimension inside Franklin's subconscious mind. Franklin never came to terms with the fact that his parents were gone – victims of the villain known asOnslaught. In his grief, he fabricated an imaginary, illusory world where he could effectively hide from his pain. Now having confronted his own fears in the form of the Dark Hunter, Franklin was finally ready to let go of his parents. As Franklin's pocket reality ceased to exist, the Daydreamers exited the Nexus of All Realities. They were back onEarth-616in the FloridaEverglades, and the Man-Thing was back to his normal, inarticulate self.[71]\nWhile the Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian of Franklin, Howard went off on his own and was captured by theCult of Entropy.[72]Although he was last seen him in the swamp, he stated that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wanted him because he had part of the Nexus of All Realities, which had shattered duringHeroes Reborn, inside him, which he knew because it was making him nauseous. The Man-Thing entered his gullet, and Howard vomited him back out with the fragment, but the former was left desiccated and practically dead.[73]\nHe then encounteredNamor the Sub-Mariner, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explained that he would not be lugging his friend's body if that were the case. Howard set the Man-Thing down in the water, and he revived during the conversation with Namor. Once he saw that the Man-Thing was alive and well, he bid Namor farewell and told him that he was returning to Cleveland.[74]\nHe worked withSpider-Man (Ben Reilly)in a fight against the Circus of Crime, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting theSavage DragonandDestroyer Duck. The group left in the belief that they had brought the correct Howard with them.[75]\nJennifer Kale attempted to return Howard home many times, but he accused her and Doctor Strange of being responsible for bringing him toEarth-616. She accidentally teleportedDevil DinosaurandMoon Boyinto her New York apartment.[76]The disoriented dinosaur attempted to eat Howard, but spat him out when he was shot with theGhost Rider'sHellfire Shotgun. They then went on a rampage through the city before being subdued by theGhost Rider. Howard related to the pair, being trapped in a world he was never meant to be in, and wandered off.[77]\nHoward got a job as a department storeSanta Claus, which got him dragged to theNorth Pole, where the realSanta Claushad sold out toHydra.[78]\nHoward the Duck in mouse form\nBeverly obtained a job at a company that was owned by Doctor Bong who turned Howard into a mouse, but the process was unstable and he cycled through different forms before settling on the mouse form again.[79]Bong joined withKenneth Floggto gain theAmulet of Pazuzu, but Howard obtained it first, gained its power, and used it to slay Flogg's assistant,Ian Whippingham.[80]They next stayed at theBoarding House of Mystery, joining their fellow tenant,Splatter Gomorrah, in exposing talk show hostIprahas a marketing franchise.[81]However, she was possessed by the angel-demon hybridDeuteronomy. Howard used the cigar of the Saint of Therapists,Sigmund Freud, to banish Deuteronomy; however, he decided to take a puff of the cigar which disintegrated him and sent him toHell.[82]He was saved byGodHimself who, grateful for him dealing with Deuteronomy, shared with Howard the meaning of life before returning him to Earth back in his duck form.[83][84]\nHoward the Duck tried to sue the directorGeorge Lucasover a film, and was represented byGoodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway.[85][86]\nAs an interdimensional non-human being, Howard was compelled to register under theSuperhuman Registration Actalong with Beverly.[7]He attempted to do so during theCivil War[87]but learned that his socially disruptive life had created so many bureaucratic headaches that the U.S. government's policy was that Howard, the so-called infamous \"Duck Man of Cleveland\", did not exist. This lack of government oversight delighted Howard: \"For the rest of my life... no more parking tickets - or taxes - or jury duty. Heck, I couldn't even vote if I wanted to! This is even better than Christmas in Vegas! I no longer officially exist!\"[7][88]\nAfter he defeatedM.O.D.O.T.'s scheme to control the public through the mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, had him registered with the government. including all relevant responsibilities and the President made him a citizen with a full presidential pardon.[89]\nAt some point, Howard was made part of theOhio Initiative, but the team was eventually shut down by the Feds for unrevealed reasons.[10]He was subsequently made an agent ofA.R.M.O.R., and was hired byMorbius the Living Vampireon a private mission to travel through the multiverses of different types of zombies and collect a sample of each one of them. Before he could go, he was to search forMachine Manand recruit him. One week after being enrolled, Howard found Machine Man drunk and depressed, for his girlfriendJocastawent back to her former husbandUltron. Howard was able to convince Machine Man to join him on their mission.[90]\nThe Fearsome Four\nDuring theFear Itselfevent, Howard formed a team called theFearsome Fourwith theShe-Hulk,Frankenstein's Monster, andNighthawkto stop theMan-Thing, who found himself driven to an uncontrollable rage caused by the immense levels of fear generated by theSerpent'shammer-wieldersacross the world.[91]Facing various alternate universe heroes and thePsycho-Man, brought to Earth by the Man-Thing's connection to theNexus of All Realities,[92]the Four were eventually able to confront their own fears and calm the Man-Thing, bringing an end to his rampage and saving the world, before going their separate ways.[93]\nCynical Duck and Swizzle\nHoward and Bev were both brainwashed and forced to work forS.O.O.F.I.as Cynical Duck and Swizzle. They promoted S.O.O.F.I. at a public speech held for them byJ. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man interrupted a S.O.O.F.I. indoctrination at theNew York Public Library, and Bev and the other S.O.O.F.I.s saw Spidey as a semi-demonic figure and attacked him. Spidey escaped with Howard and broke his brainwashing because Bev was being threatened. Howard quickly explained S.O.O.F.I.'s goals to Spider-Man. As Spider-Man publicly announced his long-standing support for S.O.O.F.I., Howard confronted Bev as she stood by theSupreme S.O.O.F.I.. Howard broke through to Bev, reminding her of their past. The leader ordered the S.O.O.F.I.s to throw the pair into the special Blanditron atGuantanamo Bay, and Bev kept them at bay with her whip. Spidey attacked them and unmasked the Supreme S.O.O.F.I., while the others escaped though their teleporter. Howard believed S.O.O.F.I. would lay low for a while after such a defeat, and also hoped their Florida Everglades base might lead them to meet up with the Man-Thing.[12]\nThe Ducky Dozen\nBecause of his experience with zombie-infested worlds and his leadership of Machine Man, Howard was chosen as the leader of, as he dubbed them, theDucky Dozen.[94]The team was comprised of himself, several Golden Age heroes,Dum Dum Dugan, andBattlestar, who was also a veteran of a zombie incident. Upon enteringEarth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fought hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffered grave losses as most of the members were either killed or zombified in battle.[95]After successfully accomplishing their mission Howard, Dugan, Taxi Taylor, and Battlestar were the only members left that had survived and returned toEarth-616along with theRiveter, the only survivor of Earth-12591's resistance team theSuffragists.[96][97]\nHoward teamed up with his friendDoopto battle Robo-Barbarians in Dimension ZZZ. They beat the horde back with nothing but a broken sword, a rubber chicken with nails in it, and a gun that shot bees.[98]\nAfter the death ofUatu the Watcherand the activation of the secrets buried in his eye, Howard discovered that he had the potential to be the most intelligent being in Duckworld. After evading a squirrel while driving, he was thrown flying and used his intellect to calculate his way to land safely in a dumpster.[22]\nHoward returned to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as theShe-Hulkin Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by theBlack Cat. With the help ofTara Tam, a new ally, Howard managed to recover the necklace, but on his way to give it back to Richards he found himself kidnapped by theCollector,[99]allied with theGuardians of the Galaxyto escape the villain's collection,[100]and confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him.\nDuring his third attempt at recovering the necklace, from the Ringmaster this time, Howard was approached by Richards, who revealed himself to be theSkrullTalos the Untamed, and explained the true nature of the stone in the necklace: it was one of the several Abundant Gems.[101]Once Talos fled the scene, Howard and Tara sought the help ofDoctor Strangeto learn more about these Abundant Gems. Joined by theHuman Torch, the heroes failed to beat Talos in the race for the final gem, and the villain made himself more powerful with theAbundant Glove.[102]In the middle of the battle, during which Tara publicly revealed his shapeshifting abilities to help fight the energy constructs that were created by Talos, Howard managed to snatch the Abundant Glove from the alien villain and defeat him.[103]\nHoward eventually set out to return to his home dimension, and traveled toFloridato find theNexus of All Realitiesin order to reach this goal. However, his attempt to use theCompassion Gemof theAbundant Gloveto help him find his way home merged him with the Nexus.[104]The fusion turned Howard into a Living Nexus which could also be used to teleport to different destinations willingly instead of randomly, as the Nexus normally acted. Howard's new-found powers caught the attention of numerous people who desired to use Howard for their own ends, including gender-bent clones of Howard andRocket RaccoonnamedLindaandShocket Raccoon, who wanted to rescue everyone trapped inCollectonand escape to another universe.\nHoward agreed to help Linda and Shocket, and on their way to Collecton, they were pursued by bothSkrullsand theStranger.[105]Howard was seemingly rescued from the Stranger's clutches byScout, a cosmic-powered girl who wanted to give Howard as a gift toGalactusand prove herself worthy of being his new Herald. With the help of theSilver Surferand theGuardians of the Galaxy, Howard's allies rescued him.[106]Using a portion of thePower Cosmicgranted to him by the Silver Surfer, Howard brought his allies to Collecton and helped both defeat the Collector and free its prisoners, who used Howard's powers as the Living Nexus to return to their homes. When Howard was separated from the Nexus and used it to return home, he was accidentally sent to the doorstep of Bev's new house.[8]Following a bittersweet and brief reunion, Howard returned to New York.[107]\nWhile investigating a case for actressLea Thompson, Howard discovered that the nefariousMojoof theMojoversehad turned him into the unwitting protagonist of his own reality show. However, in order to ensure Howard's life remained interesting for the ratings, he had hired the services ofChippandJho, two members of the race ofreality warpersknown as theSparkitects, who had subtly influenced Howard's life and been responsible for most of his recent misadventures.[108]\nThe two Sparkitects became directly involved with Howard's confrontation against Mojo after realizing that the villain could find out that Howard discovering the reality show was an attempt by them to shut down Mojo's program and cut off all ties with him. When Howard confronted Chipp, the Sparkitect stabbed and killed him.[19]However, Jho's attempt to redeem his wrongs brought Howard back to life, after manipulatingDoctor Strangeinto returning his soul to his body.\nDuckworldian Physiology:Howard's body, like those of his entire race, has similar characteristics to those of both common Earth ducks and common Earth human beings. He has hands and arms instead of wings, is covered with feathers and is unable to fly. Howard is similar to a human athlete who has trained his body to the fullest. Howard can stay alive in the space vacuum without suffering any harmful effects, even without using any type of suit that protects him from the environment or provides him with oxygen.[109][106]\nEnhanced Duckworldian Speed:After his training Howard has improved his speed, moving faster than the human eye can see.[5]\nSuper Reflexes and Precision:Howard's reflexes have been honed to the point of utmost precision, allowing him to allegedly move faster than the eye can see. He is also capable of catching a knife being thrown at him.[5]\nMystical Training:TheSorcerer SupremeDoctor Strangehas also briefly tutored Howard in the mystic ways, indicating even those of Duckworld possess magical potential.[109][110][111][112][113]Under his mental guidance, Howard was capable of conjuring theVapors of Valtorr, theShield of the Seraphim, use transformation enchantments and even utilize anotherEye of AgamottoandCloak of Levitationalong with his own garb forHoward the Duck, which the duck was able to command, despite his lack ofSorcerer Supremetitle, though ultimately declining to study as Strange's apprentice. Dr. Strange has claimed that Howard has incredible potential, making him one of the most powerful sorcerers.[36]\nLiving Nexus:Howard was temporarily merged with theNexus of All Realities, allowing him to act as a gateway to the Multiverse. When somebody touches him, he can choose where they will travel or they can make their own choice. He can also create an entirely new universe with his own specifications and can be tracked by cosmic beings and ships acting like an \"cosmic ark.\"[105]\nMartial Arts:Howard is a master in the little-known martial art calledQuak Fu, which he learned at the hands ofMaster C'haaj,[5]and hence is a surprisingly formidable opponent in hand-to-hand combat, which allows him to defeat opponents that are more powerful than himself.[109]\nWillpower:As part of his Quak Fu training, Howard reached a new state of consciousness and developed an immense willpower. Howard can use his will to break down material barriers with easy sum, apparently increasing his strength.[5]\nSuper-Fast Learning:During his martial arts training, Howard dominated the irrelevance of chronological time, giving him the ability to master a life of studies and training in just three hours and seventeen minutes.[5]"

The Guardians of the Galaxy crash landed on Collecton and Linda, Shocket, and Tara set out to find Howard, as well as free other prisoners.\nWhile the Silver Surfer and Scout fought the Collector, Tara found Howard, who allowed the prisoners to use him to teleport themselves to where they wanted to go. The Collector blasted the Silver Surfer and Scout before turning his attention to Howard and attempting to kill him, believing that the Nexus would split from him as a result. Howard was saved by Star-Lord's phasing powers and she threw him onto the Collector, so he could teleport him away.\nFour hours later, Rocket detected no life forms after circling the planet other than the Gatherers and the Collector's former guards. Howard teleported Linda and Shocket to Mirvos-12 and Tara to Earth before the Silver Surfer seemingly separated him from the Nexus, but Scout observed that he was still connected to it. The Silver Surfer revealed that this meant only he could override its random nature and that Howard could go wherever he wanted. Howard entered the Nexus and teleported to a house near the ocean on Earth and was reunited with Beverly.\nTHE EPIC CONCLUSION!\n• A cosmic battle to end all battles with Howard in the middle! Can he put an end to THE COLLECTOR once and for all with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy and Silver Surfer?"

To prove his point, Howard and Beverly are bumped into by a young man who is imitating some of the moves that he saw in the movie. Telling the boy off, Howard and Beverly go into a diner for some food. Shortly after, the boy is thrown through the diner's window by Count Macho, a master of kung-fu and a self proclaimed macho man who will not stand for any effrontery to his manhood.\nWhen Howard tries to talk Macho out of beating the boy a fight erupts in the diner that increases in size as more patrons get up to fight Macho and his hoods. During the scuffle, the boy is stabbed by Macho, and his gang leaves shortly after. When Howard tries to stop them Macho beats Howard, however Howard pulls off Macho's pendant.\nIn the ensuing chaos, Howard manages to back the crowd away so that Beverly can administer first aid until the authorities can arrive and take him away, Beverly goes with the paramedics leaving Howard to stew over what happened. Hoping to relax by browsing in an adult book store, Howard comes across a who rack of magazines devoted to Kung-Fu. Further disgusted by the wanton glamorization of violence, Howard browses through one of the magazines and happens upon an ad for Master C'haaj, who promises to teach the secrets of any fighting style.\nDeciding to beat Count Macho at his own game, Howard goes to Master C'haaj's school where he is welcomed as C'haaj's newest pupil and begins his training. Meanwhile, Beverly is told at the hospital that the boy had died in surgery. Leaving the hospital, Beverly is then captured by Macho's thugs.\nBack at the martial arts school, Howard trains his mind and body in the art of Quack-Fu and becomes a master of the fighting style in just under three hours. Given a fighting outfit, Howard suddenly finds himself back outside the adult book store as if the fighting school vanished. Rushing home to tell Beverly of his experience, Howard finds a note on the door from Macho demanding his pendant back. Howard goes to the meeting place and beats all of Macho's goons, and in the fight with Macho, Howard is able to deflect all of Macho's attacks. In a fit of rage, Macho jumps at Howard, who moves out of the way and Macho plummets off the sky scraper to his death. After the two reflect on the whole incident, believing that Macho deserved his fate, but not liking the idea that he had died."

Brought before the judge, the Kidney Lady tells a sob story about how when she was a young woman she was seduced and ran away from home with a spiritual book seller, and after being wined and dined in Cleveland she woke up one morning to find him gone, leaving a note saying that he had been drafted. She tells the judge, that she has kept the last thing he left for her, a copy of the book he was selling \"The Human Kidney, Seat of the Soul\" and that she has tried her best to live by its teachings. That, weighed against Howard's violent outburst during her story, and Winda's confession that she was going to Cleveland for an exorcism, convinces the judge that the Kidney Woman is free to go and sentences Howard and Winda to spend time in the Sauerbraten County Medical Facility.\nThere, the two are processed by nurses and while Winda is interviewed by Doc Avery, Howard is locked in a padded room until the isolation makes him willing to take the medication that the nurse brings to him. Listening to Winda's story, Doc Avery tells her that the home address she gave them belongs to a vacant lot, leaving Winda to believe her family has left her. The Doc tells her that they may arrange for an exorcism (something he will do to prove that one isn't needed) and takes Howard in. However, Howard isn't so responsive as he is in a drug induced stupor. Their interview is cut short when there is a scream from outside. Going out to check it out, Howard and Doc Avery are shocked to see the rock band Kiss materializing out of Winda's head."

May quickly changes the subject and suggests to Peter that he proposes to Anna. Peter nervously drinks water and tries to think of a way to explain his aunt that they are just friends, but Anna simply says that they broke up some time ago and she hasn't been able to find an apartment, to May's annoyance.\nAs Peter and Anna then go toParker Industries, she tells him that he is used to his life being complicated that he over complicates things all the time. She suggests that he swings them back to Parker Industries. He protests, but she tells him that people will just assume that Spider-Man is saving her again. He eventually agrees and suggests that they stop some blocks away from Parker Industries as Spider-Man and Parker are no longer supposed to be associates but Anna tells him that no one bought that.\nAt the Parker Industries Beta Testing Lab,Sajanicomplains that they are spending time and resources in a super villain prison, pointing out that they always break out and they will be a joke after the first escape.Clayton Coledefends the idea, saying that the point is about reforming the criminals and that Peter hired him because he believes he can do better than his life as Clash and many villains just need a chance like him.\nA security guard interrupts them, telling Sajani that the security system has been glitching on and off. She is surprised since she had the system upgraded after theBlack Catbroke in. Peter and Anna then arrive and Sajani is more then surprised, since she was supposed to get a text from Peter when he arrived to discuss the budget together. Anna tells her that Peter has a secret door in his lab, which he uses to meet Spider-Man; much to Peter's and Sajani's annoyance.\nAnna tells him she doesn't like secrets and that that's why they split up. In the Security Hub, theGhosthas deactivated the phones and internet and sealed all the exits. He considers every employee, from the C.E.O. to the security guard, guilty. The guard then appears to investigate the glitch, and the Ghost tells him that he is setting the world free, starting with him before phasing his arm through the guard's chest.\nBack in the Testing Lab, Peter starts testing the security measures for the new prison, including security orbs, S.W.A.T.-bots and hard-light walls. The Ghost then turns the security measures against the employees. Peter tries to override them, but the Ghost appears in a screen and tells him that nothing will work. He admits he is impressed by their work and will have them hold in Parker Industries as he brings it down.\nA employee tries to escape and Peter saves him from a bot, which start taking each out. Anna tells them that she is broadcasting a frequency that messes their guidance system, also giving a cover for Peter to use his powers. He then tells the Living Brain to protect the staff and take them to an exit, which he does and starts getting damage. Anna worries and tells Sajani that their secret nano tech project is backed in his memory only since they don't want Peter to find out. The Living Brain makes a way to the secret door in Peter's lab, which Anna tells the staff Spider-Man uses to get his tech to establish a good reason for him to be there. The staff enters while Peter stays to seal the lab and Anna notices Sajani isn't with them.\nMeanwhile, the Ghost is seeing the staff leaving the lab and decides to continue elsewhere and is approached by Sajani. She recognizes that somebody paid him and offers to show him the best way to destroy the prison project beyond repair if he lets the other projects alone and doesn't hurt any one.\nThe Ghost admits she is a good negotiator and that she will get far in the business world, but he can't have that since he doesn't sabotage corporations for the money, he hates them and wants them dead. Peter changes to Spider-Man and hears a scream, he gets to the Ghost just as he phases his arm through Sajani's chest.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nTwo years ago,Felicia Hardypresents a painting in an elite party. In the present day at a museum,Regina Venderkamp, the woman who bought all the items confiscated from the Black Cat in an auction, presents the same painting that Felicia did.\nHowever, the lights go out for a moment and the painting is gone. An enraged Regina and her bodyguards go to her apartment only to find all of her treasures gone. She goes upstairs to see if she also took everything there, despite a bodyguard protesting since the Black Cat could still be there.\nFelicia then appears and says she couldn't leave without Regina learning that no one takes from the Black Cat without paying. Regina orders her bodyguards to attack, but Felicia quickly takes the out. She reflects that her bad luck powers seem to work better when she is ruthless and she may have been holding back before. She throws one of her claws to Regina's neck, causing her to pass out.\nHour later, Regina wakes up handcuffed to a chair at the Black Cat's hideout. Felicia contemplates almost all of the items that were confiscated and those she retrieved, with only one missing. InJay'sandMay'sapartment, they contemplate the last item, the only thing they got at the auction, and go watch TV unaware that the Black Cat plans to steal it back.\n• The Ghost has invaded Parker Industries!"

They were the “shining city on a hill”. They felt it was their obligation to impart their knowledge to other less advanced races. They tried, but instead of giving them haikus or something like that they gave them fission technology. The result was predictable, and the race’s first experiment with altruism was their last. Embarrassed the race retreated into passive observance of the universe. They were called theWatchers. From the Watchers there is a splinter group that feels they have to comment on what they see. They are called the Critics. Ten years ago, one of the Critics was watching the debris of a shattered solar system as it approached the event horizon of one of his favorite black holes. The event was interrupted by a cosmic aberration. A giant plunger landed on the black hole and reversed the suction turning it into the only known trans-dimensional blowhole. The cause is still a mystery.\nShe-Hulkholds a black shape up. Weezi calls out that the car engine just died. She-Hulk says that she isn’t surprised, and that the force emanating from the thing is incredibly powerful. She says that she is getting woozy just touching it. Weezi asks if that thing is the magnetic anomaly. She-Hulk says that she will tell her after she gets her bearings. She says that the thing is playing havoc with her inner ear, and that it is hard to stand up. Suddenly an energy stream coils out of the black shape and circles around She-Hulk trapping her. She-Hulk is spun around like a top out onto the surface of a frozen lake. The friction from the spinning melts the ice and She-Hulk falls through. Weezi calls out to She-Hulk as She-Hulk surfaces. Weezi asks if she is all right. She-Hulk says that everything but her pride is fine. Weezi notes that something happened to the anomaly. She says that it is now an empty frame and that the black surface is gone. She-Hulk says that the weird emanations have stopped too. She-Hulk is thinking maybe the dunking neutralized it, but when she puts her hand through the frame her hand disappears out of the other side. She-Hulk wants to know where her hand went.\nIn Cleveland,Howard the Duckstands horrified as a green hand in a Gucci glove is reaching out for his throat from out of the back of his refrigerator. He slams the door shut. When he opens the door again the hand is gone. He decides that he has been drinking too much diet soda, and that he is just having “phenylalanine hallucinations”. He says that will make interesting conversation when Bev comes home.\nWeezi asks if all five of the fingers came back. She-Hulk says that they are all back and covered with milk. Weezi asks if She-Hulk is bringing the thing back with them. She says that she would just bury it. She-Hulk says that she can’t, and that they still don’t know enough about it. She says that she needs someone like Reed Richards, or a guy she knows from college that teaches theoretical physics at ESU, to look at it. Weezi notices that She-Hulk’s teeth are chattering. She-Hulk says that she has been cold since her dip in the freezing pond. Weezi says that she thought ordinary variations in temperature weren’t supposed to bother She-Hulk. She-Hulk says that it isn’t supposed to because of her gamma radiation. She-Hulk says, “Uh-oh.”\nAt Wormwall, New York State correctional facility, in the cell ofFloyd Mangles, the warden is holding a box with items found in Floyd’s cell. He says that there is a coffee mug, an old shoe, a candy bar wrapper, and a plunger. Floyd says that he has had that stuff for a long time, and that no one objected. The guard tells the warden that is untrue. He says that they inspect the cell twice a day and that if that box was there they would have found it. Floyd asks the warden what he thinks the guard would say. The warden asks why he has the items since none would be useful in an escape or in a fight. Floyd says that he uses them for meditation. The warden says to let him keep the objects, and that he will schedule counseling for Mr. Mangles. Outside the cell, the warden asks what Floyd’s story is. The guard says that he doesn’t know, and that he was there years before him. The warden says that he outdates him as well. He decides that he should look at his file. Inside the cell, Floyd says that he is getting careless and that he forgot to hide the box under his drop cloth of invisibility. He decides that it doesn’t matter since the Big Squish is coming, and that nothing can stop it.\nBev comes home in her ninja outfit. Howard asks how work was. Bev says that it was slow, and that she thinks that she might have become a ninja a little too late. Howard says that he told her that before. Bev tells him not to rub it in. Bev says that it sounded good on the commercial. Howard says that he also said that if enough ninjas were out of work that they would resort to teaching. Bev says that she was told the rent-a-ninja agency would have something better for her tomorrow. She says that it has to be better than guarding a shopping mall art sale. Bev asks if there is any more diet soda. Howard says that it is in the fridge, but warns her not to let the big green arm grab her.\nIn New York City, Weezi asks She-Hulk is she is sure that she doesn’t want her to stay the night. She-Hulk says that it is nothing, and that she just feels a little tired. She adds that she is unable to walk or even stand as she falls over. Weezi helps She-Hulk and asks what has come over her. She-Hulk says that she doesn’t know, and that her knees just turned to Jell-O. She says that she hasn’t felt so sick since she got the transfusion that turned her into the She-Hulk. Weezi tells She-Hulk to rest and says that maybe the anomaly taxed her more than she thought. She-Hulk says that could be it.\nThe Critic is pacing back and forth and says that he knew ten years ago when the blowhole was created that he would find himself in the worst scenario for one of his species… he has to make a decision. He says that one of the compaction receptacles has already landed on Earth. He says that its seal has been breached twice: from within by the creature that possessed Wildmoon and from without by She-Hulk. He says that Earthlings can’t keep their fingers out of anything. He figures that when the other receptacles land on Earth that there will be an orgy of poking until all the seals are broken and the cosmos will be plunged into chaos. He thinks about dumping this on the Watcher in Earth’s sector but decides that is too cowardly. He searches for some other indigenous life form. He finds one and starts flying to it.\nThe next day atEmpire State University, She-Hulk goes to seeProf. Brent Wilcoxwith the anomaly. He says that she couldn’t reach Reed Richards and so she came to him. She-Hulk says that he is the only other theoretical physicist she knows. He says that he is the only unmarried one as well. He asks if they can try to figure it out over dinner. She-Hulk says that she isn’t feeling very well, and that with the way it ended last time between them that she doesn’t think it is a good idea. Brent’s hand recoils out of the frame. He says that it felt like sticking his hand in liquid nitrogen. She-Hulk says that her hand just felt refrigerated. Brent suggests that it may be there relative positions. He says that she was in Vermont, but that he is in New York City. She-Hulk asks if the stuff inside the box varies because of where it is. Brent says that what changes is what is on the other side. She-Hulk blows on Brent’s fingers to warm them up. She asks what he means by other side. Brent says that it is like sticking a knitting needle through a rubber ball. Brent regains movement in his fingers. She-Hulk says that she doesn’t get it. Brent drops a pen into the frame and watches as it keeps falling. She-Hulk asks what is in the frame. Brent says that he is guessing that it is another universe. He says that he thinks that the universe is being compressed. He says that it is like a trash compactor.\nThe Critic nears Cleveland and says that the one he needs is there.\nInside, Howard the Duck asks if he has can help. The customer asks if he is the salesman, but says that he is a duck. Howard says that he knows DOS and can type with all eight fingers. The woman with the man says that is unusual. Howard says that he is overcompensating for obvious reasons. The Critic appears and says, “Howard!” The man and the duck both turn. The Critic says that he is looking for the duck. Howard guesses that he didn’t come for the word processing demonstration. The Critic says that he has come from beyond the stars to discuss the salvation of Howard’s universe. Howard says that this isn’t his universe, and that he is with a customer. Howard starts to stomp off, but Critic places him in a bubble. He says that his creed prevents him from revealing the precise location of the danger, but that it does require his non-Terran instincts. They blast through the roof of the store with Howard trapped in the bubble. He asks if his creed says anything about who is going to pay for the roof.\nBrent has the frame on a flat surface with a telescope aimed into it. He figures that maybe with the “back door” closed they might be able to look inside. He looks inside. She-Hulk asks what he sees. Brent says that She-Hulk won’t believe it unless she looks for herself. Jen looks in the telescope and sees cold cuts and other assorted things for making sandwiches. She says that she can’t wait for an explanation on this one. Brent says that he doesn’t know that he has one, but that it does jibe with his alternate universe theory. He says that if there are multiple universes that there must be some way to control the principles governing how many survive. A sort of natural selection for universes. He figures that universes not viable on their own and those that encroach on other universes would be eliminated. She-Hulk asks if he really thinks about this stuff all day long. Brent says that he does. He says to suppose that the encroaching universes could only be contained and not eradicated. He says that the frame could be a way of quarantining them.\nThe Critic zooms by the window and releases Howard.\nHoward comes crashing through the window. She-Hulk dodges, but Brent’s head gets stuck in the frame. Howard smashes against the wall and the bubble dissolves. She-Hulk offers Howard a hand, but he recognizes her hand as the one coming out of the refrigerator and starts running for it. She-Hulk says that she was just offering him a hand. Howard says that he would worry about the guy sinking into the desk. She-Hulk looks over to see Brent falling all the way into the frame. She-Hulk reaches in after Brent, but only brings out a bratwurst. She-Hulk says that she got Brent into this, and that he has no other choice than to go in after him. Howard asks when the “hairless apes” will learn. He says that there is always a choice. He starts to walk out, but She-Hulk grabs him. She says that he isn’t going anywhere until she figures out how he got into all this. She says that until she is sure that he isn’t dangerous that she is staying with her. Howard says that she has five feet on him. Howard says that She-Hulk’s shoulders will never fit through the frame.\nA de-hulked Jennifer Walters.\nInside the Baloney-verse, Jen says that they have to find Brent and get out of there. Howard looks over and says that he doesn’t mean to get personal, but that it looks like she has lost a few pounds since they passed through the frame. She-Hulk has reverted into her Jennifer Walters form."

The two went to Greenwich Village to enlist the aid of Doctor Strange. When they arrived, Wong revealed that Doctor Strange was preoccupied, battling the demon Thog in the Realms of Deet-Ko, only for Howard to disregard this and enter a portal.\nAfter entering the portal, Howard found himself surrounded by various grotesque-looking creatures who asked if he was there to play \"the game\" and threw him into a portal, where he found Doctor Strange and Thog playing \"the game\", actually just gambling, on the other side.\nHoward revealed that Talos acquired the Abundant Gem and he returned with Doctor Strange to the Sanctum Sanctorum, where Wong was waiting. Howard claimed to have saved Doctor Strange's life and the Sorcerer Supreme reluctantly went along. While Wong went to tend to the Sorrow Plants of Narticus in the garden, Doctor Strange told Howard about the Abundant Glove and the five gems that formed it and revealed that together, the gems could destroy the world. Then, Doctor Strange tapped into the ether and tracked down one of the gems to Pier 4 before instructing Wong to summon the Human Torch to Pier 4.\nDoctor Strange flew Howard and Tara to the Hudson River, where the Human Torch arrived and introduced himself to Tara. Upon Doctor Strange's request, the Human Torch recalled owning a gem that he acquired a gem on Battleworld, during Secret Wars, and planned to give it to Zsaji in order to win her back from Colossus, but was unable to after she died and brought it back to Earth. Then, the Human Torch revealed that he lost track of the gem after Pier 4 was destroyed, then pointed to Bohemian Valhalla, where Pier 4 used to be. Doctor Strange tried to locate the gem, using the Eye of Agamotto, but he and his companions were attacked by Talos, who acquired the final gem. Howard insisted that the Human Torch call for reinforcements.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nHoward walked through the park, looking for his client, and learned that his client was the White Rabbit, who tied him up and stole a formula from his pocket that would allow her to shrink. The White Rabbit hoped the formula was for Pym Particles, but was disappointed when she learned it was a recipe for low-fat cake. Then, Ant-Man enlarged to regular size. Due to not having handcuffs, Howard tied up the White Rabbit with rope and revealed that she had paid him eight-hundred in advance to \"steal\" the formula, so Ant-Man decided to charge eight-hundred for his ticket from Miami and his \"security services.\"\n• Looks like the \"doctor is in\" ... this issue ofHOWARD THE DUCK!Ha ha of course I'm referring to Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme.\n• I'm 100% positive nobody's ever made that joke before, so I feel pretty confident doing so here.\n• There will be other jokes of a similar nature in this issue."

They arrived in New York nearly instantly and Howard's taxi was surrounded by locals. Shoals snapped his fingers and they zoomed to a parking space, where he dismounted and paid Howard with a Dimensional Express traveler's check, although Howard refused to accept it. When Shoals realized that he should have paid with dollars, instead, he returned to Howard and offered to take him along on his case. Howard was not interested at first until Shoals mentioned the Cosmic Key.\nShoals led Howard to Barqu Bookshop, where he tracked the key to and met its proprietor R.L. Haney, who had never heard of the Cosmic Key. Shoals revealed that the Cosmic Key originated on his homeworld, Maltesia, and that he prevented Pro-Rata from acquiring the key by causing it to vanish through one of the inter-dimensional doors opened by his spells, as well as his journey tracking the key to Barqu Bookshop. Then, Shoals learned that Haney had the key the whole time, but knew nothing about it, moments before the Uncanny Cockroach snatched it and revealed that he needed it to exist. The Uncanny Cockroach revealed that when he was a non-sentient cockroach living inside of the bookshop's drawers, he came into contact with the key and metamorphosed, as a result, and needed it to rule the world and mutate other cockroaches.\nHoward, Shoals, and Haney, as well as a mob of locals chased the Cockroach into the old Coach Hotel. One of the people on the hotel's second floor sprayed him with Raid aerosols before the mob found him again. Howard ambushed the Cockroach when he made it to the fourth floor and trapped him by spreading paste across the floor, walls, and ceilings, then offered to free him in exchange for the key. After Howard acquired the key, the Cockroach attacked him before Haney threw Shoals' walking stick and threw the dagger tip at him, causing him to revert to his original form.\nAfter recovering the key, Shoals declared that Howard had \"as much right to it\" as anyone else and offered to let him use it. Howard did not trust himself with it and Haney did not want it and claimed that nobody would believe him if he wrote about it, so Shoals used the key to change the name of Coach Hotel to \"Roach Hotel\", so that people would remember the day's events. When Howard entered his taxi, Shoals snapped his fingers, causing the former to quickly find himself in Cleveland, although facing the wrong way in a one-way street.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nChapter One:Howard, Bev, Winda, and Paul took a free trip to Dreadcliff Manor through a supermarket coupon none of them remembered filling out. As Howard was about to turn on the lights for his room, Miss Danberry ordered him not to, claiming that the storm outside had disrupted the power lines, and lit candles instead. As, Miss Danberry led Winda and Paul to their room, Howard grew suspicious, but Bev just wanted to relax.\nTwo days ago, as Howard and Bev came home from the supermarket when a man named J. Michael Anthony visited him and claimed that Howard had won a sweepstakes for an all-expense-paid vacation to Dreadcliff Manor. At the manor, Howard expressed to Bev that he believed that they should have passed on the trip. While looking outside of the window, Howard saw a man. Bev, who was lying on a bed, disregarded his concern, but attempted to turn on a lamp to check if the electricity was back on. When she pulled a switch, the bed turned over, causing her to fall into a shaft and Howard alerted Winda and Paul. Winda helped Howard search for Beverly and was grabbed from behind in the closet and accidentally flicked the light switch, causing Howard to fall into a shaft under the bed.\nWhile in the shaft, Howard saw a door in a wall and entered a room before seeing what appeared to be a ghost. The \"ghost\" was actually a man wearing a cloth and he and Miss Danberry, who was actually Nurse Barbara in a mask, kept Bev and Winda inside of a cage. Winda recognized Nurse Barabra, who revealed to her that she first exhibited mental powers at the mental hospital and gathered Sinister Soofi, Reverend Joon Moon Yuc, Mahagreasy Migraine Yogi, and Werner Blowhard. Nurse Barbara also revealed that they wanted Winda and Howard, as they had both experienced contact with the cosmic axis and that their leader Dr. Reich formulated a theory that the cosmic axis may present a pathway to the minds of the masses.\nChapter Two: Fuhrer Knows Best!Dr. Reich, the leader of B.E.S.T. -- Bozoes Eagerly Serving Tyrants, revealed himself and declared his intent to do mankind's thinking for them by ridding their minds of originality with Formula 410. Howard watched their meeting, as B.E.S.T. took Winda and planned to use her mind to gain access to the Cosmic Axis and project their control onto the minds of the entire world. When Dr. Reich learned that his generals did not capture Howard, he ordered them to search for him.\nWhen Howard saw Paul sleepwalking around the manor, he placed a knight's helmet and a bedsheet on him and used him to scare B.E.S.T. before Nurse Barbara hit him with a mace. Howard, who was wearing another suit of armor, attacked Nurse Barbara and her colleagues attacked him, reducing his armor. Winda saw that Paul wasn't moving and summoned previously uncontrollable visions from other planes to terrorize Dr. Reich. Dr. Reich shot his pistol at the visions, accidentally killing Mahagreasy Migraine Yogi and breaking the chain that held the cage holding Bev. After Bev was freed, she pulled Howard out from the armor torso and kicked Reverend Yuc out of a window. As Nurse Barbara was about to hit Howard, Paul, who finally woke up, tripped her, causing her to throw her mace at Werner Blowhard's face. Sinister Soofi grabbed Howard from behind, but accidentally sprayed Formula 410 at Dr. Reich, causing him to relive Hitler's final moments of World War II by shooting himself in the head. Although Dr. Reich believed that he was Hitler, he was really not and was actually Hitler's dentist and replaced his own teeth with Hitler's dentures."

Duckworld resembles mankind's Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. He was the son of aRonaldandHenrietta, a working class Roman Catholic couple living in New Stork. He had two siblings,TheresaandOrville.[21]As a child, he discovered an amazing potential intellect; however, he was continuously bullied by other children as a result. He eventually decided to give up on his studies, wasting his potential.[22]Further details about Howard's past on Duckworld are still unknown. Indeed, there are conflicting accounts as to the circumstances surrounding his disappearance.\nHoward vanished from his home world when the power-hungry demon-lordThog the Nether-Spawnused his demonic powers to cause the interdimensional cosmic axis to shift. Howard was dislodged from his home dimension and dropped into the middle of theFloridaEverglades onEarth-616at the site of this world'sNexus of All Realities, a place from which travel to all other dimensions is said to be possible. In an effort to set the Cosmic Axis right and return home, the reluctant Howard joined withKorrek of Ktharta, who also came from another dimension, the young Earth-born sorceressJennifer Kale,Dakimh the Enchanter, and theMan-Thing, the guardian of the Nexus. The battle against Thog ended for Howard when he fell off the other-dimensional Stepping Stones of Oblivion.[23][24][25]\nHe landed back onEarth-616in the city ofCleveland,Ohio, where he first faced the menace ofGarko, the Man-Frog.[26][27]\nHoward the Duck wanted to establish a reputation in Cleveland. As such, he sought to earn a position on the Cleveland police force by catching this mysterious farm stalker. During the investigation, he foundBessie the Hellcow, who attacked him, but Howard kept her at bay with a cross. During the fight, he used a mallet and wooden stake to seemingly end the blood-sucking bovine's hellish existence once and for all. Despite his heroism, however, Howard was still denied a position on the Cleveland police force, much to his dismay.[28][29]\nIn Cleveland, Howard first met the young life modelBeverly Switzlerwho was a captive of the costumed criminal accountantPro-Rata. Howard and Beverly escaped and began living together.[30]\nAlthough Howard attempted to live as normal a life as possible, considering that he was a talking duck on a world of human beings, he continually ran afoul of various unusual menaces including theTurnip Man,[31]Count Macho,[5]theWinky-Man,[32]Emile \"The Goat\" Klout[33]and theGingerbread Man.[34]\nHoward came to public notoriety when he became a candidate for the United States Presidency on a very minor party ticket.[35]He was even the target of an assassination plot as someone hiredDoctor Angstand his group, theBand of the Bland, to kill him. Howard defeated his would-be assassins with the help of theDefendersand they were sent to prison.[36]As it turned out, the assassination was unnecessary as the general populace refused to believe that Howard was a real talking duck, thinking of him instead as a dwarf in a duck suit. As a result, the public dismissed his candidacy as a joke.[37]\nHe continued to battle villains such as theBellhop,[38]Le Beaver,[39]Kong Lomerate,[40]theKidney Lady,[41]theRev. Joon Moon Yucand the Yuccies,[42]andRoxxon.[43]\nHis most notable arch-nemesis wasDoctor Bong. Through cleverness, persistence, and just plain good (if not dumb) luck, Howard always managed to either defeat or escape from his adversaries.[44]\nHoward went up against a hate group calledS.O.O.F.I.(SaveOurOffspringFromIndecency) who were \"trying to restore order to the world\".[45]\nWhile relaxing in his apartment Howard was attacked by a salt shaker with arms and legs on a giant housefly, but they were unable to defeat him. Dakimh and the Man-Thing arrived to ask Howard for his help and he was reluctantly transported to the Castle in the Sky over the Land Between Night and Day, where they were reunited with Korrek and Jennifer Kale. Dakimh brought them there to battle the demonBzzk'joh.[46]Bzzk'jho attacked them and Jennifer was forced to use her power to bring NAAC-P30 and 2-2 2-2, two Druid Droids that helped Howard, Korrek, and the Man-Thing stop jho. When Howard still refused to help, Korrek threatened Howard. Howard conceded when he tried to use the gun that was given to him by Dakimh and it turned out only to shoot a comedic flag. Riding Dakimh's spaceship, theEpoch Weasel, into the universe to get to jho's kingdom, the Imperium Emporium, the group escaped one of their delivery truck weapons. However, their ship was damaged, forcing them to land at the Hollywok Cantina. There they tried to find transport, dealing with real Californians and being told to speak to Big Mac about getting transport. Korrek tried to do so politely; however, he violently attacked Mac when he refused them transport, causing the real Californians to attack them. Howard managed to dispel them using the Farce through his gun, incapacitating them all. Securing a new ship, the group managed to burst into Bzzk'joh's base, the Death Store, a giant spaceship themed after a box store. There they fought through jho's armies and freed Jennifer, escaping just as the Death Store was set to explode, destroying jho and all of his followers.[47]They returned Howard toEarth-616New York, but he experienced nothing but trouble when he tried to help out a few New Yorkers[48]\nAfter finally meeting up with the cruise ship that rescued Paul and Winda, now befriended by socialite Iris Raritan, he attended her party onLong Island, where he was abducted by theRingmasterand hisCircus of Crime. Paul was shot and left in a coma, and Winda, abandoned by Paul and Iris, was apparently assaulted by a hobo.[49]After defeating the Circus of Crime Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, went his own way, as he had at the beginning of the series.[50][51]Howard then returned to Cleveland.[52]\nIron Duck\nHe battled Doctor Bong and teamed up withClaude Starkowitz, a former Vietnam vet who believed that he was related toTony Stark, the personal armorer toIron Man, and the genius behind the creation ofIron Man's Armor. Claude created for Howard a suit of Iron Man-inspired armor with springs and a built-in flamethrower, plus a device which would, hopefully, neutralize Bong's powers. Lee and Howard returned to the hospital, where Bong appeared to challenge Howard just as they finished setting up.[4]He used his bell to freeze everyone; however, it did not effect Howard who was protected not only by his armor but by cotton balls stuffed in his ears. The two engaged in a battle across the hospital, where Howard, in spite of being greatly outmatched, was able to lure Dr. Bong to the device which negated his powers. However, the device malfunctioned and Bong managed to grab Howard. With only one compartment untried, Howard opened up the armor's hip unit to find a small hammer. Remembering what happened to Bong the last time that he hit the bell on his head, Howard took the hammer and hit Bong on the head with it. The resulting peel from the bell transported both Bong and Howard away and freed everyone from Bong's paralysis. Howard and Bong rematerialized in Bong's castle, where Bong used his bell to strip Howard of his armor and removed his cotton balls. However, before Bong could finish Howard off, Beverly stopped him, showing him cloned babies that she she made and threatened to send a letter to the media, outing him as a negligent parent. Conceding and taking the cloned children, Dr. Bong angrily teleported Howard and Beverly back to the hospital. There they were reunited with Lee and Winda, who had come out of her coma.[53]\nNow living in Cleveland again, Howard battled new weird adversaries.[54]\nWhen Howard was on his way home from the laundromat, he was attacked out of the blue byDracula. Realizing Howard was not human he fled. Howard now started to displayvampire-like tendencies. He changed into traditional vampire garb and tried to attack Winda. Mistaking his bloodthirst for lust, Bev kicked Howard out of the house. The sometime-vampire hunterHarold H. Haroldcame looking for Howard and explained that his affliction was purely a disillusion. After a few failed attacks due to not having any teeth, they found him and tried to snap him out of the disillusion. Dracula arrived and tried to turn Bev into a vampire, but Howard staked him with a piece of a picket fence. Seeking immortality and listening to the dying Dracula claiming that he could give it to him, Harold foolishly removed the stake, and Dracula turned him into a vampire. Three days later, Howard read of reports of Harold clawing his way out of his grave.[55]\nHoward and Beverly on Duckworld\nHoward and Beverly arrived onDuckworldonEarth-791021. On this world, Beverly was considered the freak of the pair. Howard was eventually realized to have been the \"Drake\" who had vanished a few years back. Initially fleeing from overzealous worshipers, Howard led Beverly back to his former home, the base of the WACkies (Witness to theAscensionCult), and they learned what theRev. Godfrey Ganderhad done. Howard spoke up to the crowd, denouncing Rev. Godfrey and revealing the message that he had intended for them. Though initially reluctant, theDuckworldiansagreed to start thinking for themselves, while Gander vowed vengeance for losing his franchise. Howard worked to win his people over to Beverly, appearing with her onThe Tonight Showwith Johnny Quackson. In a \"This is Your Life\" pastiche, Howard was reunited with his parents and his sister Theresa, now a nun, and his brother Orville, now a mortician. However, the next guest,Dr. Ludwig von Cluck, actually a paid agent of Gander, attempted to use his Surrogate Sniffer super-vacuum machine to expose Beverly as a robot. It instead exposed her by tearing off all of her clothes. The appearance of a naked human appalled the Duckworldians. Howard and Beverly fled alongside fellow guest Truman Capoultry. A former ally of Gander, Capoultry wished to follow Howard's word and helped them escape. To help them return to Earth, Capoultry brought them toDucktor Strange, Mallard of the Mystic Arts, who was a drunk and living in an alley. Before Strange could do anything, the Rev. Gander,Scrounge McDrake, and their allies showed up and attempted to gun down Howard, Bev, Capoultry, and Strange. Bev kicked a trash can into their attackers, after which they overpowered them one-by-one. Strange cast a spell sending them back toEarth-616, and while Gander saw this as a chance to revive the WACkies, Capoultry vowed to write a new book telling the true story of Howard, which would foil Gander's plans.[21]\nArriving back in Earth-616, at the Nexus of All Realities in Florida, they teamed up with the Man-Thing again to battleKong Lomerate.[56]Howard and Bev got jobs at a retirement home inMiamiwhere they ran afoul of the grand designs of the Grey Panther.[6]The pair wound up inNew Orleanswhere Bev was kidnapped by theBlack Talonas an intended sacrifice of a voodoo cult.[57][58]\nHoward, working as a taxicab driver, had driven a customer to New York all the way from Cleveland. This man, calling himselfStatus Quo, was a mild-mannered librarian when the constant advent of new fads drove him to madness. Wanting to destroy all fads, Status Quo began studying how the media and advertisers help encourage fads, and came to New York in order to speak to people and convert them to his anti-fad group. This eventually led to a giant demonstration in Central Park where surprisingly, Status Quo managed to gather a large crowd and earn himself a legion of followers. These followers were armed with gimmicked fads (rocket-powered skateboards, exploding Frisbees, etc.) and sent out to attack anyone who supported any kind of fad. The chaos brought the attention ofSpider-Manwho tried to quell the mob, and prevent them from spreading beyond Central Park, while Howard was chased after by some anti-fad goons who thought he was trying to perpetuate a fad himself. Spider-Man eventually teamed up with Howard and the two managed to expose Status Quo as a hypocritical terrorist in front of live news cameras, discrediting him and causing his followers to break up. Afterwards, Howard and Spidey split up, and Howard returned to his cab where he found a police officer waiting for him to write him up on a number of traffic violations.[59]\nHoward was inSan Franciscoon Christmas Eve where he was on theGolden Gate Bridge, depressed and contemplating suicide. He was stopped by anAngelcalledAndy. Andy decided to try and boost Howard's confidence and morale; he showed Howard how the lives of its friends would have unfolded if Howard had never come toEarth-616. He showed HowardEarth-83234. They visited his friendsPaul Same,Arthur Winslow, andBeverly Switzler. To Howard and Andy's horror, all of his friends’ lives would have been better off without him. Believing that he had failed and that his life was worse than Howard's because he believed that would never get his wings, Andy considered suicide himself, but Howard succeeded in stopping him from doing so. Howard offered to buy Andy a drink rather than having either of them kill themselves. This act ironically won Andy his wings because, after all, itwasa successful mission.[60]\nHoward broke up with Beverly at her request. After that, he was mistaken for \"Duck Drake, Private Eye\".[57]He then metCeci Ryderwhen hitchhiking and battled theGopher, afterwards ending up back in Cleveland.[61]\nHoward later won 10 million dollars from the American Garden and Family grand prize contest. However, the fun and the fame changed him, causing him to lose contact with Bev. Dr. Dwight Clive convinced him to use the rest of his money to create a mate for himself. Using cell samples, he createdAlexis the Duck, but unwittingly used a brain taken from the body of the spoiled wife of a personal injury attorney. Alexis turned out to be a bitter gold digger who left Howard. Broke, he returned home to Cleveland.[16]\nThe Whoatcher had heartburn and created a cosmic burp that accidentally zappedSpider-HamofEarth-8311and Howard into an alternate dimension. They emerged onEarth-905237in the castle ofDucktor Doom. Working together they battled Doom, but the Whoatcher took some antacids, neutralizing the effects of the cosmic burp. Howard and Spider-Ham were sent home before the burp happened and disrupted Doom's weapon, which was the perfect synthesis between science and magic and with which he had intended to conquer the world. Howard felt that he got off easy, but then Ducktor Doom materialized in the alley behind him.[62]\nMeeting the She-Hulk\nTheShe-Hulkaccidentally pulled Howard through a cosmic wormhole, along with physicistBrent Wilcox, and prevented other universes from crowding outEarth-616.[63]Howard met the Critic, traveled to the Baloneyverse, and battled Dr. Angst and the Band of the Bland again.[64]\nIn California,ChamberandSkinofGeneration Xhitchhiked down a highway. After several cars flew past them, one of the vehicles stopped to offer the two mutants a ride. The driver of the vehicle was none other than Howard the Duck.[65]Howard and the mutants stopped at a bar to get some drinks, and the bartender informed them that their establishment did not serve ducks. Violence ensued and Howard was forced to rely upon his martial arts training inQuak Futo avoid injury. Chamber unleashed his mutant powers and began questioning the bar patrons about someone named Tores. To everyone's surprise,Miguela Toreswas actually a sultry young woman with a green stripe tattooed across her right eye. She entered the bar and began asking questions. While Chamber and Howard dealt with Tores, Skin sneaked away from the bar. He disguised himself as an old man and went to the cemetery to visit his own grave. There, he met his mother and managed to console her without letting on that he was, in fact, her son.[66]Outside in the Bio-Sphere, Howard and his girlfriend Bev arrived.Franklin,Artie, andLeechwere thrilled at the notion of having a talking duck to pal around with. Howard had no real interest in hanging out with children, but the kids dragged him to their treehouse. Inside they foundTana Nile. Tana was a Rigellian who crash-landed on Earth a short while ago. Leech had been sneaking her food from the school, and no one but the children were even aware of her presence.[67]Howard tried to find a way to get the children to safety.Black Tom Cassidyraided the tree house and prepared to kill them. Howard drove Black Tom back by setting him on fire with the lit end of his cigar. As the treehouse erupted into flames, Howard, Artie, Franklin, Leech, and Tana Nile discovered the Man-Thing present on the estate. Recognizing that the Man-Thing is the gateway into the dimensional rift known as the Nexus of All Realities, Howard convinced the others to dive into the creature's slimy body in the hopes of escaping. Their plan appeared to work and they disappeared inside the Man-Thing’s body.[68]\nHoward and the Daydreamers\nHoward and theDaydreamerswent sailing through the inter-dimensional byways of the Nexus, floating on a broken chunk of Earth. No one could really understand what was happening to them and Howard began to have a panic attack. Tana kept his attitude in check and reminds him that their first responsibility was to look after the children. Artie fell asleep and projected a vision of his nightmare: a dark, menacing shadowy figure. Before long, the Daydreamers arrived in a surreal fantasy world known as Nevernever-Narnozbia. Their earthen sled landed atop a woman (who looked suspiciously a lot like theScarlet Witch) known as the Red Witch of the Southeast, squashing her flat. A bunch of rocky little stone Things ran out to greet the visitors, expressing their happiness that the witch was finally dead. Suddenly, a man in drag named Strange arrived and thanked them for saving Nevernever-Narnozbia from the threat of the witch. Franklin expressed his desire to return home and Strange used the Eyeliner of Agamotto to direct them towards the King of the realm. Meanwhile, Howard the Duck was separated from the group and came upon a magic lamp. Rubbing the lamp, he summoned agreen goblin-likegenie who granted him three wishes. Howard wished for a way out of this mess, and the genie provides him with a DeSoto. Driving along in the antique car, he eventually met back up with his friends only for them to become prisoners of the King. The King bore a strong resemblance toDoctor Doom– an old foe of theFantastic Four. The Daydreamers tried to escape, and a fight broke out in the King's throne room. The dark spectral figure from Artie's vision arrived and declared that he had come for Franklin Richards.[69]\nThe Dark Hunter attacked theDaydreamersproclaiming that he had come for Franklin Richards. The Daydreamers could not decide which was stranger: the evil villain standing before them,Doctor Strangein drag, or the fact that the Man-Thing could suddenly carry on a conversation.Leechtried to siphon away the Dark Hunter's powers, but to no avail.Franklinasked Strange if he could send them home. Strange could not send them back to Earth, but instead used his magic wand to send them to another realm altogether. The group arrived in a bizarre cartoon-liked reality, which appeared as if it were crafted from the mind of Dr. Seuss. Weird creatures were seen walking down the streets with distended lips and large tufts of hair on their heads. Like the characters from Dr. Seuss, everyone had a penchant for speaking in rhyme. The Daydreamers stopped at a local diner to collect their thoughts. The staff at the diner became irate with Howard, who absolutely refused to speak in rhyme. Franklin placated the offended food servers by ordering their meals in rhyme for them. It did little good, however, as the Cadence Police arrived to arrest the Daydreamers. Howard wanted to start a fight with them, butTanaconvinced him that allowing them to be taken to jail might actually serve their better interests. Suddenly,Artiebegan to distrust Franklin. He continued to have visions of the Dark Hunter and felt that Franklin was connected to the Hunter in an unhealthy fashion. Franklin lashed out at him, declaring that he should mind his own business. Later that night, the Dark Hunter came for them. Tana Nile ripped the bars off of their prison cell and they broke free. She tried to keep the Dark Hunter at bay, but was unable to penetrate his shadowy form. Howard tried to get the Man-Thing to transport them back home, but the Man-Thing explained to him that he cannot control the power of the Nexus. Regardless, the Daydreamers dove into his slimy body and accessed theNexus of All Realities. When they exited, they found themselves onDuckworld– the planet of Howard's birth. They looked around in shock and awe as they saw a large bronze statue of Howard the Duck in the town square. To all accounts, Howard appeared to be a hero of the people.[70]\nCrowds of people began swelling around the new arrivals, eager to welcome their hero home. In an effort to keep the excited mob at bay, Tana Nile picked up the Man-Thing and began swinging him about like a baseball bat. The Daydreamers ducked down an alleyway and stealthily made their way towards Howard's home. Howard did not know why he was being hailed as a great hero and frankly, he did not care. The Man-Thing began to lose his cohesion, and Tana had to help him along. They arrived at the house of Howard's parents, June and Ward. It was an idyllic two-story home with a perfectly manicured lawn and a white picket fence. June and Ward came out to greet the newcomers and they welcomed Howard with open arms. Following a quick repast, Howard decided that he had had enough of this. He knew that this was not his true family and that his home life was never this perfect. As he shook his head in denial, the imagery washed away and all of it was revealed to be an illusion. Meanwhile, the Man-Thing continued to fall apart. Tapping into the cosmic energies of theNexus of All Realitieshad proven too taxing for his physical form and he could no longer maintain his cohesion. Before long, the Dark Hunter arrived on Duckworld and continued his pursuit ofFranklin Richards. The Daydreamers left Howard's phony household and proceeded to a place known as the Richards Institute. Inside were two-dimensional cartoon versions of Franklin's parents,ReedandSusan Richards. The Dark Hunter tracked them down and they soon realized what the Hunter actually was – he was the living embodiment of Franklin Richard's repressed emotions. When the Daydreamers first interacted with the Nexus of All Realities, it reacted with Franklin's dormantmutantpowers, creating a conduit into a pocket dimension inside Franklin's subconscious mind. Franklin never came to terms with the fact that his parents were gone – victims of the villain known asOnslaught. In his grief, he fabricated an imaginary, illusory world where he could effectively hide from his pain. Now having confronted his own fears in the form of the Dark Hunter, Franklin was finally ready to let go of his parents. As Franklin's pocket reality ceased to exist, the Daydreamers exited the Nexus of All Realities. They were back onEarth-616in the FloridaEverglades, and the Man-Thing was back to his normal, inarticulate self.[71]\nWhile the Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian of Franklin, Howard went off on his own and was captured by theCult of Entropy.[72]Although he was last seen him in the swamp, he stated that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wanted him because he had part of the Nexus of All Realities, which had shattered duringHeroes Reborn, inside him, which he knew because it was making him nauseous. The Man-Thing entered his gullet, and Howard vomited him back out with the fragment, but the former was left desiccated and practically dead.[73]\nHe then encounteredNamor the Sub-Mariner, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explained that he would not be lugging his friend's body if that were the case. Howard set the Man-Thing down in the water, and he revived during the conversation with Namor. Once he saw that the Man-Thing was alive and well, he bid Namor farewell and told him that he was returning to Cleveland.[74]\nHe worked withSpider-Man (Ben Reilly)in a fight against the Circus of Crime, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting theSavage DragonandDestroyer Duck. The group left in the belief that they had brought the correct Howard with them.[75]\nJennifer Kale attempted to return Howard home many times, but he accused her and Doctor Strange of being responsible for bringing him toEarth-616. She accidentally teleportedDevil DinosaurandMoon Boyinto her New York apartment.[76]The disoriented dinosaur attempted to eat Howard, but spat him out when he was shot with theGhost Rider'sHellfire Shotgun. They then went on a rampage through the city before being subdued by theGhost Rider. Howard related to the pair, being trapped in a world he was never meant to be in, and wandered off.[77]\nHoward got a job as a department storeSanta Claus, which got him dragged to theNorth Pole, where the realSanta Claushad sold out toHydra.[78]\nHoward the Duck in mouse form\nBeverly obtained a job at a company that was owned by Doctor Bong who turned Howard into a mouse, but the process was unstable and he cycled through different forms before settling on the mouse form again.[79]Bong joined withKenneth Floggto gain theAmulet of Pazuzu, but Howard obtained it first, gained its power, and used it to slay Flogg's assistant,Ian Whippingham.[80]They next stayed at theBoarding House of Mystery, joining their fellow tenant,Splatter Gomorrah, in exposing talk show hostIprahas a marketing franchise.[81]However, she was possessed by the angel-demon hybridDeuteronomy. Howard used the cigar of the Saint of Therapists,Sigmund Freud, to banish Deuteronomy; however, he decided to take a puff of the cigar which disintegrated him and sent him toHell.[82]He was saved byGodHimself who, grateful for him dealing with Deuteronomy, shared with Howard the meaning of life before returning him to Earth back in his duck form.[83][84]\nHoward the Duck tried to sue the directorGeorge Lucasover a film, and was represented byGoodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway.[85][86]\nAs an interdimensional non-human being, Howard was compelled to register under theSuperhuman Registration Actalong with Beverly.[7]He attempted to do so during theCivil War[87]but learned that his socially disruptive life had created so many bureaucratic headaches that the U.S. government's policy was that Howard, the so-called infamous \"Duck Man of Cleveland\", did not exist. This lack of government oversight delighted Howard: \"For the rest of my life... no more parking tickets - or taxes - or jury duty. Heck, I couldn't even vote if I wanted to! This is even better than Christmas in Vegas! I no longer officially exist!\"[7][88]\nAfter he defeatedM.O.D.O.T.'s scheme to control the public through the mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, had him registered with the government. including all relevant responsibilities and the President made him a citizen with a full presidential pardon.[89]\nAt some point, Howard was made part of theOhio Initiative, but the team was eventually shut down by the Feds for unrevealed reasons.[10]He was subsequently made an agent ofA.R.M.O.R., and was hired byMorbius the Living Vampireon a private mission to travel through the multiverses of different types of zombies and collect a sample of each one of them. Before he could go, he was to search forMachine Manand recruit him. One week after being enrolled, Howard found Machine Man drunk and depressed, for his girlfriendJocastawent back to her former husbandUltron. Howard was able to convince Machine Man to join him on their mission.[90]\nThe Fearsome Four\nDuring theFear Itselfevent, Howard formed a team called theFearsome Fourwith theShe-Hulk,Frankenstein's Monster, andNighthawkto stop theMan-Thing, who found himself driven to an uncontrollable rage caused by the immense levels of fear generated by theSerpent'shammer-wieldersacross the world.[91]Facing various alternate universe heroes and thePsycho-Man, brought to Earth by the Man-Thing's connection to theNexus of All Realities,[92]the Four were eventually able to confront their own fears and calm the Man-Thing, bringing an end to his rampage and saving the world, before going their separate ways.[93]\nCynical Duck and Swizzle\nHoward and Bev were both brainwashed and forced to work forS.O.O.F.I.as Cynical Duck and Swizzle. They promoted S.O.O.F.I. at a public speech held for them byJ. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man interrupted a S.O.O.F.I. indoctrination at theNew York Public Library, and Bev and the other S.O.O.F.I.s saw Spidey as a semi-demonic figure and attacked him. Spidey escaped with Howard and broke his brainwashing because Bev was being threatened. Howard quickly explained S.O.O.F.I.'s goals to Spider-Man. As Spider-Man publicly announced his long-standing support for S.O.O.F.I., Howard confronted Bev as she stood by theSupreme S.O.O.F.I.. Howard broke through to Bev, reminding her of their past. The leader ordered the S.O.O.F.I.s to throw the pair into the special Blanditron atGuantanamo Bay, and Bev kept them at bay with her whip. Spidey attacked them and unmasked the Supreme S.O.O.F.I., while the others escaped though their teleporter. Howard believed S.O.O.F.I. would lay low for a while after such a defeat, and also hoped their Florida Everglades base might lead them to meet up with the Man-Thing.[12]\nThe Ducky Dozen\nBecause of his experience with zombie-infested worlds and his leadership of Machine Man, Howard was chosen as the leader of, as he dubbed them, theDucky Dozen.[94]The team was comprised of himself, several Golden Age heroes,Dum Dum Dugan, andBattlestar, who was also a veteran of a zombie incident. Upon enteringEarth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fought hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffered grave losses as most of the members were either killed or zombified in battle.[95]After successfully accomplishing their mission Howard, Dugan, Taxi Taylor, and Battlestar were the only members left that had survived and returned toEarth-616along with theRiveter, the only survivor of Earth-12591's resistance team theSuffragists.[96][97]\nHoward teamed up with his friendDoopto battle Robo-Barbarians in Dimension ZZZ. They beat the horde back with nothing but a broken sword, a rubber chicken with nails in it, and a gun that shot bees.[98]\nAfter the death ofUatu the Watcherand the activation of the secrets buried in his eye, Howard discovered that he had the potential to be the most intelligent being in Duckworld. After evading a squirrel while driving, he was thrown flying and used his intellect to calculate his way to land safely in a dumpster.[22]\nHoward returned to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as theShe-Hulkin Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by theBlack Cat. With the help ofTara Tam, a new ally, Howard managed to recover the necklace, but on his way to give it back to Richards he found himself kidnapped by theCollector,[99]allied with theGuardians of the Galaxyto escape the villain's collection,[100]and confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him.\nDuring his third attempt at recovering the necklace, from the Ringmaster this time, Howard was approached by Richards, who revealed himself to be theSkrullTalos the Untamed, and explained the true nature of the stone in the necklace: it was one of the several Abundant Gems.[101]Once Talos fled the scene, Howard and Tara sought the help ofDoctor Strangeto learn more about these Abundant Gems. Joined by theHuman Torch, the heroes failed to beat Talos in the race for the final gem, and the villain made himself more powerful with theAbundant Glove.[102]In the middle of the battle, during which Tara publicly revealed his shapeshifting abilities to help fight the energy constructs that were created by Talos, Howard managed to snatch the Abundant Glove from the alien villain and defeat him.[103]\nHoward eventually set out to return to his home dimension, and traveled toFloridato find theNexus of All Realitiesin order to reach this goal. However, his attempt to use theCompassion Gemof theAbundant Gloveto help him find his way home merged him with the Nexus.[104]The fusion turned Howard into a Living Nexus which could also be used to teleport to different destinations willingly instead of randomly, as the Nexus normally acted. Howard's new-found powers caught the attention of numerous people who desired to use Howard for their own ends, including gender-bent clones of Howard andRocket RaccoonnamedLindaandShocket Raccoon, who wanted to rescue everyone trapped inCollectonand escape to another universe.\nHoward agreed to help Linda and Shocket, and on their way to Collecton, they were pursued by bothSkrullsand theStranger.[105]Howard was seemingly rescued from the Stranger's clutches byScout, a cosmic-powered girl who wanted to give Howard as a gift toGalactusand prove herself worthy of being his new Herald. With the help of theSilver Surferand theGuardians of the Galaxy, Howard's allies rescued him.[106]Using a portion of thePower Cosmicgranted to him by the Silver Surfer, Howard brought his allies to Collecton and helped both defeat the Collector and free its prisoners, who used Howard's powers as the Living Nexus to return to their homes. When Howard was separated from the Nexus and used it to return home, he was accidentally sent to the doorstep of Bev's new house.[8]Following a bittersweet and brief reunion, Howard returned to New York.[107]\nWhile investigating a case for actressLea Thompson, Howard discovered that the nefariousMojoof theMojoversehad turned him into the unwitting protagonist of his own reality show. However, in order to ensure Howard's life remained interesting for the ratings, he had hired the services ofChippandJho, two members of the race ofreality warpersknown as theSparkitects, who had subtly influenced Howard's life and been responsible for most of his recent misadventures.[108]\nThe two Sparkitects became directly involved with Howard's confrontation against Mojo after realizing that the villain could find out that Howard discovering the reality show was an attempt by them to shut down Mojo's program and cut off all ties with him. When Howard confronted Chipp, the Sparkitect stabbed and killed him.[19]However, Jho's attempt to redeem his wrongs brought Howard back to life, after manipulatingDoctor Strangeinto returning his soul to his body.\nDuckworldian Physiology:Howard's body, like those of his entire race, has similar characteristics to those of both common Earth ducks and common Earth human beings. He has hands and arms instead of wings, is covered with feathers and is unable to fly. Howard is similar to a human athlete who has trained his body to the fullest. Howard can stay alive in the space vacuum without suffering any harmful effects, even without using any type of suit that protects him from the environment or provides him with oxygen.[109][106]\nEnhanced Duckworldian Speed:After his training Howard has improved his speed, moving faster than the human eye can see.[5]\nSuper Reflexes and Precision:Howard's reflexes have been honed to the point of utmost precision, allowing him to allegedly move faster than the eye can see. He is also capable of catching a knife being thrown at him.[5]\nMystical Training:TheSorcerer SupremeDoctor Strangehas also briefly tutored Howard in the mystic ways, indicating even those of Duckworld possess magical potential.[109][110][111][112][113]Under his mental guidance, Howard was capable of conjuring theVapors of Valtorr, theShield of the Seraphim, use transformation enchantments and even utilize anotherEye of AgamottoandCloak of Levitationalong with his own garb forHoward the Duck, which the duck was able to command, despite his lack ofSorcerer Supremetitle, though ultimately declining to study as Strange's apprentice. Dr. Strange has claimed that Howard has incredible potential, making him one of the most powerful sorcerers.[36]\nLiving Nexus:Howard was temporarily merged with theNexus of All Realities, allowing him to act as a gateway to the Multiverse. When somebody touches him, he can choose where they will travel or they can make their own choice. He can also create an entirely new universe with his own specifications and can be tracked by cosmic beings and ships acting like an \"cosmic ark.\"[105]\nMartial Arts:Howard is a master in the little-known martial art calledQuak Fu, which he learned at the hands ofMaster C'haaj,[5]and hence is a surprisingly formidable opponent in hand-to-hand combat, which allows him to defeat opponents that are more powerful than himself.[109]\nWillpower:As part of his Quak Fu training, Howard reached a new state of consciousness and developed an immense willpower. Howard can use his will to break down material barriers with easy sum, apparently increasing his strength.[5]\nSuper-Fast Learning:During his martial arts training, Howard dominated the irrelevance of chronological time, giving him the ability to master a life of studies and training in just three hours and seventeen minutes.[5]"

Then, Howard and Tara introduced themselves to each other and the former introduced himself as a private detective while the latter introduced him to her tattoo parlor Wishful Inking. Howard stopped outside of She-Hulk's office and lashed out at her for not bailing him out as he had asked. Howard turned his attention to Jonathan Richards, who asked him to help him recover a family heirloom from the Black Cat. Howard bragged to She-Hulk about getting a client before she asked him to leave her and her associates alone. He insisted on replacing Hellcat with him as their private investigator.\nAt 10:07 PM, Howard encountered Spider-Man and asked him where Black Cat was, but he claimed to not know and left, much to the duck's annoyance. An angry Howard stopped outside of Wishful Inking, where Tara offered to work for him. He hired her after she revealed that Black Cat lived down the street from her. The new duo trained before they broke into Black Cat's apartment and found the heirloom. Black Cat returned, so Howard and Tara attempted to escape while hearing sirens. The duo encountered the Gatherer when Black Cat, now in her costume, tackled Howard. Spider-Man heard Howard screaming, but failed to reach him before the Gatherer shot Howard, seemingly vaporizing him.\nFifteen hours later, Howard was in a cell with Rocket Raccoon after being captured by the Gatherer.\n• HOT off the pages of the … the post-credits scene at the … the end ofa … popular movie… HOWARD THE DUCK is back!

Duckworld resembles mankind's Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. He was the son of aRonaldandHenrietta, a working class Roman Catholic couple living in New Stork. He had two siblings,TheresaandOrville.[21]As a child, he discovered an amazing potential intellect; however, he was continuously bullied by other children as a result. He eventually decided to give up on his studies, wasting his potential.[22]Further details about Howard's past on Duckworld are still unknown. Indeed, there are conflicting accounts as to the circumstances surrounding his disappearance.\nHoward vanished from his home world when the power-hungry demon-lordThog the Nether-Spawnused his demonic powers to cause the interdimensional cosmic axis to shift. Howard was dislodged from his home dimension and dropped into the middle of theFloridaEverglades onEarth-616at the site of this world'sNexus of All Realities, a place from which travel to all other dimensions is said to be possible. In an effort to set the Cosmic Axis right and return home, the reluctant Howard joined withKorrek of Ktharta, who also came from another dimension, the young Earth-born sorceressJennifer Kale,Dakimh the Enchanter, and theMan-Thing, the guardian of the Nexus. The battle against Thog ended for Howard when he fell off the other-dimensional Stepping Stones of Oblivion.[23][24][25]\nHe landed back onEarth-616in the city ofCleveland,Ohio, where he first faced the menace ofGarko, the Man-Frog.[26][27]\nHoward the Duck wanted to establish a reputation in Cleveland. As such, he sought to earn a position on the Cleveland police force by catching this mysterious farm stalker. During the investigation, he foundBessie the Hellcow, who attacked him, but Howard kept her at bay with a cross. During the fight, he used a mallet and wooden stake to seemingly end the blood-sucking bovine's hellish existence once and for all. Despite his heroism, however, Howard was still denied a position on the Cleveland police force, much to his dismay.[28][29]\nIn Cleveland, Howard first met the young life modelBeverly Switzlerwho was a captive of the costumed criminal accountantPro-Rata. Howard and Beverly escaped and began living together.[30]\nAlthough Howard attempted to live as normal a life as possible, considering that he was a talking duck on a world of human beings, he continually ran afoul of various unusual menaces including theTurnip Man,[31]Count Macho,[5]theWinky-Man,[32]Emile \"The Goat\" Klout[33]and theGingerbread Man.[34]\nHoward came to public notoriety when he became a candidate for the United States Presidency on a very minor party ticket.[35]He was even the target of an assassination plot as someone hiredDoctor Angstand his group, theBand of the Bland, to kill him. Howard defeated his would-be assassins with the help of theDefendersand they were sent to prison.[36]As it turned out, the assassination was unnecessary as the general populace refused to believe that Howard was a real talking duck, thinking of him instead as a dwarf in a duck suit. As a result, the public dismissed his candidacy as a joke.[37]\nHe continued to battle villains such as theBellhop,[38]Le Beaver,[39]Kong Lomerate,[40]theKidney Lady,[41]theRev. Joon Moon Yucand the Yuccies,[42]andRoxxon.[43]\nHis most notable arch-nemesis wasDoctor Bong. Through cleverness, persistence, and just plain good (if not dumb) luck, Howard always managed to either defeat or escape from his adversaries.[44]\nHoward went up against a hate group calledS.O.O.F.I.(SaveOurOffspringFromIndecency) who were \"trying to restore order to the world\".[45]\nWhile relaxing in his apartment Howard was attacked by a salt shaker with arms and legs on a giant housefly, but they were unable to defeat him. Dakimh and the Man-Thing arrived to ask Howard for his help and he was reluctantly transported to the Castle in the Sky over the Land Between Night and Day, where they were reunited with Korrek and Jennifer Kale. Dakimh brought them there to battle the demonBzzk'joh.[46]Bzzk'jho attacked them and Jennifer was forced to use her power to bring NAAC-P30 and 2-2 2-2, two Druid Droids that helped Howard, Korrek, and the Man-Thing stop jho. When Howard still refused to help, Korrek threatened Howard. Howard conceded when he tried to use the gun that was given to him by Dakimh and it turned out only to shoot a comedic flag. Riding Dakimh's spaceship, theEpoch Weasel, into the universe to get to jho's kingdom, the Imperium Emporium, the group escaped one of their delivery truck weapons. However, their ship was damaged, forcing them to land at the Hollywok Cantina. There they tried to find transport, dealing with real Californians and being told to speak to Big Mac about getting transport. Korrek tried to do so politely; however, he violently attacked Mac when he refused them transport, causing the real Californians to attack them. Howard managed to dispel them using the Farce through his gun, incapacitating them all. Securing a new ship, the group managed to burst into Bzzk'joh's base, the Death Store, a giant spaceship themed after a box store. There they fought through jho's armies and freed Jennifer, escaping just as the Death Store was set to explode, destroying jho and all of his followers.[47]They returned Howard toEarth-616New York, but he experienced nothing but trouble when he tried to help out a few New Yorkers[48]\nAfter finally meeting up with the cruise ship that rescued Paul and Winda, now befriended by socialite Iris Raritan, he attended her party onLong Island, where he was abducted by theRingmasterand hisCircus of Crime. Paul was shot and left in a coma, and Winda, abandoned by Paul and Iris, was apparently assaulted by a hobo.[49]After defeating the Circus of Crime Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, went his own way, as he had at the beginning of the series.[50][51]Howard then returned to Cleveland.[52]\nIron Duck\nHe battled Doctor Bong and teamed up withClaude Starkowitz, a former Vietnam vet who believed that he was related toTony Stark, the personal armorer toIron Man, and the genius behind the creation ofIron Man's Armor. Claude created for Howard a suit of Iron Man-inspired armor with springs and a built-in flamethrower, plus a device which would, hopefully, neutralize Bong's powers. Lee and Howard returned to the hospital, where Bong appeared to challenge Howard just as they finished setting up.[4]He used his bell to freeze everyone; however, it did not effect Howard who was protected not only by his armor but by cotton balls stuffed in his ears. The two engaged in a battle across the hospital, where Howard, in spite of being greatly outmatched, was able to lure Dr. Bong to the device which negated his powers. However, the device malfunctioned and Bong managed to grab Howard. With only one compartment untried, Howard opened up the armor's hip unit to find a small hammer. Remembering what happened to Bong the last time that he hit the bell on his head, Howard took the hammer and hit Bong on the head with it. The resulting peel from the bell transported both Bong and Howard away and freed everyone from Bong's paralysis. Howard and Bong rematerialized in Bong's castle, where Bong used his bell to strip Howard of his armor and removed his cotton balls. However, before Bong could finish Howard off, Beverly stopped him, showing him cloned babies that she she made and threatened to send a letter to the media, outing him as a negligent parent. Conceding and taking the cloned children, Dr. Bong angrily teleported Howard and Beverly back to the hospital. There they were reunited with Lee and Winda, who had come out of her coma.[53]\nNow living in Cleveland again, Howard battled new weird adversaries.[54]\nWhen Howard was on his way home from the laundromat, he was attacked out of the blue byDracula. Realizing Howard was not human he fled. Howard now started to displayvampire-like tendencies. He changed into traditional vampire garb and tried to attack Winda. Mistaking his bloodthirst for lust, Bev kicked Howard out of the house. The sometime-vampire hunterHarold H. Haroldcame looking for Howard and explained that his affliction was purely a disillusion. After a few failed attacks due to not having any teeth, they found him and tried to snap him out of the disillusion. Dracula arrived and tried to turn Bev into a vampire, but Howard staked him with a piece of a picket fence. Seeking immortality and listening to the dying Dracula claiming that he could give it to him, Harold foolishly removed the stake, and Dracula turned him into a vampire. Three days later, Howard read of reports of Harold clawing his way out of his grave.[55]\nHoward and Beverly on Duckworld\nHoward and Beverly arrived onDuckworldonEarth-791021. On this world, Beverly was considered the freak of the pair. Howard was eventually realized to have been the \"Drake\" who had vanished a few years back. Initially fleeing from overzealous worshipers, Howard led Beverly back to his former home, the base of the WACkies (Witness to theAscensionCult), and they learned what theRev. Godfrey Ganderhad done. Howard spoke up to the crowd, denouncing Rev. Godfrey and revealing the message that he had intended for them. Though initially reluctant, theDuckworldiansagreed to start thinking for themselves, while Gander vowed vengeance for losing his franchise. Howard worked to win his people over to Beverly, appearing with her onThe Tonight Showwith Johnny Quackson. In a \"This is Your Life\" pastiche, Howard was reunited with his parents and his sister Theresa, now a nun, and his brother Orville, now a mortician. However, the next guest,Dr. Ludwig von Cluck, actually a paid agent of Gander, attempted to use his Surrogate Sniffer super-vacuum machine to expose Beverly as a robot. It instead exposed her by tearing off all of her clothes. The appearance of a naked human appalled the Duckworldians. Howard and Beverly fled alongside fellow guest Truman Capoultry. A former ally of Gander, Capoultry wished to follow Howard's word and helped them escape. To help them return to Earth, Capoultry brought them toDucktor Strange, Mallard of the Mystic Arts, who was a drunk and living in an alley. Before Strange could do anything, the Rev. Gander,Scrounge McDrake, and their allies showed up and attempted to gun down Howard, Bev, Capoultry, and Strange. Bev kicked a trash can into their attackers, after which they overpowered them one-by-one. Strange cast a spell sending them back toEarth-616, and while Gander saw this as a chance to revive the WACkies, Capoultry vowed to write a new book telling the true story of Howard, which would foil Gander's plans.[21]\nArriving back in Earth-616, at the Nexus of All Realities in Florida, they teamed up with the Man-Thing again to battleKong Lomerate.[56]Howard and Bev got jobs at a retirement home inMiamiwhere they ran afoul of the grand designs of the Grey Panther.[6]The pair wound up inNew Orleanswhere Bev was kidnapped by theBlack Talonas an intended sacrifice of a voodoo cult.[57][58]\nHoward, working as a taxicab driver, had driven a customer to New York all the way from Cleveland. This man, calling himselfStatus Quo, was a mild-mannered librarian when the constant advent of new fads drove him to madness. Wanting to destroy all fads, Status Quo began studying how the media and advertisers help encourage fads, and came to New York in order to speak to people and convert them to his anti-fad group. This eventually led to a giant demonstration in Central Park where surprisingly, Status Quo managed to gather a large crowd and earn himself a legion of followers. These followers were armed with gimmicked fads (rocket-powered skateboards, exploding Frisbees, etc.) and sent out to attack anyone who supported any kind of fad. The chaos brought the attention ofSpider-Manwho tried to quell the mob, and prevent them from spreading beyond Central Park, while Howard was chased after by some anti-fad goons who thought he was trying to perpetuate a fad himself. Spider-Man eventually teamed up with Howard and the two managed to expose Status Quo as a hypocritical terrorist in front of live news cameras, discrediting him and causing his followers to break up. Afterwards, Howard and Spidey split up, and Howard returned to his cab where he found a police officer waiting for him to write him up on a number of traffic violations.[59]\nHoward was inSan Franciscoon Christmas Eve where he was on theGolden Gate Bridge, depressed and contemplating suicide. He was stopped by anAngelcalledAndy. Andy decided to try and boost Howard's confidence and morale; he showed Howard how the lives of its friends would have unfolded if Howard had never come toEarth-616. He showed HowardEarth-83234. They visited his friendsPaul Same,Arthur Winslow, andBeverly Switzler. To Howard and Andy's horror, all of his friends’ lives would have been better off without him. Believing that he had failed and that his life was worse than Howard's because he believed that would never get his wings, Andy considered suicide himself, but Howard succeeded in stopping him from doing so. Howard offered to buy Andy a drink rather than having either of them kill themselves. This act ironically won Andy his wings because, after all, itwasa successful mission.[60]\nHoward broke up with Beverly at her request. After that, he was mistaken for \"Duck Drake, Private Eye\".[57]He then metCeci Ryderwhen hitchhiking and battled theGopher, afterwards ending up back in Cleveland.[61]\nHoward later won 10 million dollars from the American Garden and Family grand prize contest. However, the fun and the fame changed him, causing him to lose contact with Bev. Dr. Dwight Clive convinced him to use the rest of his money to create a mate for himself. Using cell samples, he createdAlexis the Duck, but unwittingly used a brain taken from the body of the spoiled wife of a personal injury attorney. Alexis turned out to be a bitter gold digger who left Howard. Broke, he returned home to Cleveland.[16]\nThe Whoatcher had heartburn and created a cosmic burp that accidentally zappedSpider-HamofEarth-8311and Howard into an alternate dimension. They emerged onEarth-905237in the castle ofDucktor Doom. Working together they battled Doom, but the Whoatcher took some antacids, neutralizing the effects of the cosmic burp. Howard and Spider-Ham were sent home before the burp happened and disrupted Doom's weapon, which was the perfect synthesis between science and magic and with which he had intended to conquer the world. Howard felt that he got off easy, but then Ducktor Doom materialized in the alley behind him.[62]\nMeeting the She-Hulk\nTheShe-Hulkaccidentally pulled Howard through a cosmic wormhole, along with physicistBrent Wilcox, and prevented other universes from crowding outEarth-616.[63]Howard met the Critic, traveled to the Baloneyverse, and battled Dr. Angst and the Band of the Bland again.[64]\nIn California,ChamberandSkinofGeneration Xhitchhiked down a highway. After several cars flew past them, one of the vehicles stopped to offer the two mutants a ride. The driver of the vehicle was none other than Howard the Duck.[65]Howard and the mutants stopped at a bar to get some drinks, and the bartender informed them that their establishment did not serve ducks. Violence ensued and Howard was forced to rely upon his martial arts training inQuak Futo avoid injury. Chamber unleashed his mutant powers and began questioning the bar patrons about someone named Tores. To everyone's surprise,Miguela Toreswas actually a sultry young woman with a green stripe tattooed across her right eye. She entered the bar and began asking questions. While Chamber and Howard dealt with Tores, Skin sneaked away from the bar. He disguised himself as an old man and went to the cemetery to visit his own grave. There, he met his mother and managed to console her without letting on that he was, in fact, her son.[66]Outside in the Bio-Sphere, Howard and his girlfriend Bev arrived.Franklin,Artie, andLeechwere thrilled at the notion of having a talking duck to pal around with. Howard had no real interest in hanging out with children, but the kids dragged him to their treehouse. Inside they foundTana Nile. Tana was a Rigellian who crash-landed on Earth a short while ago. Leech had been sneaking her food from the school, and no one but the children were even aware of her presence.[67]Howard tried to find a way to get the children to safety.Black Tom Cassidyraided the tree house and prepared to kill them. Howard drove Black Tom back by setting him on fire with the lit end of his cigar. As the treehouse erupted into flames, Howard, Artie, Franklin, Leech, and Tana Nile discovered the Man-Thing present on the estate. Recognizing that the Man-Thing is the gateway into the dimensional rift known as the Nexus of All Realities, Howard convinced the others to dive into the creature's slimy body in the hopes of escaping. Their plan appeared to work and they disappeared inside the Man-Thing’s body.[68]\nHoward and the Daydreamers\nHoward and theDaydreamerswent sailing through the inter-dimensional byways of the Nexus, floating on a broken chunk of Earth. No one could really understand what was happening to them and Howard began to have a panic attack. Tana kept his attitude in check and reminds him that their first responsibility was to look after the children. Artie fell asleep and projected a vision of his nightmare: a dark, menacing shadowy figure. Before long, the Daydreamers arrived in a surreal fantasy world known as Nevernever-Narnozbia. Their earthen sled landed atop a woman (who looked suspiciously a lot like theScarlet Witch) known as the Red Witch of the Southeast, squashing her flat. A bunch of rocky little stone Things ran out to greet the visitors, expressing their happiness that the witch was finally dead. Suddenly, a man in drag named Strange arrived and thanked them for saving Nevernever-Narnozbia from the threat of the witch. Franklin expressed his desire to return home and Strange used the Eyeliner of Agamotto to direct them towards the King of the realm. Meanwhile, Howard the Duck was separated from the group and came upon a magic lamp. Rubbing the lamp, he summoned agreen goblin-likegenie who granted him three wishes. Howard wished for a way out of this mess, and the genie provides him with a DeSoto. Driving along in the antique car, he eventually met back up with his friends only for them to become prisoners of the King. The King bore a strong resemblance toDoctor Doom– an old foe of theFantastic Four. The Daydreamers tried to escape, and a fight broke out in the King's throne room. The dark spectral figure from Artie's vision arrived and declared that he had come for Franklin Richards.[69]\nThe Dark Hunter attacked theDaydreamersproclaiming that he had come for Franklin Richards. The Daydreamers could not decide which was stranger: the evil villain standing before them,Doctor Strangein drag, or the fact that the Man-Thing could suddenly carry on a conversation.Leechtried to siphon away the Dark Hunter's powers, but to no avail.Franklinasked Strange if he could send them home. Strange could not send them back to Earth, but instead used his magic wand to send them to another realm altogether. The group arrived in a bizarre cartoon-liked reality, which appeared as if it were crafted from the mind of Dr. Seuss. Weird creatures were seen walking down the streets with distended lips and large tufts of hair on their heads. Like the characters from Dr. Seuss, everyone had a penchant for speaking in rhyme. The Daydreamers stopped at a local diner to collect their thoughts. The staff at the diner became irate with Howard, who absolutely refused to speak in rhyme. Franklin placated the offended food servers by ordering their meals in rhyme for them. It did little good, however, as the Cadence Police arrived to arrest the Daydreamers. Howard wanted to start a fight with them, butTanaconvinced him that allowing them to be taken to jail might actually serve their better interests. Suddenly,Artiebegan to distrust Franklin. He continued to have visions of the Dark Hunter and felt that Franklin was connected to the Hunter in an unhealthy fashion. Franklin lashed out at him, declaring that he should mind his own business. Later that night, the Dark Hunter came for them. Tana Nile ripped the bars off of their prison cell and they broke free. She tried to keep the Dark Hunter at bay, but was unable to penetrate his shadowy form. Howard tried to get the Man-Thing to transport them back home, but the Man-Thing explained to him that he cannot control the power of the Nexus. Regardless, the Daydreamers dove into his slimy body and accessed theNexus of All Realities. When they exited, they found themselves onDuckworld– the planet of Howard's birth. They looked around in shock and awe as they saw a large bronze statue of Howard the Duck in the town square. To all accounts, Howard appeared to be a hero of the people.[70]\nCrowds of people began swelling around the new arrivals, eager to welcome their hero home. In an effort to keep the excited mob at bay, Tana Nile picked up the Man-Thing and began swinging him about like a baseball bat. The Daydreamers ducked down an alleyway and stealthily made their way towards Howard's home. Howard did not know why he was being hailed as a great hero and frankly, he did not care. The Man-Thing began to lose his cohesion, and Tana had to help him along. They arrived at the house of Howard's parents, June and Ward. It was an idyllic two-story home with a perfectly manicured lawn and a white picket fence. June and Ward came out to greet the newcomers and they welcomed Howard with open arms. Following a quick repast, Howard decided that he had had enough of this. He knew that this was not his true family and that his home life was never this perfect. As he shook his head in denial, the imagery washed away and all of it was revealed to be an illusion. Meanwhile, the Man-Thing continued to fall apart. Tapping into the cosmic energies of theNexus of All Realitieshad proven too taxing for his physical form and he could no longer maintain his cohesion. Before long, the Dark Hunter arrived on Duckworld and continued his pursuit ofFranklin Richards. The Daydreamers left Howard's phony household and proceeded to a place known as the Richards Institute. Inside were two-dimensional cartoon versions of Franklin's parents,ReedandSusan Richards. The Dark Hunter tracked them down and they soon realized what the Hunter actually was – he was the living embodiment of Franklin Richard's repressed emotions. When the Daydreamers first interacted with the Nexus of All Realities, it reacted with Franklin's dormantmutantpowers, creating a conduit into a pocket dimension inside Franklin's subconscious mind. Franklin never came to terms with the fact that his parents were gone – victims of the villain known asOnslaught. In his grief, he fabricated an imaginary, illusory world where he could effectively hide from his pain. Now having confronted his own fears in the form of the Dark Hunter, Franklin was finally ready to let go of his parents. As Franklin's pocket reality ceased to exist, the Daydreamers exited the Nexus of All Realities. They were back onEarth-616in the FloridaEverglades, and the Man-Thing was back to his normal, inarticulate self.[71]\nWhile the Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian of Franklin, Howard went off on his own and was captured by theCult of Entropy.[72]Although he was last seen him in the swamp, he stated that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wanted him because he had part of the Nexus of All Realities, which had shattered duringHeroes Reborn, inside him, which he knew because it was making him nauseous. The Man-Thing entered his gullet, and Howard vomited him back out with the fragment, but the former was left desiccated and practically dead.[73]\nHe then encounteredNamor the Sub-Mariner, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explained that he would not be lugging his friend's body if that were the case. Howard set the Man-Thing down in the water, and he revived during the conversation with Namor. Once he saw that the Man-Thing was alive and well, he bid Namor farewell and told him that he was returning to Cleveland.[74]\nHe worked withSpider-Man (Ben Reilly)in a fight against the Circus of Crime, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting theSavage DragonandDestroyer Duck. The group left in the belief that they had brought the correct Howard with them.[75]\nJennifer Kale attempted to return Howard home many times, but he accused her and Doctor Strange of being responsible for bringing him toEarth-616. She accidentally teleportedDevil DinosaurandMoon Boyinto her New York apartment.[76]The disoriented dinosaur attempted to eat Howard, but spat him out when he was shot with theGhost Rider'sHellfire Shotgun. They then went on a rampage through the city before being subdued by theGhost Rider. Howard related to the pair, being trapped in a world he was never meant to be in, and wandered off.[77]\nHoward got a job as a department storeSanta Claus, which got him dragged to theNorth Pole, where the realSanta Claushad sold out toHydra.[78]\nHoward the Duck in mouse form\nBeverly obtained a job at a company that was owned by Doctor Bong who turned Howard into a mouse, but the process was unstable and he cycled through different forms before settling on the mouse form again.[79]Bong joined withKenneth Floggto gain theAmulet of Pazuzu, but Howard obtained it first, gained its power, and used it to slay Flogg's assistant,Ian Whippingham.[80]They next stayed at theBoarding House of Mystery, joining their fellow tenant,Splatter Gomorrah, in exposing talk show hostIprahas a marketing franchise.[81]However, she was possessed by the angel-demon hybridDeuteronomy. Howard used the cigar of the Saint of Therapists,Sigmund Freud, to banish Deuteronomy; however, he decided to take a puff of the cigar which disintegrated him and sent him toHell.[82]He was saved byGodHimself who, grateful for him dealing with Deuteronomy, shared with Howard the meaning of life before returning him to Earth back in his duck form.[83][84]\nHoward the Duck tried to sue the directorGeorge Lucasover a film, and was represented byGoodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway.[85][86]\nAs an interdimensional non-human being, Howard was compelled to register under theSuperhuman Registration Actalong with Beverly.[7]He attempted to do so during theCivil War[87]but learned that his socially disruptive life had created so many bureaucratic headaches that the U.S. government's policy was that Howard, the so-called infamous \"Duck Man of Cleveland\", did not exist. This lack of government oversight delighted Howard: \"For the rest of my life... no more parking tickets - or taxes - or jury duty. Heck, I couldn't even vote if I wanted to! This is even better than Christmas in Vegas! I no longer officially exist!\"[7][88]\nAfter he defeatedM.O.D.O.T.'s scheme to control the public through the mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, had him registered with the government. including all relevant responsibilities and the President made him a citizen with a full presidential pardon.[89]\nAt some point, Howard was made part of theOhio Initiative, but the team was eventually shut down by the Feds for unrevealed reasons.[10]He was subsequently made an agent ofA.R.M.O.R., and was hired byMorbius the Living Vampireon a private mission to travel through the multiverses of different types of zombies and collect a sample of each one of them. Before he could go, he was to search forMachine Manand recruit him. One week after being enrolled, Howard found Machine Man drunk and depressed, for his girlfriendJocastawent back to her former husbandUltron. Howard was able to convince Machine Man to join him on their mission.[90]\nThe Fearsome Four\nDuring theFear Itselfevent, Howard formed a team called theFearsome Fourwith theShe-Hulk,Frankenstein's Monster, andNighthawkto stop theMan-Thing, who found himself driven to an uncontrollable rage caused by the immense levels of fear generated by theSerpent'shammer-wieldersacross the world.[91]Facing various alternate universe heroes and thePsycho-Man, brought to Earth by the Man-Thing's connection to theNexus of All Realities,[92]the Four were eventually able to confront their own fears and calm the Man-Thing, bringing an end to his rampage and saving the world, before going their separate ways.[93]\nCynical Duck and Swizzle\nHoward and Bev were both brainwashed and forced to work forS.O.O.F.I.as Cynical Duck and Swizzle. They promoted S.O.O.F.I. at a public speech held for them byJ. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man interrupted a S.O.O.F.I. indoctrination at theNew York Public Library, and Bev and the other S.O.O.F.I.s saw Spidey as a semi-demonic figure and attacked him. Spidey escaped with Howard and broke his brainwashing because Bev was being threatened. Howard quickly explained S.O.O.F.I.'s goals to Spider-Man. As Spider-Man publicly announced his long-standing support for S.O.O.F.I., Howard confronted Bev as she stood by theSupreme S.O.O.F.I.. Howard broke through to Bev, reminding her of their past. The leader ordered the S.O.O.F.I.s to throw the pair into the special Blanditron atGuantanamo Bay, and Bev kept them at bay with her whip. Spidey attacked them and unmasked the Supreme S.O.O.F.I., while the others escaped though their teleporter. Howard believed S.O.O.F.I. would lay low for a while after such a defeat, and also hoped their Florida Everglades base might lead them to meet up with the Man-Thing.[12]\nThe Ducky Dozen\nBecause of his experience with zombie-infested worlds and his leadership of Machine Man, Howard was chosen as the leader of, as he dubbed them, theDucky Dozen.[94]The team was comprised of himself, several Golden Age heroes,Dum Dum Dugan, andBattlestar, who was also a veteran of a zombie incident. Upon enteringEarth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fought hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffered grave losses as most of the members were either killed or zombified in battle.[95]After successfully accomplishing their mission Howard, Dugan, Taxi Taylor, and Battlestar were the only members left that had survived and returned toEarth-616along with theRiveter, the only survivor of Earth-12591's resistance team theSuffragists.[96][97]\nHoward teamed up with his friendDoopto battle Robo-Barbarians in Dimension ZZZ. They beat the horde back with nothing but a broken sword, a rubber chicken with nails in it, and a gun that shot bees.[98]\nAfter the death ofUatu the Watcherand the activation of the secrets buried in his eye, Howard discovered that he had the potential to be the most intelligent being in Duckworld. After evading a squirrel while driving, he was thrown flying and used his intellect to calculate his way to land safely in a dumpster.[22]\nHoward returned to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as theShe-Hulkin Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by theBlack Cat. With the help ofTara Tam, a new ally, Howard managed to recover the necklace, but on his way to give it back to Richards he found himself kidnapped by theCollector,[99]allied with theGuardians of the Galaxyto escape the villain's collection,[100]and confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him.\nDuring his third attempt at recovering the necklace, from the Ringmaster this time, Howard was approached by Richards, who revealed himself to be theSkrullTalos the Untamed, and explained the true nature of the stone in the necklace: it was one of the several Abundant Gems.[101]Once Talos fled the scene, Howard and Tara sought the help ofDoctor Strangeto learn more about these Abundant Gems. Joined by theHuman Torch, the heroes failed to beat Talos in the race for the final gem, and the villain made himself more powerful with theAbundant Glove.[102]In the middle of the battle, during which Tara publicly revealed his shapeshifting abilities to help fight the energy constructs that were created by Talos, Howard managed to snatch the Abundant Glove from the alien villain and defeat him.[103]\nHoward eventually set out to return to his home dimension, and traveled toFloridato find theNexus of All Realitiesin order to reach this goal. However, his attempt to use theCompassion Gemof theAbundant Gloveto help him find his way home merged him with the Nexus.[104]The fusion turned Howard into a Living Nexus which could also be used to teleport to different destinations willingly instead of randomly, as the Nexus normally acted. Howard's new-found powers caught the attention of numerous people who desired to use Howard for their own ends, including gender-bent clones of Howard andRocket RaccoonnamedLindaandShocket Raccoon, who wanted to rescue everyone trapped inCollectonand escape to another universe.\nHoward agreed to help Linda and Shocket, and on their way to Collecton, they were pursued by bothSkrullsand theStranger.[105]Howard was seemingly rescued from the Stranger's clutches byScout, a cosmic-powered girl who wanted to give Howard as a gift toGalactusand prove herself worthy of being his new Herald. With the help of theSilver Surferand theGuardians of the Galaxy, Howard's allies rescued him.[106]Using a portion of thePower Cosmicgranted to him by the Silver Surfer, Howard brought his allies to Collecton and helped both defeat the Collector and free its prisoners, who used Howard's powers as the Living Nexus to return to their homes. When Howard was separated from the Nexus and used it to return home, he was accidentally sent to the doorstep of Bev's new house.[8]Following a bittersweet and brief reunion, Howard returned to New York.[107]\nWhile investigating a case for actressLea Thompson, Howard discovered that the nefariousMojoof theMojoversehad turned him into the unwitting protagonist of his own reality show. However, in order to ensure Howard's life remained interesting for the ratings, he had hired the services ofChippandJho, two members of the race ofreality warpersknown as theSparkitects, who had subtly influenced Howard's life and been responsible for most of his recent misadventures.[108]\nThe two Sparkitects became directly involved with Howard's confrontation against Mojo after realizing that the villain could find out that Howard discovering the reality show was an attempt by them to shut down Mojo's program and cut off all ties with him. When Howard confronted Chipp, the Sparkitect stabbed and killed him.[19]However, Jho's attempt to redeem his wrongs brought Howard back to life, after manipulatingDoctor Strangeinto returning his soul to his body.\nDuckworldian Physiology:Howard's body, like those of his entire race, has similar characteristics to those of both common Earth ducks and common Earth human beings. He has hands and arms instead of wings, is covered with feathers and is unable to fly. Howard is similar to a human athlete who has trained his body to the fullest. Howard can stay alive in the space vacuum without suffering any harmful effects, even without using any type of suit that protects him from the environment or provides him with oxygen.[109][106]\nEnhanced Duckworldian Speed:After his training Howard has improved his speed, moving faster than the human eye can see.[5]\nSuper Reflexes and Precision:Howard's reflexes have been honed to the point of utmost precision, allowing him to allegedly move faster than the eye can see. He is also capable of catching a knife being thrown at him.[5]\nMystical Training:TheSorcerer SupremeDoctor Strangehas also briefly tutored Howard in the mystic ways, indicating even those of Duckworld possess magical potential.[109][110][111][112][113]Under his mental guidance, Howard was capable of conjuring theVapors of Valtorr, theShield of the Seraphim, use transformation enchantments and even utilize anotherEye of AgamottoandCloak of Levitationalong with his own garb forHoward the Duck, which the duck was able to command, despite his lack ofSorcerer Supremetitle, though ultimately declining to study as Strange's apprentice. Dr. Strange has claimed that Howard has incredible potential, making him one of the most powerful sorcerers.[36]\nLiving Nexus:Howard was temporarily merged with theNexus of All Realities, allowing him to act as a gateway to the Multiverse. When somebody touches him, he can choose where they will travel or they can make their own choice. He can also create an entirely new universe with his own specifications and can be tracked by cosmic beings and ships acting like an \"cosmic ark.\"[105]\nMartial Arts:Howard is a master in the little-known martial art calledQuak Fu, which he learned at the hands ofMaster C'haaj,[5]and hence is a surprisingly formidable opponent in hand-to-hand combat, which allows him to defeat opponents that are more powerful than himself.[109]\nWillpower:As part of his Quak Fu training, Howard reached a new state of consciousness and developed an immense willpower. Howard can use his will to break down material barriers with easy sum, apparently increasing his strength.[5]\nSuper-Fast Learning:During his martial arts training, Howard dominated the irrelevance of chronological time, giving him the ability to master a life of studies and training in just three hours and seventeen minutes.[5]"

Spying a tower out in the middle of the river, Howard rides a log there and decides to scale the tower and jump off. As he climbs he realizes that the tower is made out of credit cards. Reaching a window near the top, Howard enters for a rest and comes face to face withBeverly Switzler. Killing a barbarian mystically transformed into a dog by fluke, Howard meets Beverly's captor, Pro-Rata.Pro-Ratais a magician that uses accounting skills in order to command his magic and hopes to obtain the Jeweled Key, that once used at midnight with his cosmic adding machine will allow him to become a god. Explaining his origin, Pro-Rata knocks Howard out.\nWhile in New York City,J. Jonah JamesonsendsPeter Parkeron an assignment toClevelandin order to confirm reports of a talking duck and to take pictures. While back in Cleveland, Howard revives and finds that he's been changed into barbarian garb, he and Beverly are then sent to another dimension to collect the jeweled key. There Howard is mistaken for a hatchling Bahndbird and is attacked by a barbarian on a steed. Howard manages to break his joust causing the barbarian to wipe out and get knocked unconscious. Commandeering his steed, Howard and Beverly travel to the temple of the Jeweled Key.\nThere they find it guarded by stone statues and suspended over a pit of spikes. Putting his mind into how to get the key (and chomping on a cigar to boot) Howard has Beverly hold his helmet over the pit while he flicks his cigar at the rope suspending the key over the pit. The ploy works, the cigar burning through the rope and making the key land in the helmet. Leaving the temple they are attacked by the stone statues and a Bahndbird, which destroys the statues.\nAs the creature approaches Howard and Beverly, they are transported back toEarth, along with the Bahndbird. When Pro-Rata commands Howard to give him the key, Howard tosses it off the tower, however it is caught by the arriving Spider-Man who has been drawn to the tower when it's upper levels were blasted open by the Bahndbird. As Spider-Man battles the Bahndbird, Pro-Rata attempts to blast him with a mystic bolt, however Howard throws his scabbard at the mystic, causing him to misfire and ignite the pollutants in the Cuyahoga instead. In an act of heroism, Howard then knocks himself and Pro-Rata over the edge, however, Howard is saved by Spider-Man, and Pro-Rata lands in the fire to perish alone. After thanking Spider-Man for his help, Howard and Beverly bid the wall-crawler farewell as he webs off to capture the Bahndbird."

When a protesting woman saw that Howard could talk, she fainted. Wally Sidney watched as Howard and Bev spoke to the owner of the store. The Demonstration of Decency's boycotts forced the owner to put clothes on the pets. The owner decided that she would be moving to Dayton. After a woman insulted Howard for not wearing pants, he attacked her, starting a riot.\nHoward and Bev escaped the mob and hid inside of Silverman's T.V. Store, where they watched Mayor Dennis Kucinich denounce the Demonstration of Decency before being spotted by the protesters and running again. They were chased to Sidney Land Conservative Clothing. Its owner, Wally Sidney explained that he was the reason people found unclothed animals problematic, Sidney was originally a solider in World War I who attempted to become a cartoonist after the war, but was constantly rejected. Perchance, he became a haberdasher which became a success, suriving the Great Depression and the World War II years. The 1960s saw a dip in sales, but recovered as hippies were associated with slovenliness. However, the 1970s were a bad era for his line of work, as even mainstream people experimented with fashion so he resorted to clothing animals. Howard was reluctant to wear pants at first, but Wally threatened to let the protesters inside his store if he refused. Howard tried on various outfits before picking a hat, suit, and pair of pants. Going outdoors, the protestors were now happy with Howard. Howard is annoyed with his new appearance, but Beverly said they will both get used to it, where Wally Sidney said \"A dressed duck feels no shame!\"\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nHoward's alarm went off and Bev asked him to turn it off. He wanted to finish dreaming the \"latest installment\" of \"Maim That Duck\", but was alerted when he saw tentacles and claws on the clock. He subsequently destroyed the clock before realizing it was only a nightmare. In the bathroom, Howard scrubbed Bev's back with a brush while she was in the shower, but she seemingly disappeared and Howard believed that the nightmares were premonitions about someone about to enter his life. Then, Bev approached him from behind before they had breakfast. Bev suspected that Dino Digitalis offering them roles had scared him. Howard was offended when Bev served him eggs for breakfast.\nIn the Union Terminal, Pro-Rata cast a spell on a 59 cent breakfast special to use against Howard.\nBack in Bay Village, Howard and Bev met the landlord Cyrus Degree, who learned that the Kidney Lady no longer lived there. Then, Howard and Bev left in Lee's taxi while leaving Winda to sign the lease for them. The taxi arrived in Downtown Cleveland, at Union Terminal, where they saw the set of the movie Duck Rogers and met Dino, who introduced them to his accountant, a disguised Pro-Rata. When Howard shook his hand, he felt that he had seen his manicure before. Digitalis led Howard and Bev to their dressing rooms. Howard realized that the \"dressing rooms\" were actually just bathrooms, found a hole in a wall and used it to peek at Bev, who was changing.\nMeanwhile, Pro-Rata thought about how he used magic to create the movie studio before sending the cast, crew, sets, and even Digitalis to the safety deposit dimension from which they were borrowed. Pro-Rata wanted Howard to provide him with the key to the Cosmic Calculator that would make him Chief Accountant of the universe. When Howard and Bev left their \"dressing rooms\", they encountered Pro-Rata, who trapped them inside. Pro-Rata revealed that he wanted the Jeweled Key that unlocked the Cosmic Calculator and reminded them of how he sent them to another dimension. When Pro-Rata asked for the key, Howard revealed that he had sold it, angering him. Pro-Rata revealed that without the key, his magic would be repossessed and he would be thrown into debtor's prison, so he vowed to use his remaining magic to punish Howard.\nAs Pro-Rata used his magic to alter reality inside of Union Terminal, Howard and Bev boarded a supermarket moon rocket. As the rocket neared Pro-Rata, the Financial Wizard used his magic to cause breakfast (nicknamed the \"Eggs-Men\") to attack Howard and Bev, who flew their rocket into the toast and led the orange juice and coffee into space, freezing them, before defeating Eyeclops and Sizzler. Then, the rocket turned its attention to Pro-Rata before landing on the keyboard of his flying cash register, hitting him. Howard sprung at Pro-Rata and started punching him before the former was distracted and the latter overpowered him and revealed that the Astral Auditor would later summon him. Bev closed the drawer of the flying cash register, causing Pro-Rata to lose his footing. His power had been repossessed as well, so he dragged the entire fiscal other-verse with him, causing a depression on a cosmic scale, \"the Crash of '79.\" As the illusion slipped into recession, Howard and Bev divested their holdings before the reality crumbled.\nHoward and Bev found themselves in the waiting room of Union Terminal and shared a hug."

It opens with a group of men renting out a cabin at a campground. The men appear to be hunters as each carry rifles, pistols, and knives on them. The hunters are paranoid as at every little sound or sight of movement they draw their weapons - preparing to be attacked. When they make it to cabin we're introduced to all them: Bruno, Rollins, Van Slyke, Needle, and the apparent leader of the group - Malone. By now the reader learns that the group men are being pursued by some unknown assailant who has already claimed the lives of two of their other companions.\nShortly after entering the cabin, Van Slyke leans up against the wall and lights a cigarette. Moments later Wolverine's signature claws come ripping through the wall and kill him - disappearing back through the hole. The rest of the men run out of the house looking for their enemy, shooting wildly into the night air and at anything that moves - all the while Wolverine mocking them.\nScared but with nowhere to run, Malone puts Rollins on first watch while the rest of them get some sleep. As he sleeps, Malone starts to dream about the first time Wolverine attacked them. Out on a hunting trip the, then seven, men spot a deer move in the forest. After one of them shoots at it and leaves to find it a cry rings out from the woods. Frightened the group of men yell and shout for their companion but it's Wolverine who responds by throwing the man's dead body in front of them. Shooting at random, the men take off into the night - chased by the clawed mutant.\nMalone violently awakens from his dream. As he sits up he sees someone covered in a sheet lying on the floor. At first, Malone thinks it's Rollins, asleep on his watch, but as the figure rises the Adamantium claws come out and the sheet falls - revealing Wolverine. In shock, Malone sits there while Wolverine turns around and says: \"Remember Iraq?\" before jumping through the window and disappearing into the night. Yet again Malone attempts to chase after Wolverine but loses him again, only finding the body of Rollins outside the cabin.\nHaving no choice, the three surviving men (Malone, Needle, and Bruno) set out into the woods. As they travel along Malone and Needle try and remember what had happened in Iraq and what exactly the connection was between them and their mutant pursuer. We find out that Malone and Needle (not specifying the involvement of any of the other five men) served as mercenaries five years ago in Iraq. Hired by Iraqi militants, the group attacked and seized an American Embassy. While there, Malone took a liking to one of the female hostages - a nun. After having his advances rejected countless times, Malone decided that it would be a good idea to then take the nun and other hostages outside, line them up against the wall, and fire unloaded weapons at them from time to time - making them believe they were being executed. This caused the nun to eventually give into his desires.\nOn the thirteenth day, Delta Force attacked the Embassy and killed most of the mercenary soldiers. Malone escaped by killing one of the Delta Force commandos and taking his uniform. As Malone ran down a hall to the exit, an Iraqi soldier - not recognizing him - and was about to shoot him when suddenly he was killed. When Malone went to check out the body he found the Iraqi's throat slit from ear to ear. It's on remembering this that Malone makes the connection that Wolverine must have been there in Iraq.\nMalone, Needle, and Bruno the come to a river where they stumble upon two men preparing to board a canoe. At gunpoint, the three hijack the canoe and set off down the river to supposed safety. Suddenly a hand comes out of the water ahead of them and as they draw closer the hand shoots out its claws and tears the canoe in half right down the middle. As they try and swim to shore Needle is pulled under the water and killed, but Malone and Bruno make it to shore.\nExhausted from being constantly chased, Bruno finally snaps and yells into the woods that he's willing to kill Malone right now if Wolverine lets him live. Before Bruno can shoot him though, Malone pulls out his pistol and kills his last companion. Alone, Malone runs as fast as he can for what seems like hours before he comes to a stop at a waterfall. With nowhere to go but down, Malone is finally cornered by Wolverine who suddenly appears behind him. Now, Wolverine finally explains why he's been chasing Malone.\nFive years ago in Iraq Wolverine was in fact there. Supposedly, within the American Embassy there were Canadian nationals present so prior to Delta Force's entry the Canadian government was contacted. In turn, Wolverine was sent along with the commandos. During the raid Wolverine came across the nun, a Canadian civilian, now a broken and violated being. Catching a stray bullet in the cross-fire the nun's last words were to make the man who violated her so suffer as much as she had. The last two words she heard before dying were Wolverine saying: \"I promise\". Wolverine had every intention of keeping the promise and now five years later he's found Malone.\nDefiant till the end, Malone refuses to die at the hands of Wolverine and instead puts the barrel of his gun to his head and shoots himself - falling down the waterfall into the abyss below. Satisfied with keeping his promise, Wolverine then leaves the scene. As the issue closes we come back to Madripoor where Wolverine sits at, what we can assume is, the Princess Bar holding a cross in his hand.\nFeatured Characters:\nPinup art on back cover."

Tammuz befriendedShalim, the son of the village elderAdad, and the two conspired to run away together - feeling Adad had lost his mind and was leading their people to ruination during a prolonged period of drought and famine.\nWhen Adad discovered their plot, he captured Tammuz and took him to the edge of a bone-strewn crater where a meteorite they called the Good Green Eye had landed. Adad explained to Tammuz that once their land had been bountiful - a gift from their patron deity, the Mother Goddess - but that they had taken too much without giving anything in return. Angered, the Mother Goddess had cast down her eye, which had blighted the land with itsgreen glow. Adad then revealed the reason why he brought Tammuz to the crater: to use him as a human sacrifice to help their tribe survive. Despite Tammuz's protests, Adad kicked him into the crater where the meteorite ripped his body apart as it sucked him into itself through what he saw as agreen gateway.\nTammuz later returned to life, transformed into a hulking humanoid monster with horns and green skin. Sensing underground streams with clean water his people could use to weather the drought, Tammuz realized that the Green Eye's power could be harnessed to provide his people with new technologies. Deciding to postpone leaving with Shalim in favor of using his new knowledge and powers to lead not only his people but the surrounding tribes as well into an age of prosperity, Tammuz set out to return to his village. However, he was attacked by his fellow villagers, caught in a net, and stabbed by spears. Tammuz realized that his fellow villages didn't recognize him and tried speaking to them, but his words came out as gibberish. Tammuz was eventually killed by an arrow fired by Shalim, who realized too late that the monster was Tammuz upon spotting recognized a unique birthmark Tammuz possessed.\nAfter dying, Tammuz's spirit was transported to abarren wastelandand greeted by a being made of green vapor that called itself theOne Below All. As it stated that its sole purpose was destruction, Tammuz - bitter and angry over being betrayed by his fellow villagers - told the One Below All that he wanted to destroy things as well. As the One Below All stated its weapon was hate, Tammuz agreed and the One Below All opened a Green Door for him.\nLater that evening, Tammuz's fellow villagers consumed his flesh. Adad lied that Tammuz had willingly sacrificed himself to the Good Green Eye, and that they could not only survive but prosper in their barren land if they sacrificed the surrounding tribes to the Eye. Tammuz came back to life and began reconstituting his body, causing his fellow villagers to be ripped apart as the flesh they had consumed burst out of their stomachs and mouths; leaving Shalim the only survivor as he had refused to eat Tammuz's flesh. As Tammuz finished regenerating, Shalim tried to explain to Tammuz that he didn't know he was the monster when the villagers killed him. Tammuz briefly considered letting go of his rage, sparing Shalim, and sharing his new knowledge with the surrounding tribes, but was compelled by the One Below All's hatred to kill Shalim and leave his home village alone.[1]\nTammuz, under the name of Enkidu, became friends withGilgamesh, King ofUruk, after meeting and fighting him. The duo killed many creatures in the adventures they had together, including evilgiantsandhuge bulls.[5]When Enkidu died in battle against theEldest,[3]Gilgamesh contemplated mortality, as he was somehow unaware of his ownEternalnature at the time.[5]"

Later,Ikariscame to guide them to a mountain top, where the ark could embark to restart society.[5][4]Other tales involved an ark full of animals, includingNoah'sArk,[6][7]and the Ark ofZothudra, mentioned byHyborian AgewarriorRed SonjaofHyrkania.[8]\nAt some point, Utunaa came to believe that the Second Principle that compels the Eternals to protect theMachineshould be broadly interpreted in a way that includes prioritizinghumanwelfare over Eternal welfare. Two other Eternals who shared this belief wereDumuzaandIshta. All three may have been inspired by the Eternal known only as theForgotten One,[9]\nLess than 10,000 years ago, Utunaa, Dumuza and Ishta joined the Forgotten One to form the group known as theForgotten. Aside from protecting humans from threats, these human-centric radicals have also taken it upon themselves to act as a deterrent to Eternal abuse of humanity. All four have removed themselves from theUni-Mind,[9]in part because of their rejection of Eternal society, but also because they know that, if they were to ever participate in a Uni-Mind, the other Eternals would take the opportunity to mindwipe them.[10]\nRecently, when theResurrection Machineswere damaged by an unknown party,Sersi,Ikaris,ThenaandKingo Sunensuspected that the Forgotten One might be responsible because he had sabotaged those systems once before. Accordingly, they set a trap by provoking the Forgotten One into attacking Sersi at a location inNew York City. Once he had shown himself, Ikaris grabbed him and quickly flew him to a deserted area a safe distance away from the city where Thena and Kingo Sunen ambushed him and chained him up. After Sersi had joined them, the four Eternals talked with their captive and concluded that he was not responsible. At that point, the Forgotten One pointed out that, while he had fallen into their trap, they had also fallen into a trap. At that moment, the Forgotten One's captors noticed that three of them had been painted by red dots from laser sights aimed at them by Utunaa and the other two Forgotten from the nearby woods where they could be seen, partially hidden by stealth suits, targeting the captors with weapons that the Forgotten One claimed could really ruin their day. The Forgotten One then demanded to be freed or the others would open fire but, before any drastic action could be taken, the Forgotten One decided to cooperate in order to prove his innocence. The group of five then used the Machine's transit system to teleport to theIsolation, leaving the three other Forgotten behind so that they could kill the four if they double-crossed the Forgotten One.[9]"

He thinks about how the Greek gods called on him to fight Hades. They never let him back on Olympus after that because he was not honorable in his warfare and he just got the job done. Ares is then seen waiting on a parent-teacher conference about his son, Alex. They talk about how aggressive he is. Alex and Ares go home and talk a little. The next day, Ares brings Alex to school and goes to his job as a carpenter. Hermes turns up, riding a skateboard. It takes Ares a while to notice who he is. Hermes tells Ares he is needed back at Olympus to fight its enemies again. Ares refuses, and starts shooting nails at Hermes, who falls from his position standing on some scaffolding. Ares catches him and tells him to go back to Olympus and tell them he doesn't want war. Then, the whole scaffolding collapses with a huge gust of wind as Hermes disappears. Ares goes back home, only to hear by phone that Alex has gone missing. He goes to school, and yells at the police that they had better find him, and goes back home. He tells himself that its impossible to hide from his job, and opens a secret closet full of weapons. Some police officers arrive at his door, for some reason wanting Alex's social security number. Ares bashes down the door, done with shaving his beard and hair, and looking a lot more like the old Ares (albeit with more modern weapons), says \"I'm going to get my boy... so you better stay the h*** out of my way!\""

He terrorized humankind from the first moments of its history, spreading his cursed blood all over the world. According to legend, he was born around the 5th or 4th millennium BCE in the \"cradle of civilization\" of ancientSumer, Mesopotamia. He was worshipped by theBabyloniansas \"Dagon\", and as the centuries passed, he eventually became known as \"Dracula\". Dracula later became disgusted with the world and retreated to a tomb inIraqto sleep through the coming ages.\nFrom the 16th century onwards, the myths regarding Dracula filtered through Western culture, leadingBram Stokerto write the famous novel bearing his name in 1897. In the 20th century, the mythical version ofDraculaentered popular culture in the form of various motion pictures and comic books.\nSearching for help in their fight with the vampire hunterBlade,Danica TalosandAsher Talosfound Drake's 4,000-year-old tomb in the Syrian Desert, and awakened him. After consuming dozens of humans in order to regain his strength and powers, Drake was informed by Danica on the situation of the vampire kind and onBlade, and, disgusted by their weakness, accepted to hunt down and kill the Daywalker.\nDrake, immune to the effects of sunlight, exited from Talos's base and saw all the changes the world had gone through in the millennia he was asleep. Mocked and accidentally humiliated by two shop owners, who tried to sell him a Dracula-shaped vibrator, Drake killed them both, and then headed forEdgar Vance's office. Once there, Drake killed the familiar and waited for Blade's arrival with the shape of the psychiatrist. Blade arrived along withAbigail WhistlerandHannibal King. After discovering Vance's corpse, the trio attacked Drake, but he easily incapacitated King. While Abigail took care of Hannibal, Blade followed Drake who was escaping on the rooftops. Drake told Blade he felt affinity with him, since they're both \"honorable warriors\", and challenged him to a regular duel. After making a distraction with a baby he held hostage, Drake fled.\nSome days later, when Blade and Abigail were out on hunt, Drake arrived at the Nightstalkers base with the shape of Abraham Whistler. In here, he killed all the Nightstalkers, with the sole exceptions of Hannibal King, who was taken to Danica for an interrogation, andZoe, Sommerfield's little daughter, who Drake wanted to convert to a vampire. When Blade arrived at Talos' place, Drake was awaiting him. The two engaged in a sword fight, during which they proved to be equal. Enjoying the fight, Drake assumed his real shape, a towering demon whose powers were far superior to Blade's. Just a moment before he finished Blade, Abigail tried to kill Drake with an arrow charged with theDaystar Virus, a biological weapon created to kill all vampires once mixed with Drake's blood. Drake's reflexes were too sharp, and he grabed the arrow in mid air, roaring at the girl and leaving it falling on the ground. Blade understood the opportunity, grabed the arrow and stabed Drake's flank with it, releasing the Daystar which killed all nearby vampires. Before death, Drake praised his enemy for his skills and honor, telling him that, as long as Blade was alive, there was future for the vampire race. He then granted Blade a \"parting gift\".\nDrake shared common superhuman abilities with the the rest of the Vampire race, but, being the progenitor, is more powerful. He was born perfect and had no need to evolve."

Fury#1(March, 1963)\nSam Sawyer, aU.S. Armycaptain, recruited selectU.S. Army Rangersto his \"Able\" Company. Sawyer assignedNick Furythe command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the \"Howling Commandos.\"[1]\nThe Howling Commandos, as well as their great rivals, the Second Attack Squad (the \"Maulers\", led bySgt. \"Bull\" McGiveney, with Cpl.Ricketts Johnson), and, later,Jim Morita's Nisei squad were stationed at a military base inEnglandto fight specialized missions. These missions were located primarily, but not exclusively, in the European Theatre ofWorld War II, eventually going as far afield as the Pacific Theatre,Africa, and, once each, in theMiddle Eastand on the Russian front.\nThe Howling Commandos' earliest assignment occurred in the autumn of 1942. They were to recover British rocket scientist Dr. MacMillan from a German military base in occupiedNorway. Their success brought the attention of British Prime MinisterWinston Churchill, who incorporated the unit into the British Army, and given the title of \"Commandos.\"\nAfter further training, the unit was dispatched back behind enemy lines in France to recover a Free French resistance fighter who was captured by Nazi soldiers. This was a vital rescue mission since they knew the date and time of an impending Allied landing on the beaches of Normandy. With the help of Free French resistance fighters they rescued the man from the Nazis before he could be forced to talk.[1]\nAfter seeing combat in a French coastal town, Fury was called back to base where he was informed that the Nazis were getting ahead in the race to develop an atomic bomb. Posing as sailors the Howling Commandos managed to smuggle their way into Germany to seek out the laboratory in the town of Heinemund where the atomic weapons were being developed. Initially captured, they broke free and realized the only way they could get near the lab was to allow themselves to be captured and placed into a nearby concentration camp. Breaking free, Fury and his Commandos attacked the Germany laboratory, sabotaging the scientists works there. After they fled the exposed rods of nuclear material reached critical mass and destroyed the lab in a massive nuclear explosion. It is possible that this setback is what caused Nazi leaderAdolf Hitlerto call off any further development of atomic weapons.[2]\nThe Howlers fought against the likes of German GeneralErwin Rommel[3]and inter-squad bigotry.[3]Antagonists includedBaron Strucker,[4][5]Captain America's nemesesBaron Zemo,[6]as well Adolf Hitler's protégé, theRed Skull, and other Axis villains. The Howlers were some of the first soldiers to see Captain America in action overseas when the Captain helped them to destroy a Nazi rocket research lab. They worked together so well, in fact, that the Howlers were next ordered to accompany Captain America toWakandato discover why a Nazi invasion force had been sent there[7]. The Howlers continued to encounter and fight alongside Captain America andBuckyseveral times throughout the war.[8]\nDespite being an elite squadron, they were in constant conflict with regulations due to Fury's unorthodox command style as well as their constant rivalry with McGiveney's Maulers, which caused the squad members to be thrown into the brig on many occasions.[9][10]\nThey reunited for missions in the Korean War, where Fury received a field promotion to lieutenant, and the Vietnam War, as well as at a present-day reunion gala. Several members of the Howling Commandos have also gone on to spend various amounts of time as a member of Nick Fury's current organizationS.H.I.E.L.D.[11][12]\nThe Howling Commandos later became a Delta Force C Squadron F-Team black-ops unit known for always getting the job done no matter the circumstances or consequences. InCebu City, a mission went bad resulting in the death of a member codenamedBuzzkill.[13]\nInLos Angeles, the Commandos were ordered to go after thePunisher.[14]The Commandos used the Punisher's contact,Sgt. Thomas Tuggs, as bait and eventually tracked him down to his subway hideout. The Punisher almost got away, but a tracking bullet struck him in the torso, wounding him severely.[15]\nThe Commandos then proceeded to use the Punisher's remaining family members as bait.[16]The bait worked,[17]and Punisher was captured by the Commandos;[18]however, the Punisher convinced their leader,Sidewinder, to free him and stop following orders so that he could get to the bottom ofwhosupplied theDos Soles Cartelwith U.S. Army munitions.[19]"

In the present, Captain Marvel attacked his fellow Skrulls before Agent Sante pointed a gun at him and declared that he was a Skrull impostor and not the real Mar-Vell. Captain Marvel offered to let Agent Sante kill him, but also claimed that they could  make the world a better place together. In New York City, Iron Man and Ms. Marvel contemplated what they did to Captain Marvel.\nTwo months later, after Mar-Vell's declaration to end all wars, there was peace in Iraq, Darfur, and Somalia and at the church, Nathan Jefferson told how he saved his life and brought up Tony Stark's claim that Captain Marvel was a time traveler from the past before a Skrull church member's eyes started glowing.

By 1947 he was captured by the authorities and was to be executed for his crimes. However, the Sultan of Baghdad's daughter was to be married, but nothing her father could obtain as wedding gifts could please her. Instead he offered the Thief an ultimatum: steal unique and expensive items for his daughter's wedding and have his sentence commuted, or die. The Thief took up the offer, and was given a list to find the following items: Something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\nThe Thief decided to try his luck in America and took a ship out to the United States. There he successfully stole an priceless Ming vase, the theft making newspaper headlines. He next stole a new chinchilla fur coat from a fashion show. The show was attended by theHuman TorchandTorowho attempted to stop the Thief, however they Thief managed to escape, but not without accidentally dropping his list, tipping the Torch and Toro off to his plans.\nWhen the Thief read about the Gala International Ball, where the wife to the ambassador of Moldavia was going to wear a necklace borrowed from Queen Catherine he hired a gang of thugs to help him with the threat. At the ball, the Thief turned out the lights and stole the necklace, but once more was pursued by the Human Torch and Toro.

She is known for being a fierce warrior and for having amorous relationships with a great multitude of men over the centuries.\nThena's most consistent recurring relationship is a forbidden one with the warlord known asKro, who is a member of the Eternals' arch-enemy race, theDeviants. Thena held the highest title of Prime Eternal for a time, but later stepped down from this position to give it over toIkaris.\nThena, like everyEternal, was created by theCelestialsone million years ago and has looked after humanity ever since.[9][8]\nInitially going by the nameAzura, she encountered theDeviantknown asKroaround 100,000 years ago and and the two began a relationship which was frowned on by her people, forcing them to end things.[10]\nLater on, the EternalSersiconfronted Azura after she took another Deviant lover, but she claimedTzaigowas different, as he was a man of science. With no option but to tell her the truth, Sersi led Azura down a cave, where they found a pool of blood and bodies. There, Tzaigo had been replacing his own organs withprimitive-humanandNeanderthalorgans to extend his life, and was studying Thena to try and improve the process. After being discovered, he tried to attack Thena, but she reacted promptly and killed her lover. In the aftermath, she claimed she would never have a relationship with a Deviant again, but this would prove to be a lie.[10]\nCirca 500 BC, Thena re-encountered Kro in the ancient city ofBabylonand the two rekindled their relationship, but once again they knew it couldn't last.[11]\nIn ancient antiquity, Azura and her fatherZurasmet withAthenaand her fatherZeus. Noticing the marked physical resemblance between them, Athena suggested that the Olympian gods and the Eternals form an alliance in which the Eternals would act as the gods' representatives on Earth. Azura then took the nameThenaas a token of this agreement.[12]\nSince the pact, Thena has often been mistaken for Athena, and the city ofAthenswas apparently built in her honor and not the real goddess.[13]\nIn the 1940's, during the early part ofWorld War II, Azura operated under the Roman goddess identity of \"Minerva\" and persuaded her father \"Jupiter\" (Zuras) to send \"Mercury\" (Makkari) to stop \"Pluto\" (Kro), who had assumed the guise of thePrusslanddictator \"Rudolph Hendler\". While the dictator was sparking war acrossEurope, Mercury successfully thwarted these plans.[1]\nA couple decades later, Thena and Kro met once again and made love during a war in Southeast Asia,[note 1]resulting in Thena becoming pregnant with his twin heirs. Given their mixed ancestry, Thena placed their embryos inside of one Ms. Ritter, an infertile woman, who raised them as her own twin children,Donald and Deborah.[11]\nWhen Kro led his armies in an attack onNew Yorkafter the arrival of the Fourth Host ofCelestials, Thena opposed him.[14]\nAfter Kro called a truce, she decided to reveal their races' existence to humanity via ProfessorSamuel Holden, Kro also revealed to her Deviant citizen,Ransak the Reject, a genetically stable Deviant.[15]\nThena as Corona of the New Breed\nWith the revelation of Ransak and Kro'swillingnessfor peace, Thena was convinced by the DeviantKarkasto grant both of them sanctuary. After Zuras' death and the subsequent departure of most of theEternalsfrom Earth, Thena became Prime Eternal. Yet, her being traumatized by her father's death allowed her to be subtly influenced by a Brain-Mine Kro had placed upon her. She turned againstIkaristo help save Kro's life, but later had to relinquish her title to Ikaris. When she learned of the Brain-Mine, she was furious with Kro, but had forgiven him after a while.[6][verification needed]\nLike Sersi and Makkari, Thena was affected bySprite's reality-warping to have no memory of her past as an Eternal. Thena was married toThomas Eliot, with a son namedJoey, and was employed as a researcher atStark Enterprises.[16]\nEventually, the Eternals saw through Sprite's illusion, but Thena had grown too close to Joey and didn't want to let him go. She had a heated argument with Zuras over keeping her son due to his being born a mortal, to which the outcome came in her favor as she swore to continue loving and parenting Joey until his death by old age.[17]\nWhen the countless bodies of Celestials rained down on the Earth to herald the arrival of theDark Celestials, the Eternals were made to learn a dark truth that drove them mad: that the true purpose of their kind was to cultivate humankind.\nSince theFirst Hostof Celestials, the Space-Gods allowed humanity to thrive because they saw in their genetic makeup the potential to act as antibodies against theHorde. In their madness and frustration at learning their true purpose, the Eternals either turned against each other or committed suicide, including Thena.[18]\nAfter the mass suicidal, they were all reborn at theExclusion, including Thena, who was cured of her madness.[8]\nHowever, the Mad TitanThanoswas also resurrected by a traitor among the Eternals, even though he was supposed to be. He began killing Eternals, starting with Zuras, and sabotaging the machines of resurrection at the Exclusion, threatening the Earth's biosphere. Thena was interrogated by Sersi about Zuras' death because she had a motive: Thena was consorting with Deviants, which Zuras didn't approve of. In the end, Sersi couldn't determine if Thena was innocent or guilty. So, Thena joined in the investigation and traveled toPolariawithKingo Sunento question its new headDruig, after many of its leaders were killed by Thanos. When Thanos arrived, Thena and Kingo briefly fought him. After Thanos retreated, Thena and Kingo believed that Druig was innocent and focused their attention on Gilgamesh.[19]\nAfter Sersi lured out Gilgamesh and Ikaris battled him, Thena and Kingo restrained Gilgamesh with manacles. Gilgamesh was given to chance to prove his innocence, and when he did, it was revealed that the traitor was Phastos. As Thena and her fellow Eternals went to confront Phastos, Thanos was prepared to ambush them.[20]\nThena and her fellow Eternals were able to overwhelm Thanos, but then Phastos accidentally teleported her and the others all over Earth while trying to teleport them to the Exclusion to help him fix the resurrection machine he broke. Ikaris gave his life to use his matter manipulation power to repair the machine. Thena and the others later learned the reason for Phastos' actions: Eternals were resurrected at the cost of human lives and that the resurrection machines couldn't be turned off without endangering Earth.\nEarth-Eternal Physiology:Thena is an Eternal, who is capable of manipulating cosmic energy for a variety of purposes. As well as possessing skills that were learned over the course of millennia of living."

The Cold War era occurred onEarth-616much in the same way as in the real world. Below details events that are unique to that universe.\nA man who wanted to be asCaptain Americawas surgically altered to look identical to Steve Rogers. He fought communists during the early 1950's, including a communist Red Skull. He was finally frozen by the scientists.\nIn many other countries, the communist influence began civil wars and revolutions. The year 1955 saw the starts of both theKoreanandVietnam Wars.\nTheEarth-616universe operates on aSliding Timescale, meaning that events in that universe happen much slower than in real time. As a result, events that were first published in the 1960s get \"pushed forward\" in time. Events published byMarvel Comicsin the 1960s are said to have occurred roughly \"ten years ago\" in relative comparison to the current point in history. As such while a lot of early Marvel stories have events heavily influenced by the Cold War are considered \"topical references\" in relation to the date in which the story was published. Recent editions of theOfficial Handbook of the Marvel Universeusually generalizes specific events that are considered topical for the time in which the story was published.\nFor example, as perFantastic Four#1, the historic rocket trip from which theFantastic Fourgained their powers was a result of the space race. However, byFantastic Four#236all references to Reed's \"rocket trip\" had been retconned as the space race had become a date references. In addition Reed's spacecraft is no longer referred to as a rocket and his purposes for going into space have since vastly expanded to be considered more fantastic, and less dated.\nOther examples still maintain at least part of the original story telling. For example, in theIncredible Hulk#1, a Russian spy namedIgor Drenkovwas sent to America to steal weapons, aircraft and national secrets. Igor actions led to the accidental creation of theHulk.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z#5(published in 2008) still references Igor as a Russian spy, however it is generally accepted that any Cold War references in that story are considered topical.\nTales of Suspense#39, which features the birth ofIron Manwas originally set inVietnam, during America's involvement in theVietnam War. However sinceIron Man(Vol. 4) #1(published in 2005) retconned Iron Man's origins so that his injury occurred while in Afghanistan and excised all references to the Cold War."

Upon hearing of this, Cleopatra committed suicide by allowing herself to be bitten by a poisonous asp.[23]\nIn 1 BC, Augustus decreed that a census be taken, and every person in the entire Roman Empire had to go to his own town to register.

Danica taunted him, loving the position of power however her fun was interrupted…by Hannibal King. She was livid that the Nightstalkers had taken Blade from them and killed a number of their ranks.\nThey kidnap Hannibal King andZoe Sommerfield. Danica then starts to torture Hannibal, but her fun was interrupted as Abigail and Blade show up to rescue him and set off the Daystar virus. Danica ran out but when Hannibal freed him from a fight with Jarko and tried to help Abigail, whilst Blade fought Dracula (Drake), she fought with him and at least to start with.\nAll vampires share common superhuman attributes; regardless of whether they were born a vampire or were once human and were subsequently turned into a vampire.

Its success allowed the concept to grow and expand, becoming the larger operation known asWeapon Plus.[5]\nThe project working onSteve Rogers,Captain America.\nIn February 1941,Naziscientists;Dr. Abraham Erskine,Professor Hans BruderandProfessor Eric Schmittworked forProject Nietzsche. They hoped to create the first \"Ubermensch\" Dr. Erskine however defected to theUnited States of America.[6]\nNow in the US the project began as a collaboration betweenAmericanandBritishgovernments. He was given the code name of \"Joseph Reinstein\"[7]and became the primary source of the American program. Dr. Erskine independently created both the chemical portion of the project, theSuper-Soldier Serum, that has been recreated to certain degrees, as well as theVita Rayhoused in theVita-Ray Chambertreatment that has not been recreated since.\nThe project created two failed subjects:Clinton McIntyre, a.k.a. Protocide, andAdriana Soria, a.k.a. Queen. Protocide was placed in suspended animation and was revived in the modern era byA.I.M.[8]Queen was the firstmutantexperiment. Experimentation on her seems to have occurred prior to the serum being tested on Steve Rogers.[9]\nErskine continued to refine the process and eventually succeeded in being able to convert frailSteven Rogersinto the first Super Soldier. Rogers took the name Captain America. But Erskine was murdered moments after Rogers was successfully empowered. All of the refinements Erskine had made to the program were lost with his death, as he never fully documented all of his research to the recorded notes. What had made the process successful with Rogers, especially theVita-Ray portion, could not be recreated at the time.William Burnside(a.k.a.Steve Rogers II) eventually found and used the chemical portion of this process to become the Captain America of the 1950s.[10]\nWith Erskine's murder,Wilfred Nageltook over the American program under the code name of Josef Reinstein. Nagel's attempt to recreate Erskine's successful process with Rogers, did not succeed in mass production. Nagel's early attempts to recreate Erskine's successful chemical formula resulted in African-American super soldiers (most prominentlyIsaiah Bradley). Three hundred African-American soldiers were taken fromCamp Cathcartand subjected to potentially fatal experiments at an undisclosed location in an attempt to recreate Erskine's successful Super-Soldier Formula. Only five men survived the original trials; hundreds of test subjects left behind at Camp Cathcart and the camp's commander were executed by US soldiers in the name of secrecy. The families of the three hundred were told that they had died in battle.[11]\nWhile Nagel failed to create a working mass-production version of Erskine's formula, Nagel did make relatively successful samples, such as the one that kept thenColonel Walker Priceyounger than his chronological age and still muscular and fit into his 90's.[12]\nAlthough there were many later attempts to recreate or reverse-engineer Operation: Rebirth's Super-Soldier Serum in detail, none are known to have been involved with Weapon Plus, nor have been successful in replicating the missing Vita Ray portion. The exception was an attempt which resulted in the creation of Isaiah Bradley's sonJosiah X. Weapon Plus considers Steven Rogers its most successful creation.[13]\nA second Project Rebirth later began as an offshoot of theSym-Soldier Program, a super-soldier operation using capturedSymbiotesto create super-soldiers.[14]After capturing theVenom symbiote, Project Rebirth 2.0 attempted to bond it to military hosts to create \"Agent Venom\" - killingCal Henriksenafter he lost control before succeeding withCorporal Flash Thompson, who was initially signed up for 20 missions.[15][16]Project Rebirth 2.0 came into conflict withCrime Master's syndicate and was raided by theSpider-Queen's horde during theSpider-Islandincident.[17]Upon being made aware of Project Rebirth 2.0's existence, Captain America personally shut it down,[18]and its resources were appropriated byWeapon V.[19]"

Burnstein,Jack KirbyFirstRed Raven Comics#1(May, 1940)(As Rudolph Hendler/Pluto)Eternals#1(April, 1976)(As Kro)\nIrises:\nKro[6]is a warlord, dictator,[2]and general to theDeviants;[1]Deviants being an offshoot of theevolutionaryprocess that createdhumanlife onEarthinstigated by theCelestials. They were created to wage war against their counterparts, theEternals.[7]He is more than 100,000 years old[8]and secretly animmortal-shapeshiftercloser to the Eternals then his own kind, forcing him to hide his powers from his people.[9]Over the centuries he has been mistaken to be theOlympianPluto,[2]theDevil,[1]and many other mythological figures. He is the secret lover ofThenaand because of this has sometimes been a reluctant ally of the Eternals.[10]\nKro was born inLemuriato the race ofDeviants, an evolutionary offshoot of humanity, cursed with an unstable genetic code causing random physical characteristics to crop up in each newborn child in the race. Kro was born with a number of traits which appeared to be unique among the Deviant race and which were beneficial in nature. Chief among these mutations were those granting Kro his longevity and near-indestructibility, both similar to those of another evolutionary offshoot of humanity, theEternals.[citation needed]\nKro was alive around 20,000 years ago at the time that the Second Host of the extraterrestrialCelestialsdestroyed the Deviant Empire in theGreat Cataclysm.[11][12]\nKro carefully guarded the secret of his longevity by assuming a series of different identities among the Deviants over the course of his extraordinarily long life, using his powers to alter his facial features to complete his disguises. Kro feared that if he allowed the other Deviants to know that he was virtually immortal, they would subject him to genetic experimentation in order to learn how to duplicate the mutations that gave him his near-immortality in themselves. Kro studied the arts of warfare throughout his life and often led Deviant armies in his various guises.[citation needed]Across the centuries he was confused for various mythological figures such as the Olympian \"Pluto\",[2]theDevil, andSatan, occasionally growing horns to match these roles.[1]\nInBabylon2,500 years ago, Kro met and fell in love withThena, daughter ofZuras, ruler of the Eternals of Earth. Thena returned Kro's love, but their relationship, perhaps the first such liaison between the two divergent races of humanity which had long been enemies, ended badly. Kro and Thena parted, although they retained strong feelings for each other.[10]Thena assumed that Kro eventually died, and was surprised when she encountered him again in recent years. Kro attempted to renew their relationship, but failed.[citation needed]\nA millennia ago, Kro stole the Power Gems from the Celestials and hid it on an island in thePacific Ocean.[13]\nAs Pluto in 1940's\nKro had many interactions with normal humans, usually sowing chaos wherever he went. Adopting a devilish appearance, he was believed to be Pluto, Satan, and other underworld rulers - Kro did not dissuade these cases of mistaken identities. He was constantly thwarted by the Eternal known asMakkari, first mistaken as the godMercurythen in his assumed identity as Hurricane.\nThe first such clash, Kro assumed the guise ofPrusslanddictator Rudolph Hendler, sparking war acrossEurope. However, Makkari (as Mercury) thwarted this plan by preventing the warring armies from continuing their conflict, eventually lulling them into peace, and forcing Kro to flee.[2]Fleeing to America, and continuing to use his Pluto guise, Kro attempted to destabilize whatever human society whenever possible.\nAssuming the alias Paul Sayden, Kro setup operations inCoast City, facilitating the criminal activities ofPiggy Perroni. This operation was foiled by Makkari (operating in his Hurricane identity), and Pluto ultimately fled after losing a battle against Hurricane at a costumed party.[4]Relocating to the Mato Grosso region ofBrazil, Kro unleashed the deadly \"Green Plague\" in the region. He then allied himself withJivaro headhunters, convincing them to kill anyone who attempted to cure the disease. This plot was also foiled by Hurricane, although Kro was long gone by the time a cure for the disease was discovered.[14]\nIn his last recorded appearance while operating as Pluto, Kro returned to America, setting up in Groton City under the alias \"Mr. S Devile\". There he hired mobsterScarface Rispoliand had him place \"Death Boxes\" in subways to cause fatal accidents that would slaughter all passengers aboard. This plot was once again foiled by Hurricane who captured Rispoli and prevented Kro from planting yet another Death Box. Overpowering Kro in battle, Hurricane sent him fleeing into the sky.[5]\nIn the 1950s, he oversaw the unleashing of Deviant mutates such asTricephalous,Giganto,Gigantus, and others fromMonster Isle, nearJapan.[15]\nIn the early 1970s, Kro and Thena met again during theVietnam War. Their reunion resulted in Thena becoming pregnant with twins. She used advanced Eternal technology to transplant them into the womb of an infertile human woman named Mrs. Ritter who gave birth to them and raised them as her own twin children,Donald and Deborah.[10]\nWhen the fourth Host of the Celestials was approaching Earth, Kro was ordered byBrother Tode, the monarch of the Deviants, to find and disable the Celestials' cosmic beacon.[7]After he failed, he was tortured by Tode. To save himself, Kro proposed taking the form of the humans' devil and attackingNew York Cityin order to trick the humans into attacking the Celestials.[16]He managed to captureIkaris, who was defending the city, and entombed him in a capsule at the bottom of the ocean,[17]along withSersiandMargo Damian.[18]Convinced that humanity would be driven to aggression against the Celestials, he agreed to a truce with Thena and allowed the existence of the two races to be revealed to ProfessorSamuel Holdenand his students.[19]\nAfter the demise of Zuras, Brother Tode led an assault onOlympia, the principal city of the Eternals, where the Deviants captured and imprisoned all the Eternals. Almost the entire Deviant ruling elite, including Warlord Kro, accompanied Tode and Deviant troops on this venture. Thanks to the intervention ofJames Rhodesas Iron Man, the Eternals regained their freedom and captured the Deviants that were on Olympia. The Eternals decided to transform all of the captured Deviants into a large block of atoms and send the block into outer space. Before the Eternals carried out this plan, Thena secretly released Kro from his cell, and Kro escaped. Shortly thereafter, most of Earth's Eternals left for outer space. Thena became the ruler of the Eternals left on Earth.[20]\nKro made his way back to the Deviants' city in underseaLemuria, intent on making himself their monarch now that virtually the entire Deviant ruling class was no more. To his astonishment Kro discovered that the Deviant priesthood, headed by the priest lordGhaur, was manoeuvring to become the true ruling power in Deviant Lemuria. Since one of the priesthood's roles was to designate the new monarch, Kro confronted Ghaur and made his wish to become king clear. Ghaur allowed Kro to become monarch, but continued to pursue his plans. He had Kro lead an expedition to the Pyramid of the Winds, an Eternal structure in theArctic, to retrieve a mysterious vial. Ghaur apparently hoped that Kro would be killed by the Eternals in the course of this venture. Once Kro found the vial, a Deviant priest and his guards demanded he give it to them, but Kro, determined to maintain his authority as ruler, refused. A party of Eternals led by Ikaris arrived, and Ikaris fought Kro for the vial. Thena, still in love with Kro, prevented Ikaris from killing him, and, on Kro's request, teleported Kro away. The Deviant priest's guards had managed to get hold of the vial for their masters. Kro and Thena traveled together as renegades, each hunted by his or her own race. They were finally found by Ikaris, who let them go after he replaced Thena as Prime Eternal. However, Ghaur still sought to capture Kro.[21]\nKro watchedQuasarbattleTutinaxwhen trying to saveRansak the Reject. Tutinax quickly took the upper hand as images of Quasar's father took the place of Tutinax, distracting Quasar, but was later beaten by Ransak.[22]\nKro learned ofDonald and Deborah's existence after a mutatedAjakbegan murdering twins across the US. Controlled by a vengefulDr. Daniel Damian, the Ajak monster was searching for the \"Chosen Ones,\" knowing their origin as Eternal-Deviant hybrids. Thena brought them to Olympia for their safety but the mutated Ajak pursued them there and captured them, then brought them Damian inPeru. Once the threat posed by Damien had been ended, Thena told the twins their origins and then took them to meet their father.[10]\nKro later formed theDelta ForceDeviants to help fellow Deviants. When the injured EternalSersifell into Kro'ssubterraneanhideout beneath thePentagonand asked for assistance in rescuing theAvengers, Kro facilitated his Delta Network to gather the right Deviants for the rescue operation.[23]When Maelstrom began attacking the Eternals, Kro took his human children away into hiding to protect them from the threat.[24]...[25]While away with Delta Force, Kro and Ghaur divide grew causing factions the external world became concerned about and Wakanda came to the city to intervene. Kro continued on as the formal monarch.[26]\nDespite his Deviant heritage, Kro possesses a number of superhuman traits characteristic of an Eternal:"

GoyerFirstBlade(August 21, 1998)\nVanessa Brooks(mother, deceased)\nOther Relatives:\nIrises:\nBlade is a half-vampire \"Daywalker\" who hunts vampires. \nEric Brooks (Blade) is the son of Robert andVanessa Brooks. Vanessa Brooks, a nurse, was attacked and bitten by a vampire (Deacon Frost) while in pregnancy. Eric Brooks was born while his mother was dying, inheriting some of the traits of vampires. Young Eric Brooks lived most of his life on the streets; until the day he was attacked by Abraham Whistler, a vampire hunter who mistook him for a pure-blooded vampire, but when he came to understand the nature of the child, took him in and trained him to become a vampire hunter.\nBlade was hunting Deacon Frost, a young powerful vampire, and was destroying his vampire night clubs. During an attack on one of the clubs, Blade badly wounded Quinn, one of Frost's retainers. He was interrupted by the police and did not finish the vampire, opting instead to track him. Having tracked the vampire to the hospital, Blade found that Quinn had already bitten the two doctors who were examining the creature. SeeingDr. Karen Jenson, and seeing a resemblance to his mother, he refrained from destroying her and took her with him instead.\nBlade decided to use Jenson as a bait for Frost and let her go back home. There she was attacked by one of Frost's familiars, a police officer. Blade intervened and beat him hard, just to follow him again to the hideout of a vampire archivist named Pearl. Blade and Karen interrogated him, and found out Frost's plans regardingLa Magra, a legendary vampire \"blood god\". The two were then attacked by Quinn and Mercury, but managed to escape thanks to Whistler's arrival.\nBlade was out to get some serum from one of his allies but, when he comes back to his base, found out that Karen had been kidnapped by Frost, and that Whistler had been bitten. Blade couldn't shoot his mentor and so gave him the gun, letting him commit suicide. Enraged, Blade attacked Frost's mansion, with the new weapon granted by Karen, the EDTA, an anticoagulant which proved to be lethal to vampires. In there, Blade found his mother, now a vampire, and that she had become one of Frost's lovers. Shocked, he was easily captured by Frost's men and taken to La Magra temple. Blade was placed in a special sarcophagus for his blood to be drained and used for freeing La Magra. Exhausted, Blade was saved by Dr. Karen Jenson, who managed to free herself. The woman let Blade bite her to regain his strength, just in time to kill his mother.\nWith Blade at full strength, he killed most of Frost's minions, Quinn included. Eventually, he confronted Frost, who had become a vessel of La Magra. With his sword proving to be useless on the blood god, Blade attacked him with EDTA, killing him. Finally, Blade and Dr. Karen Jenson exited from the temple and Karen asked Blade if he wants to be cured. The cure would end Blade's thirst for blood, but at the cost of losing his vampire powers. Blade refused, wanting to continue his battle. He was later seen in Russia, pursuing a vampire; he was following the vampires who transformed Whistler and kidnapped him.[1]\nAfter two years of investigations, Blade managed to find the vampires who had held Whistler captive and forced a vampire namedRushto show him where their base was and after killing his companions, he let him go but told him he would see him again. After reuniting and freeing Whistler, he thought at one point of ending his life but did not and took him to his current base to provide him with a cure that would cure him of vampirism even though his companion,Scud, had told him to kill him anyway, before long, the cure took effect and cured him. On that same night, they were ambushed by two messengers who wereNyssa DamaskinosandAsadwho were sent byEli Damaskinosto bring Blade and his companions to him. The three of them meet the old pureblood, he asks them for help against a plague, called the Reaper Virus that is being spread byJared Nomak, an abnormal vampire just like Blade, the infection attacked both humans and vampires who became transmitters of the virus and must be stopped before the infection spreads further.\nBlade was assigned to the Bloodpack team, a squad of elite vampires created to kill Blade himself but due to the current circumstances, Blade intimidated the team who one of them,Reinhardt, reacted to his provocations and tried to attack him but only received a remotely controlled explosive implant in his head.[3]\nSometime later, Blade came across theTime Variance Authoritywho would ultimately prune him and send him to theVoidwhere he would meet several other heroes such asElektra,X-23,Gambit,Human Torch,Daredevil,PunisherandMagnetowho would build the Resistance against the malevolent ruler of the Void,Cassandra Nova.\nThey were able to hide fromAliothin the Borderlands, but remained unable to take down Cassandra who would kill any of them who tried to go against her.[4]\nOne day, Laura brought to their hideoutDeadpoolandWolverinewho were recently deposited to the Void. Deadpool revealed that the two of them have been to Cassandra's lair and were able to escape, and that Cassandra possessed a way out of the Void. A plan was formulated to block her powers by using theJuggernaut's helmet, and the six of them set out for Cassandra's lair inside aHonda Odyssey. Blade usedPunisher's rocket launcher to blast their way inside, where the Resistance was confronted by the army of Cassandra's henchmen. Wolverine and Deadpool went after Nova, while the other four stayed behind to provide cover. During the battle Gambit used hisstaffand playing cards to violently explode many of his enemies. Eventually the plan worked, and Nova used aSling Ringto open a portal leading out of the Void, but only Wolverine and Deadpool managed to make it through because Nova opened it high above the ground. The rest could only stand and watch as the mission was accomplished and their legacy was secured.\nDhampir Physiology:As a result of his mother being bitten by a vampire while giving birth to him, Blade was born with superhuman physical capabilities similar to those of vampires.\nBlade as he appeared inBlade: The Series."

A few days earlier, theVisionhad discovered that a miniaturized part from within his android body had been manufactured there in 1939 and had gone to Timely to investigate the anachronism. Although he had expected to only be gone for a day, nobody has heard from him since then so Cap has come to search for him. Finding the residents to be nice but odd, Cap goes to the only manufacturing plant in town, Timely Industries, and attempts to speak with its manager but upon entering the office Cap suddenly finds himself transported to an unknown location on the banks of a river. Seconds later, he spots three stone men battering a man and jumps in to help. Cap soon recognizes the Stone Men asaliensand when their victim joins the fight, Cap recognizes him as his former Avengers teammate, theEternalGilgamesh. Unable to stand against the two heroes, the aliens flee to their small starship and leave the planet. Although Gilgamesh fails to recognize him and doesn't speak English, it's not until he mentions the name \"Enkidu\" that Cap realizes that he's actually almost 5,000 years in the past. Cap's suspicion that he has become involved in Gilgamesh's legendary quest to obtain immortality is confirmed when Gilgamesh recognizes the name \"Utnapishtim.\" When the boatman Urshanabi arrives, Cap is initially going to let Gilgamesh continue on his quest alone but changes his mind after he spots a futuristic domed city in the distance on the far side of the River of Death.\nMeanwhile, in a Boston suburbs in the 20th century, a meditating Dr. Anthony Druid is approached by a woman he recognizes as his former lover/enemyNebula. She begs for his forgiveness and his help but he refuses to listen.\nBack in 2700 B.C., Cap and Gilgamesh reach the other side of the river and are met byUtnapishtimwho is accompanied by ayoung girl. Although still not understanding their language, Cap remembers what Gilgamesh is going to do and watches him dive into the river to retrieve the Plant of Immortality that grows at the bottom. However, when Cap spots the shadow of a giant serpentine creature approaching Gilgamesh under the water, he dives in to help. Gilgamesh initially leaves Cap to battle the sea monster alone while he recovers the plant but then abandons it to come to Cap's rescue. The heroes drive off the sea serpent but it takes the plant with it. After watching Gilgamesh being ferried back across the river, Cap prepares to resume his journey to the citadel but is approached by the young girl who gives him some faded flowers while mentioning, in the language that Cap doesn't understand, that since Utnapishtim has departed she will not be able to determine if he was an Eternal or just a man. When the flowers suddenly become fresh again, Cap asks the girl who she is and she identifies herself as \"Sersi\" and indicates that she wants to join him. Realizing that the girl is the child version of the Eternal woman he will know in the future, Cap agrees to let her accompany him but suspects that he might never reach the towers that he sees in the distance.\nMeanwhile, within that city,Kangasks a robot if the prisoner has been shown the excellence and might of his newChronopolis. When the robot replies that the prisoner claims to not be impressed, Kang asserts that he is a fool and will soon learn that Kang the Conqueror is the master there.

Initially really angry at someone who would threaten good, honest working people, Sam's anger is defused when a co-worker identifies the young man as Tyrone McQuaid, Sally Mae's boy, someone who Sam had known as being a good kid. Once in Sam's office, Ty explains that he was desperate because he really needs the Falcon to save his life. Ty reveals that about a year earlier, just after his mother died, he accepted a friend's advice to join a training school for gangsters run byTaskmaster. Ty eventually realized that he just wasn't cut out for life as a criminal and left but he knows that Taskmaster doesn't allow runaways and is sure that other students have been sent to kill him. Sam agrees to help and they head for Sam's apartment but before they get there they are intercepted by Dwayne who warns them that three armed, costume-wearing strangers have been looking for him and are on the roof of his apartment building.\nThanks to this warning, Sam takes Ty to his sister Sarah's apartment instead. Knowing that he would be making himself an easy target if he tried to get his Falcon uniform from his apartment while it was under surveillance, Sam calls Desmond Burrell at Stark Enterprises to ask about the new super-threads that he's been building. When Dez tells him that they'll be ready for testing next Friday, Sam says he'll need them by that night. Dez is very reluctant, pointing out how risky it would be to go into action in a suit that hasn't been tested, but Sam is insistent that Dez have a messenger deliver it to the 125th Street Station stop by 7 PM.\nThat night, accompanied by Redwing, the Falcon flies over Harlem in his new flight suit which fortunately seems to be working almost perfectly. The Falcon and Redwing then go into action against the three goons on the rooftop of Sam's building and quickly take them all down but, only seconds later, a lot more goons show up and start attacking. With help from Redwing and his new equipment, Falcon manages to knock all of them out as well but before he can disarm them and tie them up his link with Redwing warns him of another armed threat behind him. Falcon is able to disarm this attacker who turns out to be Taskmaster but Falcon initially pretends to not recognize him. The two battle for a while until three police cars pull up before the building. At that moment, Ty appears on the rooftop, armed with a gun taken from one of the fallen goons, and tries to force Taskmaster to disarm himself. When Taskmaster refuses, Ty fires at him but, protected by his shield, the villain rushes forward and pushes Ty off the rooftop. The Falcon does a power dive after him and manages to catch Ty before he hits the streets but Taskmaster is gone by the time he returns to the roof. Tyrone is unhappy with this outcome, feeling that he's in as much danger as before, but Falcon points out that, with almost a dozen of his pupils in police custody and willing to make plea bargains, he suspects that Taskmaster will be so occupied with avoiding the law that he won't be back to bother Tyrone. Ty doubts this but Falcon tells Tyrone that when he wants to talk about what to do next, he knows where to find him.\nFeatured Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nSeated on his throne in his citadel of Chronopolis,Kang the Conquerorbegins to record his life story for posterity.

According to Private Biljo White, a \"Dr. Anderson\" indicated that potassium was one of the chemicals used in its formulation.[5]RealityEarth-616Lead DesignerDr. Abraham ErskineAdditional DesignersProject RebirthPlace of CreationGermanyCreators and AppearancesCreatorsJoe Simon,Jack KirbyFirstCaptain America Comics#1(December, 1940)\nTheSuper-Soldier Serumis a formula designed to createsuper-soldiers. The name is a misnomer, as the \"serum\" actually consists of various processes. Subjects that are considered to have been enhanced to their \"Peak-Potential\" are noted to beCaptain America,[4]Isaiah Bradley,[6]Josiah X,[7]Protocidevia an SSS variant,[8]andUnion Jackvia a different SSS.[9]Variations of the Super-Soldier Serum have been developed over the years which induced greater-mutations than peak human capabilities.[10][11][12]So far, it would appear that Captain America (Steve Rogers) is the \"perfect man.\"[13]The more powerful variants come with strange side-effects that may also include mental deficiencies.[7]\nJohn Steelewas captured duringWorld War Iand his body was kept in stasis at a lab located inFrankfurt,Germany. In February 1941,Naziscientists;Dr. Abraham ErskineandProfessor Eric Schmittsought to unlock the secrets of Steele's abilities forProject: Nietzsche. The also hoped to useHomo mermanusDNA but the mission to retrieve it failed. Their attempts were met with varying success.[14]\nDr. Erskine, however, defected to theUnited States of Americawith the help ofNick Fury, taking his work with him.[15]In the summer of 1941 his Jewish ancestry was discovered by theRed Skullwho ordered Schmitt to be taken to a concentration camp.[16]\nImprisoned by the Nazis and dying, Schmitt askedBrian Falsworthto keep the sample of the Super-Soldier formula he had concealed on his person from falling into Nazi hands. Falsworth took the disguised flask, drank its contents, and was immediately enhanced by the Super-Soldier formula. Falsworth escaped the prison and became a costumed fighter of Nazis within Germany itself known as the Destroyer.[9]\nMaster Man (Wilhelm Lohmer)was subjected to the Nazi version of the Super-Soldier Serum. Although the formula was a derivative of the original Super-Soldier Serum that gaveCaptain Americahis powers, Lohmer gained abilities exceeding those of Captain America.[17]\nOperation: Rebirth\nIn the states;Dr. Erskinedeveloped the first \"Super-Soldier Serum\" as part of a top-secret US Government experiment calledOperation: Rebirth.[4]He was now code-named \"Professor Reinstein\" to hide his identity.[4]\nThe first and the most successful recipient of the Super-Soldier Serum wasSteve Rogers. Selected byGeneral Chester Phillipsof theU.S. Armyto undergo testing, Rogers was at last administered the Super-Soldier Serum. Given part of the compound intravenously and another part orally, Rogers was then bombarded by \"vita-rays,\" a special combination of exotic (in 1941) wavelengths of radiation designed to accelerate and stabilize the serum's effect on his body.[13]Steve Rogers emerged from theVita-Ray Chamberwith an enhanced body as perfect as a body can be.[18]ANazi spywho observed the experiment murdered Dr. Erskine mere minutes after its conclusion.[4]Erskine died without fully committing the Super-Soldier formula to paper, leaving Steve Rogers the sole beneficiary of his genius.[4]\nSince 1941 more than 500 known attempts have tried to create another super-soldier comparable to Captain America. Fewer than ten subjects are alive.[19]\nAfter losing the secrets of the Super-Soldier Serum with the death of Erskine, the United States Army wanted to produce more super-soldiers like Rogers.Col. Walker PriceandDr. Wilfred Nagelforcibly recruited Isaiah and 300 other African-American soldiers to serve as test subjects to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum. To keep the operation secret, families were sent letters informing them of the soldiers' deaths;[6]however, Faith refused to accept Isaiah's death, and continued to look for the truth.[20]\nThe Black Super Soldiers\nOf the 300 African American soldiers, only a handful of men survived the gruesome process. These survivors became a covert black ops team. After only a few missions, only Isaiah,Maurice CanfieldandSgt. Luke Evansremained.[21]While waiting in Sintra,Portugalfor the arrival of Captain America, Maurice discovered the truth about his parents' death. Enraged by the information, coupled with PTSD and an exaggerated thyroid gland, Maurice was led into a confrontation resulting in his death, the death of Sgt. Evans, and the severe injury of Isaiah andPvt. Merritt.[20]\nThe U.S. military began experiments to duplicate Isaiah's powers. To this end, they harvested blood from Isaiah (before the Super-Soldier Serum made him super durable). Thirty-eight failed attempts occurred beforeJosiahwas finally carried to term.A young African American girlmatching Faith's blood type served as a surrogate mother, but when she discovered the truth about what the child would be used for, she escaped with Josiah.[7]\nBlack Widow OPS program\nThe Soviet Union created a program namedBlack Widow Ops.Natasha Romanoffwas one of the infant females that received a special treatment designed by a biochemistDr. Lyudmila Kudrin. Kudrin created the female version of Super-Soldier Serum to enhance their immune system, lifespan, and physical attributes.[22]\nAn attempt at recreating the Super-Soldier Serum magnifying its effects a thousand times over begun in March of 1947 as part of a joint American/Canadian government operation. The end result was theGolden Sentry Serum, which was ingested by a meth addict namedRobert Reynoldswho broke into a laboratory containing the formula in search for drugs. He consumed the compound intending to get high and obtained remarkable solar-based superhuman abilities. All samples of the serum were destroyed afterwards, and the program was shut down since the project's personnel were terrified of the unprecedented effect of the serum's unauthorized use and the implication that Reynolds could share the power with others.[23]\nIn 1953 the man who would become theGrand Directorflew to Germany, and examined the files of Major Kerfoot, a Nazi espionage officer in the SS. He discovered that the papers contained the original Super-Soldier formula. He revealed his discovery to certain high officials in the US government and made a deal whereby he would become the new Captain America, and act as a symbol during the Korean War. How the original Super-Soldier formula came to be in the possession of the Nazis is unknown, especially as Erskine died without fully committing the Super-Soldier formula to paper.[24][25]\nDr. Noah Bursteincreated theElectro-Biochemical System.[12]It was based on his father's work who was aNaziscientist working on duplicating the Super-Soldier Serum.[26]The Electro Bio-Chemical system was created to stimulate human cell regeneration. He created it to heal any wound, cure any disease and even halt the aging process. The project was funded by a grant fromStark Industries.[12]\nHis first subject was when he worked for theUnited States Armyas a surgeon inVietnamwhere his experiments produced theC.I.A.operativeWarhawk.[27]\nLater looking for test subjects atSeagate Prison, he recruitedCarl Lucasas a volunteer for experimental cell regeneration based on a variant of the Super-Soldier process, he had previously used to empower Warhawk. Dr. Burstein immersed Lucas in an electrical field conducted by an organic chemical compound; when he left Lucas unattended, prison guardAlbert Rackhammisused the experiment's controls, hoping to maim or kill Lucas. Lucas's treatment was accelerated past its intent, inducing body-wide enhancement that gave him superhuman strength and durability.[12]\nBushmasterkidnapped Dr Burstein.[28]Bushmaster forced Burstein to mutate him as he had Cage, but was nonetheless defeated and soon became paralyzed by the process.[29]Bushmaster later died when he was turned into a metal-like substance after his last-ditch effort to find a cure by reversing the process that gave Cage his powers failed, reverting to a permanently-immobilized statue.[30]Cruz McIver, the son of Bushmaster, after he was confident that the process wouldn't kill him like the other subjects, augmented himself using his father, but his plan backfired and only granted more power to his father who, in turn, used that power to kill his own son and also drainIron Fistof his powers. However, the absorption and accumulation of so much power was too great for Bushmaster and he exploded as a result.[31]\nThe Navy was attempting to make its own version of Captain America using the 'AVX' patch (Acetovaxidol). Loosely based off of the process Luke Cage underwent, it was hoped that continued applications of the patch would be a more controllable dosage and keep the subject from going rogue. Unfortunately, the process seemed to aggravateAnti-Cap's mental problems.[32]\nPatriot (Elijah Bradley)leader of theYoung Avengers, was the nephew of Josiah X and grandson of Isaiah Bradley. He claimed that he received ablood transfusionfrom his grandfather gaining the same enhanced abilities. But in truth he was using theMutant Growth Hormone. Soon the truth came out and he quit the team. But he came to the rescue of his friends during the subsequent battle between theKreeand theSkrullforces, the Young Avengers and theNew Avengers, Patriot used himself to shield Captain America from gunfire, and was severely injured. After the battle Captain America rushed to the hospital to give Eli a blood transfusion only to discover \"another Captain America\",Eli's grandfather, had already given Eli his blood. Since the transfusion, Eli has gained physical attributes and powers of a real Super Soldier.[33]\nDr. Jacob Erskine, the grandson ofDr. Abraham Erskine, tried to use the Super-Soldier Serum to curecancer.[34]\nTodd Zillerwas a volunteer in the new Super-Soldier process. They could not recreate the serum, so the Army used existing transformative substances. The final result includedGammaenhancements,Mutant Growth Hormone,Pym Particles, and theConnors Formula. The resulting application of the serum in Ziller's body turned him into a giant reptile similar toGodzilla, for which he was given the alias of \"American Kaiju.\"[35]\nThe most common power granted by the Super-Soldier Serum is that of peak human potential. This means that the individual is stronger,[7][36]faster,[7][36]and more durable than the finest human athletes.[36]They are capable of lifting around 800 pounds over their heads,[20]running at speeds of 30 mph or possibly more,[37]and due to the Super-Soldier Serum's ability to counteract the lactic acids in the muscles that cause fatigue, allowing individuals to maintain strenuous physical activity for up to 12 hours on end before tiring.[7]For example, a policeman stated Josiah's stamina allowed him to \"almost never [tire].\"[7]The Super-Soldier Serum increases the individual's metabolism, allowing them to heal faster than normal humans.[38]The Super-Soldier Serum also increases the individual's durability, enabling them to withstand falls from several stories high,[37][39]gunshots,[40]etc. The Super-Soldier Serum also grants individuals immunity to any disease, illness, and poison known to man due to their bodies' ability to process it faster than the effects can cause harm to their body.[41][22]This includes most known drugs and alcohol which has no effect on the Super-Soldier Serum recipient; for instance, Steve Rogers stated that his enhanced metabolism does not allow him to get drunk.[42]\nThe Super-Soldier Serum can also affects the brain, allowing individuals to retain and recall any information they take in, such asCaptain America, who possesses enhanced mind and is capable of remembering any military tactic and can apply it to any situation.[43]The Super-Soldier Serum increases the individual's reflexes beyond those of normal humans and non-enhanced peak humans.[44]For example,Black Widowwas able to dodge gunfire fromRapido's cybernetic arm.[44]The Super-Soldier Serum dramatically prevents individuals from aging due to the regeneration of healthy cells.[22][7]For instance,Dr. Kudrinhas stated that Natasha \"don't age as fast.\"[22]\nOn a punk rock-themed reality ofEarth-138,Karl Morningdewwas injected withSuper-Insurgent Serumto becomeCaptain Anarchy.[45]\nWithin this universe of its deceasedDavid North, an alternative version of the Super-Soldier Serum had been developed by the harsh world's governmental science divisions conglomerated into a massive think tank. The item of interest was clearly a Superior product from most other Earths given that it not only gave vastly enhanced physical anatomies but bestowed myriad superpowers to anyone who ingested it. This came at the cost of severe physiological structural breakdown causing the taker of which to violently explode. Hence the motto many soldiers in the service of the alien incursion earth's defense forces \"When it comes your time to die, sing your death song and die like a hero going home.\" in short it grants one phenomenal superhuman capabilities at the cost of one's life which relates to a couple of weeks to a few months at most. A Brazilianmutantin the reluctant service of a criminal arms dealer by the name ofVolgaused his powers for the theft and allocation of weapons-tech across the infinite realities on his employer's behalf. When he first presented this product to the billionaire weapons enthusiast, he couldn't help but be over eager to field test its effects to ascertain more sizable profit margins for his business, naturally doing first troubleshooting upon the latter's own family with which he forced the former's servitude. After a few years of off the record experimentation with the serum dubbed by many as theVolga Effectwhich weaponizes the mutant genome in order to bestow more stabilized, albeit still viciously self-destructive superpowers upon anybody who intakes it.[46]\nUltimate Steven Rogers is in the process of the Super Soldier Serum at the Operation: Rebirth.\nThe Ultimate line simplifies many random elements by having many of the world's superheroes connected toCaptain America's Super-Soldier Serum in some form or another. The Hulk was accidentally created whileDr. Bruce Bannerwas trying to recreate the serum,Norman Osbornaccidentally createdSpider-Manwhile attempting the same thing with theOz Formula, which later mutated him into the Goblin.Weapon Xand the entiremutantrace were created as the Canadian response to the serum, and so on, resulting in international Super Soldier escalation and treaties being proposed to curb it. SeveralSpider-Man rogueswere subjects of secret, illegal Super Soldier experiments. Captain America's illegitimate son withGail Richardswas born with the serum in his DNA. After his father's presumed death duringWWIIand taken from his mother, the son is raised on an army base where he appears to be a well-adjusted, physically superior and tactically brilliant young man who greatly resembles his father. However, his easy-going personality was a ruse. Around the age of seventeen, he kills over 200 men on the base and then cuts off his own face which leaves a \"Red Skull\" to reject his father.[47]Liebermanwas another person subjected to the serum, but on a night out he was involved in a fire scene and bravely rescued fifty-seven fire victims, but after saving them, he suddenly died. His body was taken back to theTriskelionand privately examined in which the cause of his death was determined to be due to his nervous system collapsing from the strain of the Super-Soldier Serum. However, Lieberman's ascension to become (and replace) Captain America and his sudden death wasn't the first time that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been trying to replicate Super-Soldiers like Captain America, and that several other candidates like Lieberman perished with similar results.[48]Furious at the invasion ofIraqby American Super-Soldiers, scrawnyIraniteenagerAbdul Al-Rahmanvolunteered to undergo medical treatments to gain superhuman abilities that would allow him to strike back atAmerica. The treatments were successful, and Al-Rahman rapidly gained muscle mass and an athletic physique. He was the first person since Steve Rogers to be positively responsive to the Super-Soldier Serum.[49]\nIn this universeSteve Rogerswas recruited to join the Super Soldier Program, due to unbreakable fighting spirit and strong will. Through the Super-Soldier Serum, created by Dr.Abraham Erskinesoldier Steve Rogers was transformed into Captain America.[50]\nIn this universe, the Super-Soldier formula createdCaptain Americaand was destroyed by Nazi spies. However, other scientists were able to create an imperfect version of the serum. Thus, each of five volunteers were affected differently, with their own unique powers which were very different from Captain America's. Also, their powers weren't permanent, and they were forced to ration their powers with keys. The five volunteers and Captain America formed theSix American Warriors.[51]As a 13-year-old boy during World War II,John Hardeskywas tricked by Nazis into spying on the creation of Captain America, memorizing the formula used to create him. However, he then realized that he had been tricked and refused to reveal the formula to the Red Skull, fleeing. Hardesky grew up to be the Cat, a highly experienced burglar.[52]He also fathered a daughter named Felicia. When he was caught in the midst of a jewel theft, the Cat was incarcerated in S.H.I.E.L.D., partly to protect his knowledge of the Super-Soldier formula. Years later, he was abducted from custody by the Kingpin, who attempted to force him into revealing the formula. Hardesky did so after the crime lord kidnapped his daughter, and the recreated serum was tested out on her. As a result, Felicia became a crimefighter known as the Black Cat, and teamed up with Spider-Man to save her father, who then allowed himself to be taken back into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody to protect his knowledge.[53]\nBecoming a super soldier\nCaptain America is born.\nDr. Abraham Erskinedeveloped his Soldier-Soldier Serum while working in Germany.[38]However, a Nazi General,Johann Schmidtknown as Red Skull used the serum to increase his physical & mental abilities, however the formula appears to have been either prototypical or flawed, the resulting effects heavily distorted Schmidt's facial tissue and skin complexion becoming the Red Skull. Dr. Erskine later explained to Steve Rogers that the formula not only enhances the user's capabilities but also amplifies their 'key traits,' causing different features according to the user's personality, which caused Schmidt's face to mutate.[38]\nDr. Erskine escaped to the USA, he joined theStrategic Scientific ReserveThere he took part in Project Rebirth, a project to create a Super Soldier for the Allies.[38]UsingVita-Raysto unlock the serum's potential, Dr. Erskine successfully used the Super-Soldier Serum onSteve Rogerswho became the hero dubbedCaptain America.[38]Dr. Erskine was killed and the last vial of the original serum was destroyed byHeinz Kruger, one ofHydra'stop agents.[38]The last remnants of the serum now only exist in Steve's blood.[38]Despite the success in creating a super soldier, Project Rebirth was effectively a failure, the goal of the US military was to produce an \"Army\" of soldiers; not just a single individual.[38]With Rogers too valuable to risk in Frontline action, being the only guinea pig from which valuable data could be obtained, he was used by the Army as a recruitment tool, in a sense creating the very Army using regular people.[38]\nDuringBucky'sincarceration in a Hydra prison, he was too injected with a serum which gave him enhanced physical abilities, similarly toCaptain America. This allowed him to survive the fall from the Swiss Alps. Later after being discovered by HYDRA, further enhancements, rigorous training & brainwashing has transformed him into theWinter Soldier.[38]\nIn 1991, Hydra Operatives have learned thatHoward Starkhas recreated 5 more Super-Soldier Serum.Vasily KarpovdispatchesWinter Soldierto retrieve the Super-Soldier Serum. Barnes assassinated Howard and Maria Stark. Barnes also retrieved the 5 recreated Super-Soldier Serum. Karpov recruited 5 more test subjects and injected the Super-Soldier Serum.[54]\nIn the 21st century,General Rossof the US Army revived the bio-tech force enhancement program, a secret project set-up after the relative failure of Project Rebirth. A failed attempt to reproduce the serum with added bouts ofGamma Radiationled to the accident that turnedBruce Bannerinto the Hulk. Banner was later forced to flee from Ross, who employed the British soldierEmil Blonskyto track him down. General Ross, eager to sustain Blonsky's will to fight, gave him an injection of a similar serum, which gave him abilities similar to those of Captain America. Later combination with the altered serum in Banner's blood turned Blonsky into the Abomination.[55]"

After a pair of aliens dueled aboveEarthusing immensely destructive weapons, killing each other and burning up on entry, their weapons were left intact but scattered around the world. US satellites immediately began tracking these objects, following one as it landed in theSudanesedesert. DiscoveringHydrahad also tracked the objects, a special team was dispatched by the government to attempt to get to the item before the terrorists. Among the troops tasked with the item's retrieval was Joseph Green, a highly-decorated army sergeant. Arriving at the crash site, Green's group immediately came under fire from Hydra forces, immediately suffering casualties. Knowing that the item's retrieval was the main objective, Green left his associates to handle the terrorists while he went after the item.[5]\nArriving at the crash site and finding not one, but two items of theGauntlet Armor(a gauntlet and a sword), Green was also met by a Hydra agent. Drawing their guns to fire, the two of them found those jammed with sand, leading to a physical confrontation between the two. When the two soldiers were momentarily separated, the Hydra agent went for the more powerful (and heavier) of the objects, while Green went for the large gauntlet-like object. Putting it on, Green made short work of the Hydra agent, then discovered he was incapable of removing the gauntlet. He returned to his government with the gauntlet and the alien sword.[5]Unable to remove the device from his arm, he was dubbedGauntlet. Eventually, Green was stationed in theMiddle Eastprotecting American troops,[1]notably inIraq.[3]\nGreen served overseas until transferred bySecretary Gyrichto join theInitiativeand work as a drill sergeant.[6]Gauntlet disapproved of this choice, feeling he was more needed in the field, but Gyrich explained to him that sinceM-Day, the majority of metahumans were located in the US, and Gauntlet would train an American army of super heroes.[3]\nAtCamp Hammond, Green began training a new batch of recruits consisting ofTrauma,Cloud 9,Bengal,Ultragirl,Slapstick,Hardball,Thor Girl,Rage,Komodo, andArmory. Green was monitoring the first training exercise between Armory and Trauma, along with Gyrich andBaron von Blitzschlag, when Trauma evoked Armory's greatest fear. Armory lost control and fired herTactigon(the weapon wielded by the Gauntlet Armor's alien enemy) wildly around the training room. Green got the panicked Armory under control but not before she had shotMVPin the head, killing him instantly. Armory washed out of the Initiative and the Tactigon was removed from her arm. The team was informed by Gyrich that the entire incident had never happened.[3]\nGreen led the trainees into their first combat against theTerror-Carrierwhen Hydra threatened theUS PresidentinTexas.[7]He later assisted in attempts to reuse the Tactigon, which were called off after fifty men tried without success to activate the weapon.[8]\nUsing the name of theNew Warriorsas a pejorative and derogatory term to designate poor-skilled and irresponsible super-humans, he soon earned the ire of former members, both part of the Initiative staff (such asJustice),[9]or trainees (like Rage).[10]He pushed them even harder on that subject after the cadets' disobedience during theinvasionofNew Yorkby theHulk.[11]\nJustice had originally brought MVP into the Initiative, and was shocked to discover MVPstill aliveat hishomeinKentucky.[10]As witness to MVP's accident, Justice concluded that Gauntlet was responsible for MVP's death. The two almost fought, as Green again insulted thebaby-killingNew Warriors to Justice's face. The two were restrained by their cadets Ultragirl, Thor Girl, andDebrii. Later, Rage answered a similar insult by telling Green to\"shut [his] freakin' hole\", leading Green to explain to him that he was one step from washing out.[11]\nBeaten into a coma\nThe day after, Gauntlet received a severe beating at the hands of Slapstick, leaving him in a coma.[11]He was found byTigraand\"Yellowjacket\". Consequently, all New Warriors on base (Slapstick, Rage, Debrii, Ultra Girl, and staff member Justice) were put in the brig and twoS.H.I.E.L.D.Cape-Killerswere sent to act as Military Police:Special Agent MarquezandAgent McAllister.[11]\nAs the Cape-Killers were close to discovering some of the base's secrets (including the ones related to MVP), Gyrich chose to awake Green briefly using a powerful stimulant injected by \"Hank Pym\", who made him tell his \"official record\" on how he had been assaulted byTony Stark's enemyThe Ghost, allowing Gyrich to dismiss the investigators.[11]In order to render the Gauntlet armor usable once again,Congressman Arthur Woodmanproposed to Gyrich to remove the item from its wielder, but the Secretary reminded him of the fiasco of the Armory/Tactigon situation.[5]\nWhen MVP's evil cloneKIAwent on a rampage with the Tactigon, killing everyone involved in his original's death, the gauntlet took control of Green's unconscious body and broke into the Omega Weapons Cache to seize and wield the sword that had fallen along with the gauntlet.[12]The two alien-powered soldiers found each other and battled, but KIA used the Tactigon to awaken Green and disable the Gauntlet's control over him. He was saved by the timely interference of theScarlet Spiders.[13]Surviving, he attended both the viewing of Trauma's coffin (witnessing his resurrection) and the ceremony for the first graduating class.[14]\nDuring aninvasionof Earth by theSkrull Empire, Gauntlet witnessed the arrival of a panicked3-D Manto Camp Hammond.[15]Following the shutdown of every piece of Starktech due to an alien computer virus, he andTaskmasterattempted to ensure the safety of the cadets at Camp Hammond by locking down the facility. However, \"Yellowjacket\" (a Skrull infiltrator, Criti Noll) ordered Gauntlet to send the Initiative cadets to help fight the Skrulls inNew York City.[16][17]\nThe Initiative arrived inTimes Square, rescuing theYoung Avengers,[17][18][16]but were soon taken down by theSuper-Skrullswho knocked out Gauntlet. The invaders started to executing the cadets, starting withProton.[19]Both Young Avengers and Initiative were saved by the timely arrival ofNick Furyand hisSecret Warriorswho repelled the Skrulls enough time for the speedsterYo Yoto pick up the heroes, including Gauntlet, and hide them all in one of Fury's secret bases.[20]\nEventually, the joint forces of Gauntlet's Initiative team, the Young Avengers, and the Secret Warriors teleported toCentral Park, coinciding with the return ofThor,Captain America,Reed Richards,Agent BrandofS.W.O.R.D., and bothNewandMighty Avengersfrom theSavage Land. As the Skrull EmpressVerankeand \"Pym\" gathered their troops, the heroes, joined byHoodand hisarmy of super-criminalsplusNorman Osbornand hisThunderbolts, all assembled to take down the alien invaders.[21]Once the battle was won, Gauntlet was among the heroes to welcome the returned kidnapped humans, but had to temper the enthusiasm ofProdigy, as joy couldn't fit with the loss ofWasp, a foundingAvenger, in the battle.[22]\nFollowing the end of the Invasion, Gauntlet had to deal with protesters manifesting around Camp Hammond, whom he dismissed using his alien device. As Hardball's loyalty to Hydra was confirmed, and as he was onMadripoor, a foreign country with bad relations with the new administration of Norman Osborn, Gauntlet needed to deploy theShadow Initiativeto grant deniability to the Initiative. Gauntlet happened to be in charge of both the Hammond facility and the strike team, as Gyrich had been expelled by Iron Man a long time ago,War Machineresigned from the Initiative, \"Pym\" had been a Skrull, the real Hank Pym refused to join, and Gauntlet refused that Blitzschlag became commander. His first act was to assemble the Shadow Initiative, now led by Taskmaster and joined byKomodo, the closest person to Hardball as she was his ex. He confrontedMutant Zero, canceling the deal she had with Gyrich to stay in her Zero Room instead of attending briefings, and Komodo about her desire for revenge on Hardball.[4]\nGauntlet tried to keep as more experienced staff on base, but many of the other instructors left, unwilling to place themselves under Norman Osborn's control:Stingrayfinally got his dream assignment as leader of thePoint MeninHawaii,Hellcattook back her post as the onlyAlaskan-based Initiative agent,Gargoyleleft, having fought for his country sinceWorld War I, andTigratook over as leader of theArkansas'BattalionInitiative team to trainRazorbackwho wanted to replace hisSkrull impersonator, and needed training.[23]\nGauntlet vs. Ragnarok\nRagnarok (Thor's cyborg clone)awoke due to Skrull Pym's machinations: \"Pym\" had planted a failsafe that would reconstruct the clone if he didn't return to enter an idle code.[4]Ragnarok started to rampage in the Camp, forcing Gauntlet and the Initiative (graduates, quitters, cadets, and staff) into a fight. They were quickly rejoined by the newly reassembled New Warriors.[23]Protecting civilians, Gauntlet led the charge against the cyborg, removing him from the town to stop his rampage. Ultimately, MVP and Blitzschlag proved the truth about his origin to Ragnarok, making him leave the town.[24]\nOnce the fight was over, Gauntlet announced to the Warriors their status as fugitives, but stood by as they revealed the unethical practices of the Initiative to the world.[24]Interrogated by reporters about his own knowledge in those affairs, he preferred to elude the question and went to help the town. He was soon asked the same question by his teammates, and revealed he indeed knew. An argument then broke between the staff (especially Tigra andSamson) and Green, with the last accepting the responsibility for hiding MVP's death, although Trauma backed him up, while Blitzschlag and the military were blamed for Ragnarok.[25]\nNorman Osborn arrived during this discussion, closing down Camp Hammond, announcing S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dissolution, and the establishment ofH.A.M.M.E.R.among other plans. As Gauntlet asked for clarification, Osborn dismissed him, asking him to leave the camp for a motel with his family and to wait for new orders. Osborn then left the place, letting an angry mob demolish the camp.[25]Leaving the camp with his family, he was asked for help by Mrs. Trann (Bengal's wife) who was cut off from her husband, as he was still on mission with the Shadow Initiative when S.H.I.E.L.D. (who was supposed to pick them up) was dissolved. Gauntlet went to Norman Osborn andVictoria Hand, refusing to leave until Osborn gave him (fake) assurances about the S.I. status. That visit made Osborn ask for Green's file, finding him \"annoying\".[26]\nAlong with Blitzschlag, Reed Richards, and other Initiative scientists, Gauntlet met withStar-Lordand theGuardians of the Galaxy, who warned them aboutBlastaar's army, his takeover ofPrison 42, and his attempts to invade Earth. They took Quill's advice seriously but were all skeptical of the team they were facing, having never heard of them.[27]\nGauntlet was later summoned to theAvengers Toweralong with Tigra and assumed that their meetings were either about them being fired or reassigned. Green was partly right for his own case, as Osborn removed him from his drill instructor status and had reassigned him to the Middle East back with his former unit. His joy was short-lived, as Osborn wanted to keep the alien gauntlet, having no trouble with it being bounded to Green and taskingAresto do what was necessary to liberate it. Gauntlet shattered the window of the Tower and escaped, giving Tigra a distraction to escapeMs. Marvel (Karla Sofen)who was tasked to \"escort\" her, as Tigra was carrying ahuman/Skrull hybridfetus that Osborn wanted to acquire. Immediately, Osborn wanted to dispatch hisAvengersto track them down, but the Hood, now part of the Initiative along with his gang, chose to sendLiving Laser,Griffin,Razor-Fist, andScorcher. Gauntlet reunited with Tigra in the sewers, and proposed to split while Tigra insisted they stay together. Trapped by the four trackers, they were saved by the timely intervention of the New Warriors who wanted to make amends for being partially responsible of Camp Hammond's closure and to take down Osborn. The two fugitives joined the team but Tigra thought that with Osborn corrupting the name of \"Avengers\", and with the Warriors including herself, Justice, and Rage, all acting in the past as Avengers, the team had to evolve, becoming the Avengers Resistance.[28]\nGauntlet then started to fight theDark Reignof Osborn, opposing theU-FoesinCharlotte,North Carolinato giveNight Thrasherenough time to access the criminals' databases. Unfortunately, their status as fugitives, opposed to the U-Foes being the Initiative team of North Carolina, put them under fire by the police forces, forcing them to retreat rather than fight back. Gauntlet's energy powers proved useful in those fights, as well as his leadership qualities helping to knock down the tensions between Rage and Night Thrasher, and boosting the Warriors' motivation.[29]He was also part of the rescue of theHeavy Hittersafter they seceded from the Initiative.[30]\nFollowing the mission and the capture of Night Thrasher by the H.A.M.M.E.R., the Warriors performed an expedition onCamp H.A.M.M.E.R.in order to free him, and Gauntlet was tasked with causing maximum damage to the installations and disorienting the enemy agents, along other New Warriors powerhouses.[31]They were soon stopped byPenance, andNightmarequickly overcameTrauma, confronting both New Warriors and H.A.M.M.E.R.'s Initiative. Once Thrasher was taken back and the Warriors retreated (thanks to a ruptured gas main blocking them from Hood's men), Gauntlet made contact with their mole in Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.,Diamondback, just before she was surprised byConstrictorwho discovered her true allegiances.[32]\nAs theMighty Avengerswere inTibetbattling the exiled and vengefulInhumanking known as theUnspokenalong thePeople's Defense Forcesuper-team ofChina, they tried to recruit all Avengers teams available. Young AvengersStatureandVisioncame to the Avengers Resistance headquarters, offering their help to Tigra, Rage, Gauntlet, and Justice, Gauntlet highlighting the fact that they were the only ones of the team available. After attending a briefing at theInfinite Avengers Mansion, the reunion of Mighty, Young, New, and Resistance Avengers transported themselves from the Mansion to Tibet though an Infinite door, forcing the Unspoken to rush into the battle.[33]Although most of the Avengers and Chinese heroes were turned intoAlpha Primitivesdue to the action of theXerogen,[34]Gauntlet was able to stay free for a time, fighting back-to-back withRadioactive Man, but was presumably transformed as well when Xerogen gas was spilled all over the battlefield, and then reversed back to normal by Henry Pym.[35]\nAs Osborn launched anassaultonAsgard, Justice decided to attack Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.[36]Part of the raid, Gauntlet battledOutback (Boomerang)and the Living Laser before being taken down by theHoodusing his newNorn Stonespowers.[37]Rising again, he had to battle the magically enhanced Living Laser but refused to stand down, while Penance, Bengal,Batwing, andButterballjoined them. Once a large part of the Hood's trainees and fellow criminals were sent to the battle on Oklahoma, the Avengers Resistance took the opportunity to win the battle.[38]\nAt some point in the battle,Lokitook back the Norn Stones power from the Hood to enhance the heroes, seemingly affecting the Avengers Resistance and the Initiative deserters. Taking the advantage, Gauntlet rushed Scorcher, exploding his armor. Along with Justice he accepted the surrender of some reluctant H.A.M.M.E.R. agents, rejoiced with Ultragirl at the end of Osborn's reign, and was seen at the party at theStark Tower.[39]\nIn the aftermath of Osborn's fall, Gauntlet asked to be deployed toAfghanistanto serve along with his former Army unit.[1]He was instead stationed at the Camp Leatherneck, in Helmand Province, he was asked by fellow soldiers why he refused to join the Avengers, as those soldiers admired the returns ofCaptain America, Thor, and Iron Man. He answered critically that the real heroes never left.[40]Later, Gauntlet was pushed away from the army, seemingly by their attempts to acquire his gauntlet.[41]\nGauntlet started working as security forBaintronics. During the demonstration of a new multi-purpose tank named theManticore, the show was interrupted by Iron Man and War Machine, as the vehicle had been developed using illegally-appropriated Starktech. Gauntlet, unaware of such illegality, took on Stark and managed to subdue him, with his gauntlet draining the power from the hero's armor. Sergeant Green was knocked out by War Machine, who had taken control of the Manticore.[41]"

He notes that sometimes it worked, and other times it didn't, but that making things up as he went along made it so that he didn't have to ask for help - something that's not an option in space. Flash reveals that this time he made a plan and asked for help. Pik retorts that once she's regained her strength she'll kill him, but Flash tells her they're right where they need to be. Pik responds by asking him if his partner is where it needs to be.\nOverlooking a massive army, Mercurio revels in being bonded to the Venom symbiote, noting that he can feel its ravenous hunger and that Flash kept it starved, promising that he will keep it well-fed. Mercurio outlines his plan to conquer the Gramosian Empire and put it in its rightful place in the galaxy, destroying any who stand in their way - starting with Flash Thompson.\nAs the prison door unlocks, Flash quips that Mercurio is right on schedule. He asks how bad it is, and Pik responds that it looks like the end. Flash remarks that she's been spending too much time with 803, then tells her he was talking to the symbiote, which peels away from Mercurio and reveals he has an armada. Outraged, Mercurio commands the symbiote to obey him, but Flash retorts that being a host is a give-and-take. Manifesting its humanoid form, the symbiote begins crushing Mercurio with tentacles and pins him to the floor. As it prepares to finish him off, Flash yells at it to stop. The symbiote backs away and apologizes, and Flash realizes that letting it bond to Mercurio was a mistake. The symbiote bonds with Flash again as Mercurio picks himself up, sneering that the symbiote is a fool to reject its chance at greatness and is even weaker than Flash. Summoning guards, Mercurio orders them to kill Venom and Pik, who flee. Pik asks why they're running instead of fighting, and Venom tells her Mercurio called for backup, which is smart -- and that he also called for backup, revealing the Wugin and Bhiv battling Mercurio's soldiers. Duelling Mercurio himself, Venom introduces Pik Rollo and Iqa to each other. Fighting back to back, Iqa pointedly tells Pik she has placed a husbandry claim on Flash already, but Pik bluntly informs Iqa she has no interest in him.\nMercurio tells Venom he underestimated Flash's intelligence, but that he was right about the symbiote: it's starving for rage and hatred, but won't take what's its, calling it pathetic and weak. Roaring, Venom attacks Mercurio, who tells the symbiote that even enraged, Flash holds it back. He offers to bond with it again, but Venom roars and slams him to the ground. As Mercurio mockingly sneers that Flash is still holding it back and making it weak, Venom hefts a piece of machinery, snarling that they are not weak. As Venom pummels Mercurio with the machinery, Flash begs for the symbiote to stop. Just as Venom is about to finish the warlord off, 803 calls out for him to stop. Venom turns to see Iqa, 803, Pik Rollo, and the Bhiv watching him and regains composure, stammering that he doesn't know what came over him. Mercurio opens fire with a laser pistol, injuring Venom, and retreats into a small ship, promising that he will return and kill both Flash and the symbiote.\n803 apologizes for letting Mercurio get away and asks to be deactivated, but Venom thanks him instead, both for getting everyone there and for stopping him from going too far. Pik Rollo is reunited with her daughter, Hilla, who asks if there are any enemies left that she can kill. Pik thanks Venom, but tells him that next time he should tell her the whole plan. Confused, Venom asks what she means, and Pik tells him that he needs a crew and that she and her daughter need a home. Iqa jumps in saying she needs a quest that will win her glory in the eyes of her people, adding that she finds Venom's rage issues to be attractive. Giving in, Venom tells them that he's no captain and they're not a team, but they're welcome aboard - albeit with no pay. 803 asks what to do with the Bhiv, and Flash has the robots distributed to Cora's family and the P'qui in case Mercurio targets them again.\nOnboard the ship, Flash confronts the symbiote over its loss of control. It apologizes again, saying that being bonded to Mercurio brought out old feelings. Flash admits he knows the feeling of falling off the wagon, and asks whether the symbiote's moving forwards or backwards. After a moment of hesitation, the symbiote responds that it's moving forward. Later, Flash enjoys a celebratory meal with his new friends, thinking to himself that for once things worked out. Elsewhere, the Venom symbiote stares into a mirror, seeing its monstrous form reflected back at it.\nCAN A SYMBIOTE TRULY CHANGE ITS INKY BLACKNESS?"

When the Avengers attack, their opponent, armed with a blazing power sword and driving a fiery chariot drawn by flying robotic horses, batters his way through the heroes' ranks, abducting Rachel and appropriating the gemstone necklace given her by the Shadow Lord. In a rematch, he succeeds in defeating the entire team until Wonder Man deduces that the Shadow Lord's jewels are the means of access to the Shadow Realm of his millennia-long exile. Activating the gemstones precisely at sunset causes the Berserker to vanish into that twilight world, whereupon the Wasp's sting destroys the jewelry, trapping him there forever."

Howard,Roy Thomas,Barry Windsor-SmithFirstSavage Tales#2(June, 1973)\nmistakenly thought to beKush,[5]\"Black Kingdoms of Kush\",[6]\"Kushite Lands\"[7]\nThe Black Kingdoms is the collective name used byHyboriansfor all realms to the south ofStygia, asubcontinentofHyboriathat would eventually become the continent ofAfrica. Naturally, the kingdoms include many nations and tribes with substantially different cultures. The term merely accurately describes the dark skin color of the vast majority of the local population.\nThe northern kingdom ofKushis the one better known to the Hyborians, so Hyborians tend to assume that all people in the area areKushites. The wealthy kingdoms ofKeshanandPuntalso have considerable reputations. Their gold and their mixed-breed aristocracies are the key elements of their fame. By contrast, nearbyDarfaris a primitive land where most tribes practice cannibalism and have filled teeth.ba\nTo the south of these kingdoms, exists only one organized kingdom, the famed nation ofZembabwei. Otherwise this sub-region is home to various tribal kingdoms and confederacies. The tribes of the savannas are nomadic hunters, while those of the rain forest are sedentary. The fierce competition for land has resulted in regional wars, with tribes such as theBamulamaintaining notable warrior cultures. Just off theBlack Coastof this subregion are theSouthern Isles. Under the leadership ofBêlit, these Isles organized the Black Pirates. This southern pirate organization led raids north towards the coasts of Kush and Stygia. While Bêlit and her original crew were eventually killed, the Pirates survived them and were still active decades later.\nTo the south of this area is a sub-region of vast jungles. They are inhabited but little known to the rest of the world. A kingdom ofAmazonshas been depicted as occupying part of the area. The women are fierce warriors, the men serve as their slaves. Further to the south the jungles give way to an uninhabited desert and areas with high volcanic activity. The southernmost tip of the continent is occupied by theLand of No Returnand the isolated city ofYanoga. It serves as the last stronghold forSerpent-Men, who were forced to retreat there following millennia-old conflicts.[9]\nThere was a tongue understood throughout the Black Kingdoms (with \"Amra\" being one of its word, meaning \"Lion\").[8]The word \"Amra\" has been shown to be known inKushandKeshanat least.[10]"

Those Amazons were descendants of the Amazonian queenOrtreraand ofAres,God of War.\nHaving persisted into theModern Age, and documented to have been active as mercenaries over 20,000 years ago, during thePre-Cataclysmic Age(while a few groups were known as \"Amazons\" during theHyborian Age, any relation between them and the Amazons witnessed inAtlantis,GreeceandTroyremains unconfirmed), the Amazons are one of the oldest nations onEarth.\nThe Amazons fighting theGorgonsonAtlantis\nThe Amazons were a fierce tribe of warrior women during thePre-Cataclysmic Age, and offered their fighting skills to other nations.[5]\nOver 20,000 years ago, the Amazons, ruled byQueen Myrina, were hired byAtlantis, now a decadent nation, to root out a nest ofGorgonsfrom theWestern Peaks of Atlantis. Myrina had some Gorgons captured, in order to continue the line within the Amazon nation. A garrison was left behind to collect the payment, but was slain, as the Atlanteans hated the warrior-women and wanted to avoid payment, thus earning the eternal hated of the Amazonian nation. Wishing to protect their power, the Atlantean council of sorcerers tried to harness a fraction of the power of theAxis Mundi, but were unable to control the energies, causing theGreat Cataclysm[6][5]or rather furthering it.[5]\nDuring theHyborian Age of Conancirca 10,000 BC, the (fair-skinned)[7]Amazonslived in theValley of the Amazons[3](or \"Hidden Valley\"), in the fabledSecret City of the Amazons,[4]inHyboria. The custom of slaying their male mates,[3]as well as any male from entering their domain, was already law to those Amazons. Those Amazons held a death-match arena known as the Circle, in which the victorious survivor mated with the Queen before she slew him.[4]\nWhenConanwas let free byQueen Brynwho showed him the secret tunnel out of the city after their mating,Mabtook the lead, imprisoning Bryn and hunting Conan. Conan himself stumbled onto the vanguard of theLegion of Freebooters, that had come to plunder the valley and sell the Amazons into slavery.[3]The Amazons pursuing Conan reached him at this moment and a fight broke, in which Conan turned on the Freebooters to letDanaewarn Bryn. They returned and timely stopped Mab from executing Bryn for having violated the law of the Circle. Meanwhile, a survivor of the Freebooters dragged the horde ofMalekhar the Morose. Conan slew Malekhar, and swore to never reveal the tunnel leading to the Amazons' domain before departing. Mab shot at him with a her bow to respect the law of the Circle and Conan left, believed dead, in fact protected by Danae's shield on his back.[4]\nAt least three other groups of women warriors were known as Amazons in Hyboria in the same era (their relations to the Amazons, if any, remains unrevealed):\nTheAmazonsofGamburu\nSeveral thousand years later, the Amazons founded their own city,Themiscyra, on theThermodon River(inmodern-dayTurkey). Hippolyta, daughter of the Amazonian queenOrtreraand ofAres, theOlympian godof war, was born (nearRiver Tanais, near modern-dayRostov-on-Don,Russia).[16][5]Some account have Otrera described as the first queen of the Amazons.[16]Echidna stated that, despite the Amazons being the offspring ofAres, she always thought them to be as her own.[2]\nLysippesucceeded to her mother Ortrera as queen of the Amazons, but was killed in combat. Hyppolita then succeeded to her sister.[16][5]\nIn 1270 BC,Herculeswent toThemiscyrato steal thegirdleof Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, a gift from Hippolyta's father Ares, as part of hisTwelve Labors. However the moment the two met it was an instant attraction and the two went to bed together. This happiness from Hercules angeredHera, who took the form of one of the Amazons, and made them believe Hercules was kidnapping their queen. He escaped completely naked, carrying the girdle and chased by the countless Amazons.[17]\nLater, Hippolyta used arcane magic to invert the gorgons' stone-making abilities and turned a statue into flesh, her daughterArtume, aiming at the creation of a more perfect offspring.[16]\nHippolyta was eventually killed in a hunting accident by her sisterPenthesileia. She soon grew in fear of her people's reproaches and was haunted by theFuries, who tormented those who killed their kin. Along twelve fellow Amazons (Clonié,Polemusa,Derinoè,Evandrè,Antandrè,Bremusa,Hippothoè,Harmothoè,Alcibiè,Derimacheia,AntibrotèandThermodosa), Penthesilea came toTroyin order to cleanse her soul and helpKing Priamin theTrojan War.\nTricked byAthena(who favoredAchillesof theAchaeans), Penthesileia led both her Amazons and the Trojans, galvanized by the warrior woman. Despite killing many warriors, the Amazons were all slain, Penthesilea falling last after facing Achilles. Ares was enraged but forbidden to intervene, while Achilles' heart was drown in sorrow (from one fist blow, he slewThersites, who mocked his mourning.[18]The feats of the Amazons were witnessed byCole, aNeanderthalwith an extended lifespan.[19]\nThe Amazons came to exist inOlympus, where they were the most-fiercely trained warrior. Hippolyta resumed her rule as Queen of the Amazons.[20]\nTheir whereabouts in the following years are unrevealed, butHerculesstated they did \"run a little wild every hundred years or so.[21]\nIn theModern Age, Hippolyta still harbored passion for Hercules. She was recruited byPlutointo enterring an arranged marriage with Hercules, in order to prevent him from interfering with Pluto plans of conquering Olympus.[16]The Amazons were among many, along withHarpies, that stormed theU.C.L.A. Campusthrough portals, looking for Venus (whileCerberusand theMutateswent after Hercules), culminating with Ares, Pluto and Hippolyta appearing before them and their allies, stating thatZeushad decreed that Hercules was to marry Hippolyta and serve as her prince consort and thatVenuswas to marry Ares, or the universe would die.[20]This event helped start upthe Champions of Los Angeles, who ultimately foiled Pluto's plan.[16]\nThe Amazons, including Artume andDelphyne(an Amazon gorgon), fought inOlympusalong theOlympiansand against the invadingdemonhordes ofMikaboshi. Artume's resolve for conquer sprang out from the fighting.[22]\nArtume killed Hippolyta and rewrote reality, using the AtlanteanOmphalos, to have the Amazons rule the world. This plan was foiled by Delphyne who killed Artume.[16]\nGorgon succeeded Artume as the Amazonian queen, and inherited Hippolyta's seat on Hera'sOlympus Group.[16]\nHelabargained with theDeath-Lordsto have Hippolyta resurrected, more powerful, in exchange for her owing each of them a favor, \"The Twelve Labors of Hippolyta\" (which Hippolyta interpreted as the Death-Gods wishing to have her ascend to Ares' throne and bolster the ranks of the dead). She first foughtDoom Maidensfor Hela. She was then urged by Pluto to restrengthen the Amazons' ranks.\nHippolyta foundedNew Amazoniain the middle of theMediterranean Sea, and started raising an army and nation of warrior women (including Delphyne Gorgon), though intending them not as pawns in the warmongering of gods, and declared that New Amazonia would persist for eons. On Delphyne's account, some Amazons did not share Hippolyta's view and craved for a more destructive purpose.\nNew Amazonia was soon visited by the Doom MaidensAradneaandEchidnaalong with a quintet of giant sea monsters. They clashed with Hippolyta and theDefenders, until Aradnea deliveredCaroline Le Fay's message calling the Amazons to join her and sate their craving for bloodshed, leaving the Amazon nation in doubt.[2]\nWade WilsonandThrenodywent to New Amazonia as part of a paid mission on behalf ofWeaselto acquire Hippolyta's bust from the Amazonian temple, and were confronted by the queen and her Amazons, though managed to steal the bust and flee.[23]"

HowardFirstConan the Barbarian#1(July, 1970)\nSpecific periods:Circa 10,000 BC:Hyborian Age of Conan,[6]Age of Conan[7][8]\nA millennium after theGreat Cataclysm, the descendants of theLemurianrefugees who had been enslaved by the East Folk overthrew their overlords. They drove them southwest, where they slew and drove out in turn theSerpent Men. The exiled descendants of the East Folk established new kingdoms on the western side of the continent, the empires ofAcheronandStygia. Back in their former dominion, the Lemurian descendants built an empire on the civilization of the East Folk, the empire ofKhitai, and may have established the empire ofVendhya. The descendants ofThurianrefugees, who had devolved into barbarism, were now called Hybori and by 16,000 BC had established their first kingdom,Hyperborea.[9]\nOver time the Hybori moved southward and established other kingdoms. By 13,000 BC the Hybori had conquered Acheron. Within another five hundred years, the Hyborian kingdoms dominated the western part of the super continent. Toward the north, the savage Picts and the descendants of the Atlanteans, the barbarian Cimmerians dominated. Five hundred years later,Aquiloniawas the mightiest kingdom in Hyboria. The north was dominated by the barbaric Aesir and Vanir. In the steppe, theHyrkanians(descendants of the Lemurians) migrated westward and established the mighty empire ofTuran, along theVilayet Sea. On the eastern side of the super continent was the empire of Khitai, the largest dominion of them all. The masters of the vast steppe between Khitai and Turan were the Hyrkanians, nomadic horse archers.\nAt the twilight of the era, the Aquilonians overextended their empire. Cimmerians and Picts overwhelmed its frontiers, and the disgruntled soldiers of annexed peoples revolted. Fire and sword brought down the empire. It's former rivals and territories were conquered by northern invaders (Vanir, Aesir, and Cimmerians) and the hordes of the Hyrkanians. Turan and Hyrkania later collapsed, and the Vanir took over Stygia. Fifteen hundred years later, in 9500 BC, another cataclysm toppled the existing civilizations and formed the current Earth.[9]\nThe Hyborian Age dominatedEarthfrom 14,000 to 9500 BC.[9]It is sometimes simply eight thousands years after theGreat Cataclysm,[10]or three thousand years after theFallofAcheron,[11]circa 10,000, during theAge of Conan.\nOthers considers the Hyborian Age as starting circa 16,000 BC,[12]or with theFall of Acheron[13]which marked the end of theAge of Acheron,[14]circa 13,000 BC.\nTheAge of Conanwas set around 10,000 BC.[15][11][16](12 thousand years)[17][18][19][1]\nOther sources mentions the Hyborian Age as ending in approximately 8000 BC.[20]\n\n15,000 year oldmutantsin a mass grave\nA mutant civilization carbon-dated to be 15,000 years old existed in modern-dayIsla des Demonas.[21]That civilization, built by the demon-looking mutants known asNeyaphemand led byAzazelwho called himself Satan, enslaved humanity. Their civilization eventually ended when the Neyaphem were repelled to another dimension by the \"Angels\", theCheyarafim, another early group of mutants.[22]\n13,000 years ago,[23][24]Randacwas King of the Inhumans.[25]Randac is also responsible for discovering theTerrigen Mists. Subjecting himself to immersion in the Terrigen Mist, Randac gained godlike powers[26]through the activation of the latentmutantgenes carried by all Inhumans.[27]AKree Sentryexamined Randac, and judged that theKree's goals were reached.[28]TheTerrigenesisconcept provoked a schism in the Inhumans.[26][29]Many groups of Inhumans departed Attilan at various dates (names and dates are known to Attilan's Inhumans, but without much consideration from them).[30]Most Inhuman tribes left Attilan to create their own cities, or blend among humans.[26]A few of those \"Lost Tribes\" even departed into space. Some of those tribes returned to Earth centuries later.[31]\nThe neolithic revolution, and the domestication of animals by humans, was stated to date back to 9000 BC.[21]\nNorwaywas believed to have been settled more than 10,000 years ago, as the lastIce Agecame to an end.[32]\nThe Hyborian Age came to an end circa 8000 BC.[20][12][33]\nTheOlympiangods sought worshipers.

Her mother hoped she'd be a symbol with which the Amazon culture could usher in a brand new age of peace, truth and solemnity for their nation, but this scenario proved less than satisfactory to the amazonian upstart.[citation needed]\nWho being raised in their fascist semi-xenophobic culture of right-wing warrior women found her natural apathetic proclivities, due in part to having a heart of stone; exponentially worsened whenMikaboshiand his demonic armies mowed through the Olympians and she along with her clan were called to arms in their defense. It was here in the heat of battle were the Amazonian princess found her true calling which would deviate from anything her mother Hippolyta ever had in mind, and here she would begin plotting to take the world for her own after Olympus itself had crumbled.[citation needed]\nWith The Amazons now stranded back on earth after the fall of patron god and skyfather,Zeusand the destruction of Mount Olympus,[2]Artume would begin plotting behind her mothers back during sting operations headed by her Queen & tribe against various godheads such asPoseidonunder orders of the goddessHera.[3]eventually taking an Atlantean surface albatrossTriton Stationas their personal base of operations.\nWhileHippolytawas away answering summons of their goddess at theOlympus Corporationstationed inNew York City.[4]She would come to the captured fallen god inquiring about some mystic relics harbored from Atlantis' lost history, particularly a tablet belonging to the Cult of Zhered-Na which lead to a relic capable of Manipulating the Axis Mundi held in place by the TitanAtlas.[3]After having secured their fortress she would search for the supposed Eromenos ofHerculeseventually seeking both them and another of his consorts by the name ofNamoraon a secluded island.\nWhile her forces dealt with the Atlantean and Olympian a second strike team lead by Artume herself would secure the teen geniusAmadeus Chowhom she then seduced and tricked into deciphering the tablet for the location of theOmphalos.[5]When her Demi-Goddess mother had returned ordering her soldiers to stand down, Artume appeared boasting of her ascendance to the throne wherein she shot her former queen dead and decapitated her place the head on a spear in a secluded station of their headquarters.\nUpon the completion of the desired task Artume then double crossed Amadeus as well, having him locked up in the brig as she and her warriors eventually set out in an Atlantean crafted cruiser, heading towards the last known location of the Omphalos which was at the bottom of the Atlantic Trench.[3]\nWhile on their journey Artume spied how her personal shieldmaidenDelphyne Gorgonhad taken a liking to the now captive supergenius behind her back. As the two made way to the last known location of the artifact they desired her ward managed to retrieve the said relic while The Amazon Queen dealt with its abominable defenses, only for Artume to shoot Delphyne in the back with a harpoon at the first opportunity for all of her earlier infidelities against her and the Amazon culture. Going so far as to inform Cho of her former aid's demise at her hands.\nMaking their way to Washington, DC; where the Axis Mundi and Atlas' world center position had been placed after President George Washington set down the first cement block founding its first national monument as the seat of global central power. She and her forces were met with opposition by Hercules, Namora andAthena, who helped Hercules track their next likely position to take the Navel urn.[6]\nAfter inciting a ritualistic dialect to relive the titan of his burden and setting him upon the prince of power as a distraction, Artume continues to chant to the mystic object in order to shift the axis of reality to her own demented image. Even sticking through it when her stolen transport was brought down in the ensuing battle of gods and mortals; until it is knocked out of her hands by a bullet fired from her excommunicated right hand woman by aid of an escaped Amadeus. During the hustle and bustle of reality shifts between the various hands who possessed the universe altering item in question, Artume snuck in a cheapshot against its last handler before completing the chanting rite which enabled her to take thereigns of realityinto her hands.\nThis short lived world where Amazonia reigned supreme and steadily began to winnow the male populous of the world to the point of extinction was undone with the death of its creator in it, resulting in the demise of the former Amazon queen in the mainstream. Upon her demise, Artume reverted back to stone and crumbled to dust as the Amazonian gorgon was crowned as the new queen of the Amazons.[7]"

Enraged, Hercules killed Lycus but his family as well.\nHercules' followers decided to accuse Hera, and Hercules didn't corrected them, too ashamed. He change from Herakles to roman Hercules, in order to distance himself from Hera.[2]\nWhen his sanity returned, he received instructions from the oracle inDelphito go to Tiryns and perform any Twelve Labors devised from him byKing Eurystheus[3](the final being already accomplished).[2]\nBy successfully completing these labors, Hercules would not only pay for his crime, but also achieve immortality and take his rightful place among theGods. Reluctantly, Hercules agreed to submit to the will of the hated Eurystheus.[4]The Labors included:\nLernean Hydra\nAugean Stables\nIn the course of these Labors, Hercules provoked the wrath of three immortals who remain his enemies to this day. By slaughtering the man-eatingStymphalian Birds, he enraged the war godAres, to whom they were sacred.[6]In temporarily capturingCerberushe offendedHades, the lord of that realm.[citation needed]By killing the Nemean Lion, the Hydra and other creatures spawned by the inconceivably grotesque and powerful monster Typhoeus, Hercules gained the bitter enmity ofTyphon, the immortal humanoid offspring of Typhoeus and aTitaness.[citation needed]\nIn the modern eraKing Eurystheusis revealed to be still alive. Hercules was dragged before him, who recounted his history and how he came to live again. He felt ashamed at his defeat at the hands of Herc, since he himself has fallen so low. He wanted Hercules to perform twelve \"New Labors\" so that he will be viewed as a hero again. The hero that people at one time built monuments to, and sang songs about. Hercules accepted the challenge and left to prepare.[3]\nHercules returns to the world of mortals, his labors complete, and stormed against Eurystheus and Achelous, and they both wind up dead. Later, at a celebration, they wonder where the guest of honor is and they are all told that he had said he had someplace he had to be. At the graves of his murdered family.[1]"

The strife began after the Trojan princeParisabductedHelen, wife ofMenelausofSparta. Menelaus persuaded his brotherAgamemnonto lead an army against Troy.[1]When Menelaus demanded her return, the Trojans refused.[1]\nAt Aulis, troopships gathered, led by the greatest Greek heroes:Achilles,Patroclus,Diomedes,OdysseusandAjax, among others. In order to win favorable winds for the journey, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia toArtemis. The winds came and the fleet set sail for Troy. For nine years the Greeks ravaged Troy's surrounding cities and countryside, but the city itself, well fortified and commanded byHectorand other sons of the royal household, held out.\nWhile battling someStorm Giants,ThorandLokidiscover the crack in the ground that once led toOlympus. This time, strange mists rob Thor of his memory as he and Loki get separated in the cavern. Once through, he meetsAeneasand found himself involved in the Trojan War.

Aeneas took Pandarus with him on a chariot for him to attack Menelaus at close range, but he was slain byDiomedes(manipulated by Athena as well). As Aeneas went to help the fallen Pandarus, Diomedes struck him with a massive rock and attempted to slay Aeaneas, who was timely protected by Aphrodite, then by Thor. Thor evacuated Aeneas within the walls of Troy, where he asked the Norse God to heal him for him to return to battle.[2]\nAchilles was one of the greatest warriors in the battle virtually unstoppable. But was hit in his vulnerable heel with a poisonous arrow shot byParis I, killing the great warrior.[2]\nAfter his adventures, and a battle withZeusafter regaining his memory, Thor returns to the cavern where he meets Loki. Loki told him that he had lost his memory as well, but contributed to the war in his own way by telling King Odysseus of Ithaca about a horse.[2]\nFinally the Greeks built a large hollow wooden horse: the \"Trojan Horse\" in which a small group of warriors were concealed. The other Greeks appeared to sail for home, leaving behind only the horse and Sinon, who deceitfully persuaded the Trojans, despite the warnings ofCassandraand Laocoön, to take the horse within the city walls. At night the Greeks returned; their companions crept out of the horse and opened the city gates, and Troy was destroyed.[2]\nA new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus.[citation needed]It flourished until the establishment ofConstantinople.[citation needed]"

They both briefly discuss how college life isn't meeting their expectations. They are interrupted rather suddenly when a hole in mid-air expels several green-tinted harpies who demand to know where the goddess Venus is hiding. Bobby, in civilian garb, quickly saves a fellow student from a pummeling by the harpies while Warren changes into his costume. Warren returns in time to assist Iceman, albeit without a mask to hide his identity. Warren declares he is done hiding who he is.\nWhile Iceman and Angel are battling the harpies outside, Natasha (Black Widow) impatiently paces inside UCLA- waiting for her job interview to teach Russian. Her friend Ivan is there and gives her encouragement. He asks if she seeks the job to get her mind off of her relationship with Daredevil. Their conversation is interrupted the same as with Angel and Bobby. A hole opens up and several Amazon women pour out demanding to know the location of Venus. A fight breaks out.\nAs the battle continues, the Humanities Professor Dr. Victoria Starr enters the conference room to greet Natasha. The Amazons exclaim that Victoria is Venus and seek to seize her. Natasha and Victoria make a hasty escape, leaving Ivan behind.\nMeanwhile, Johnny Blaze (Ghost Rider) rides his motorcycle onto the UCLA campus and is stopped by Cerberus. Johnny changes form to the Ghost Rider and throws a little hellfire before deciding he isn't up to the task and leaves.\nAlso on a seperate part of the UCLA campus is Hercules. He is there to prepare for a future lecture about Mythology with the lecture agent Richard Fenster. Hercules is jumped from behind by many ugly mutates and eventually they all crash through a wall and land outside where Ghost Rider is still fleeing Cerberus. Ghost Rider grabs Hercules and they both escape on his motorcycle.\nGhost Rider, Hercules, Iceman, Black Widow, Venus, and Angel finds themselves chased near each other by the various enemies mentioned earlier. They work together but can't seem to succeed until Angel takes Venus above the mob and they all see her 'Golden Girdle- Cestus'. It leaves the enemies swooning and immobile.\nWhile the heroes rehash the events that transpired- Ares, Pluto and Hippolyta appear and state that before the day is done, Hercules shall wed Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. They also state that Venus shall wed Ares. It is said that if they refuse-- the universe dies."

Comics#6(October, 1942)\nGorgonsare humanoids with hideous, broad-headed monsters with wild eyes, lolling tongues, wide mouths with enormous, gnashing teeth, clawed hands. They are one of the many mystical races created by theOlympians.\nThe Gorgon sistersStheno(\"strength\"),Euryale(\"wide-stepper\"), andMedusa(\"queen\"), were the children of the primeval sea god/demonPhorcysandCetus.[1]\nThey were considered beauties, and worshipedOlympian godsrather than theElder GodSet, their grandfather. Medusa, considered the most beauteous of the three sisters, was a chaste priestess ofAthenaonAtlantis. Medusa was flattered byPoseidon's affection for her, and succumbed to his advances on Athena's altar, enraging her.\nAthena cursed the Gorgon family as snake-haired creatures, possibly revealing their true nature (the Gorgons' snake-like features are shared by their auntIshitiand herMan-Serpentsdescendants).\nGorgons lived onWestern Peaks of Atlantisand warred with the Atlanteans for years, until the Atlanteans contractedQueen Myrinaof theAmazonsto involve her nation in the conflict. The Amazons captured many Gorgons during the battle, their descendants becoming Amazon warriors.[1]\nThe\"Brown Man of the River\"was a giant Gorgon who claimed land betweenPictish territoryandAquiloniaand was killed by ancientPicts.\nBy 10,000 BC, the Gorgons were well-known, and their threats was used by impersonators such asDelores Garde(which was defeated byRed SonjaofHyrkania).\nThe \"Brown Man of the River\" was resurrected by Pict shamanGoranda Zekwho ordered him to kill Pict kingDekanawatha Blood-AxandKing Conanof Aquilonia, lured in the river while looking for their sonsAkenakandConn.[1]\nMedusa was apparently immortal and survived into the 14th century BC on the island ofCisthene, untilPerseus, equipped withAthena's mirrored shield, thesandalsofHermes, anhelmet of invisibilitybelonging toHadesand possibly (by some accounts) a magic pouch and a diamond sickle fromHephaestusor the Argos-slaying blade from Hermes, tracked her to Cisthene, decapitated her and fled with the still living head before he could be stopped by her sisters.The legend states the winged horsePegasussprang from Medusa's body while her blood created a race of snakes.\nPerseus used the head to petrify others, including, temporarily, theTitanAtlas,Phineus(promised toAndromeda, Perseus' love), an by some accounts Phineus' army and Andromeda's parents, andKing PolydectesofSeriphos, along with his nobles. He also apparently turned the king's island to barren rock. Perseus eventually gave Athena the head, which was ultimately left in Greece.\nAt least 300 years ago, a group of Gorgons somehow leftEarthand founded a civilization on another planet. They claimed to be descendants of Gorgons who witnessed the battle opposing Perseus and Medusa.[1]\nAfter Medusa's death, her daughter relocated to subterranean world belowAthens-Medusa-Land. Medusa's daughter, who took her mother's name, became the ruler of the city. Her descendants, each took the name Medusa and ruled the city after the deaths of their mothers.[citation needed]\nHalf a century after Medusa's death,King KreonofPylossentHerculesto retrieve the gold of Medusa from theIsle of Fear. On the island he encountered Medusa, alive and well, concealing her face behind a hood. Hercules and theArgonautsended up slaying her once again. With Medusa's death,Jasonand all her prior victims reverted back to flesh.[2]\nIn the 1920's, the GorgonMay Dusabecame a famous photographer.[3]\nDuring the same era Professor Lansing discovered the Medusa-Land and attempted an expedition to discover it's riches.[citation needed]\nSome time later Medusa moved toParis,Francewith a blind man fromGreece, her husband. He wins an art competition by using one of Medusa's victims as an art piece.[citation needed]\nAt some event Medusa or one of her descendants became imprisoned by a curio shop owner. A robber was turned to stone upon discovering Medusa behind a vault door. The shop owner placed the criminal's stone body in his shop. Some time later, a customer wanted to know the story behind the \"statue\", and the owner told him; the customer did not believe him, but when the owner challenged him to open the door himself, he fled in terror, convinced.[citation needed]\nYears later Mr. and Mrs. Grey bought the cursed European castle with Medusa imprisoned inside. Mr. Grey unknowingly released Medusa from her prison, but she failed to turn to stone. Thinking that her own curse had been somehow lifted, she looked at herself in the mirror turning herself to stone.[citation needed]\nIn modern times the head of Medusa was found in an archaeological dig in Greece by Mr. Collins. He held on to the head for many decades, until it was stolen from him by. Mr. Collins hiredMoon Knightto recover the head of Medusa. Spector managed to recover the head but in a petrified state.[citation needed]\nMedusa was brought back to life via theHand's resurrection ritual alongside with number of Ancient Greek monsters to be used byMatsu'o TsurayabaagainstWolverineand Hercules.[4]Medusa's attack was unsuccessful and resulted in beheading. Ironically enough, her head was used as a weapon against another resurrected Ancient Greek monstrosity, theKraken.[5]\nMedusa sees the bodyDeadpoolgot her."

Cerberus soon was left by his parents; Typhon was imprisoned in Mount Aetna after his insolent rebellion against theOlympians, and Echidna marched to Libya, where she kidnapped children to feed to Cerberus and his siblings. Finally, she was assassinated byArgus, a giant.[2]\nCerberus was later used, byHades, God of theUnderworld, to maintain order in his kingdom after theTitanswere defeated. Cerberus assassinated Keres, an old spirit who punished and terrified the dead, and later occupied its place at the doors of Hades, taking on his mission: to prevent those who entered from leaving, and send the living back to the world above.[2]\nFew have managed to leave Hades without the permission of Cerberus; among them isOrpheus' who, after returning from his adventures with theArgonauts, discovered that his belovedEurydicewas dead, and went to Hades to rescue her.

Deadpool heads to Bolivia to speak with his friendMontgomery, and reaches the same conclusion. Deadpool tries to think of a hero who has the skills and endurance to last in a fight with him, and decides to fightWolverine. The next day, Deadpool and his pilot,Ilaney Brukner, fly to Japan, and Deadpool disguises himself to blend in with the locals. Doctor Bong accompanies them, and notes Deadpool's hostile attitude.

Pushing the button, the sea monster enters a euphoria and leaves the ship alone.\nPulled back ashore, Howard is considered a hero and the captain of the ship holds a formal dinner and invites Howard and his friends along. When the main course turns out to be duck a l'orange, Howard runs up to the front of the ship to throw up. Resting in a deck chair, Howard is almost creamed by a giant falling rock.

When Wyndham evolved his DalmatianDempseyinto humanoid form, the being escaped and was killed by Wyndham's neighbors.[4]\nRealizing he needed isolation to work on his creations in private, Wyndham relocated toWundagore Mountainin the eastern European country ofTransia. The New Men were created there, and educated and trained in the ways of speech by way of electronic tutoring programs.[5]\nSome time later, the High Evolutionary was visited by the spirit of a 6th century sorcerer namedMagnus, who warned of the coming of the demonChthonand offered to assist in the training of select New Men as theKnights of Wundagore.[5]These brave few were able to repel the evil entity, and remained as the high guard of the Evolutionary's personal society.[6]\nWhen the New Man known as theMan-Beastwas created using a new isotope that granted him psionic powers, he quickly grew rebellious and ousted his creator from his own home. With the help ofThor, the Evolutionary was able to reclaim his castle, but decided to go into space to seek a new destiny for his creations.[7]While some, including the Knights of Wundagore, accompanied him, others decided to stay behind on Earth and establish a small hamlet on their mountain home.[8]\nThose New Men who went into space would later colonize their own planet known asWundagore II, a planet orbiting Sirius, the Dog Star.[9][10][11]However, after living there peacefully for some time, the New Men of Wundagore II began to revert to savagery and rebelled against the High Evolutionary. Needing help, the Evolutionary had theHulkcaptured and sent to him but it was not enough to prevent the New Men from mortally wounding their creator.

Howard refuses, however, as he walks away Dr. Bong clangs his bell immobilizing Howard and has his legion of mutates to take Howard to a room in the castle while he shows Beverly around. When Beverly asks how Dr. Bong can afford such an expensive set up, a castle with high tech gadgets, Dr. Bong tells her it's merely props and that nothing is functional. He then shows her the nerve center of his castle: A room with a single office setup and a typewriter.\nMeanwhile, Howard wakes up to find himself locked in a room in Dr. Bong's castle. He also comes across a book that turns out to be Beverly's old diary. Howard is interrupted by the entrance of Fifi, one of Dr. Bong's creations that is a female humanoid duck, come to bring him a meal.\nMeanwhile, back aboard the S.S. Damned, the stones suddenly vanish and all the damage (And death) caused by the strange rockfall disappear, turning out to be a clever illusion. When Dr. Bong appears and demands they leave, lest they suffer a worse fate, Winda and Paul try to appeal to the captain to help them rescue their friends Beverly and Howard. The captain refuses and sets course back for the states, Winda and Paul then watch as Dr. Bong's island suddenly disappears.\nBack in Dr. Bong's castle, the Doctor tells Beverly about his life: How he, Lester Verde, was picked on as a boy. One day, his mother encouraged him to write down silly names of the kids who picked on him, telling him that the pen is mightier than the sword. It was advice he took to heart, and soon became a brilliant writer who could manipulate the words he wrote to pretty much tell the truth but in the most devastating and damning way. When his writing style was criticized in his university writing class, he wrote an article that got his teacher fired on allegations he was a drug user. This is where, in his art class, he first met Beverly who was modeling for the class. When Lester tried to ask her out, Beverly rejected him. When Lester saw that she had a boyfriend, he used his influence to end their relationship by telling his parents that she wasn't Jewish, Lester would later be pulled out of school and eventually die in a winter car accident trying to see Beverly.\nGetting a job writing headlines for various tabloids, Lester would eventually be assigned a job as a rock critic, but to give his work some edge he eventually got involved with the rock band Mildren Horowitz and His Band, and got personally involved with their brutal and vile stage acts. During one such act, a prop guillotine ended up cutting off Lester's hand.\nAs Bong continues his story, upstairs Howard is told by Fifi that Bong intends to experiment on Howard as well in order to turn him into a creature similar to the ones that live with Dr. Bong. Not wanting to be experimented on, Howard bolts out of the room and crashes in on Bong and Beverly, but Howard is quickly subdued by Bong's creatures and taken to his lab for experimentation. Bong gives Beverly an ultimatum: Become his wife, or Howard dies."

She turns on \"Big-Wig's Bungalow\", but is disappointed that it isn't as funny as usual.  After a \"bong\" sound Big-Wig stops his usual gags, and starts talking about reading at the local library. Jen changes channels to the Fab-Rat cartoon, but after a few moments there is a \"bong\" sound, and the cartoon characters disappear, to be replaced with a real mouse being chased and eaten by a real cat! Disgusted, Jen quickly changes channel, to a \"3 Amusing Fellows\" sketch, but after another \"bong\" noise, the goofiness is gone, and one of the characters gets his head sliced open with a chainsaw!\nJen starts flipping channels to try and figure out what is going on, but then there is another \"bong\", and suddenly she is no longer in her apartment--she is in the middle of a jungle! She-Hulk doesn't have a chance to worry about what happened--she soon hears a cry for help.  Jen finds a young boy about to be eaten by a tyrannosaurus! She-Hulk grabs the dinosaur's tail, swings it around and tosses it away!\nJen goes to check on the kid, who introduces himself as Paul White.  He tells her he was using his remote control to put on his favorite cartoon--and Jen finishes by asking if he heard a strange bong.  Paul says yes, and Jen thinks this is starting to make some kind of sense. The two look around and find the characters from the \"Stonesteins\" cartoon, but they have become real Neanderthals. Jen still has her remote control, so she tries changing channels.  Suddenly they are out of the jungle and on some high-tech platform!\nElsewhere, Fifi, a French-maid, duck-woman, alerts Doctor Bong that there is a power fluctuation in his machine. Doctor Bong checks the equipment, to see what is interfering with his educational recalibration field.\nShe-Hulk and Paul find a door, and go inside the futuristic apartment, to find a married couple stuck inside, listening to George and Jane O'Rocket lecture about equality of the sexes, safe uses of atomic power, etc. This couple also got trapped inside their TV program while using their remote controls.  Jen tells them to hold on to her and Paul, while she uses the remote again.\nBack in his lab, Dr. Bong has located She-Hulk and the others.  He determines that She-Hulk's remote must be precisely attuned to his own instruments, which is how she and the others got pulled inside. Doctor Bong decides that he will have to go inside as well, to sort the problem out directly.  He tells Fifi to watch the children while he is gone, and not to touch anything--especially not the emergency manual off switch. Bong then rings his helmet-bell and disappears.\nShe-Hulk and the others arrive in the Robot-Cop show. Robot-Cop mistakes the remote control for a weapon, so he shoots and destroys it! The cyborg then tries to place them under arrest, but Doctor Bong arrives and paralyzes him. Bong then introduces himself as the genius who invented Bongvision.  He demonstrates his power, by bonging his helmet-bell, taking them through a few more channels. She-Hulk asks him why he has been warping all these shows into realistic versions of themselves. Bong tells her that it was to protect the minds of his cloned children, the Bong Quintuplets.  He found them watching Saturday morning cartoons, and was afraid that programming would numb their minds.  So, to protect them, he created a way to actually alter the programs that were being broadcast!  He also discovered an unexpected side-effect...the ability to enter the transmission and become a part of it. She-Hulk asks why he didn't just turn off the TV, rather than do all this.  He says that he was worried that it would have further damaged his kids' psyches. He tells them that they got accidentally drawn in because their old remotes operated on hypersonics. Since they are now trapped due to the destruction of their remote, Bong simply departs and leaves She-Hulk and the others trapped in the TV program.\nShe-Hulk decides that it is time to stop playing by Bong's rules and start playing by hers.  She rips the page, and she and the other civilians escape into a comic book price guide.  As they rush over to the next page, Bob skins his shin on the staple.  She-Hulk then rips another hole through the page, and they re-enter the story, in Doctor Bong's lab.  Their arrival startles Fifi so much that she stumbles back into the emergency shut off switch! Since Doctor Bong was still inside the program when it got shut down, he is now gone!  There is no \"on\" switch--only Doctor Bong's chime could activate the system.\nEven though the threat of Doctor Bong has been eliminated, Jen reminds them that they still have another problem--they still have to get home from Bong's fortress in Mongolia.\nFlashback to 3 weeks ago...Taryn and a man named Buford are staying at the Launch Pad motel in Cape Canaveral.  Taryn gets out of the shower and asks Buford how his studying is going. He tells her that it is going slowly.  Despite his mutant ability to drive anything, he doesn't want to try and make their plan work without finishing his studying. Taryn worries if maybe she is asking for too much; if her scheme is too crazy.  Buford tells her that nothing is too crazy when love is involved.  He assures her that he wouldn't have stuck around for the past few weeks if he didn't feel that this was worth doing. \"An' if Ulysses Solomon Archer is still alive out there in deep space...you and me is sure enough gonna find him!\""

Subjected to technology brought to Earth from the moonTitanby the priestessMoondragon, Angar acquired unusual vocal powers. While Moondragon hoped to create more allies against the mad Titan,Thanos, her erstwhile partner,Kerwin J. Broderick, employed Angar as a special operative for his own criminal enterprises.[5]\nAngar's first assignment was to destroy the heroDaredevil. He starts stalking the hero causing him to suffer hallucinations. Finally confronting him and challenged the hero to a fight.[5]Easily defeated by Angar, Daredevil returned home to find thatBlack Widowhas returned. When Angar used his powers to turn the Black Widow against Daredevil, the two fought the hallucinogenic criminal's powers and work together to try and stop him. However, during the course of the battle Angar used his powers to escape the two heroes. However Daredevil talked him out of becoming a murderer.[6]\nMoondragon returned to Earth to reactivate her creations: TheDark Messiah,Ramrod, and Angar the Screamer. Kerwin J. Broderick used these creations to take control ofSan Francisco.[7]Angar was out driving with his girlfriend Janice and they happen uponTerrex.

When he attempted to hug her corpse it crumbled into dust in his hands, prompting the furious Angar to go out and get revenge against Terrex. Terrex in a fight with Daredevil andCaptain Marvelordered Angar to use his powers against his foes, however Angar instead turned them against him. As the heroes kept Terrex occupied, Moondragon used her mental powers to boost Angar's powers beyond their range. They trapped Terrex in a black void with the egg of creation, when Terrex smashed it he was enveloped in utter darkness. The unlife destroyed Terrex and killed Broderick and the illusion ended together with the threat over Moondragon.[9]\nSince then, Angar used his power for personal gain, and his schemes brought him in conflict withIron Fist. Angar attacked Iron Fist withKhumbala Bey, however Iron Fist defeated them both. Stopped before he could kill Angar by Scarfe, Iron Fist found a clue on Angar's body that could lead them toColleen Wing, who had been kidnapped byMaster Khan: A Stark Enterprises identification card.[1][10]\nAngar used his powers to brainwash Colleen into believing she had to kill Iron Fist.[11]Having tracked her toEngland, Iron Fist was attacked by Colleen and even though he managed to free her from Angar's influence, he was captured by Khan's men, who were prepared to execute Iron Fist right on the spot.[12]Iron Fist and Colleen fought Angar's brainwashed soldiers. Colleen dealt with Angar using a crippling blow by slicing him across the stomach with her samurai sword. Master Khan was later drawn into a imploding rift and disappeared.[13]\nSpider-Woman (Jessica Drew)andLindsay McCabewitnessed the police hassling the Angar.

He was feared innumberless universe, and was dedicated to plunge the universe of man into evil and ruin.[6]\nAlong with his fellow Outsiders, he shambled theEarthbeforeManclimbed down from the trees.

Intending to summon Yog Sothoth at the Fingers of Sehdoula, Sulliam rounded up her consorts, and choose four of them to serve as sacrifices (the other were killed).[6]\nAt that time, a shaman of thegrasslandsofKordafa, a witch-woman in the northern reaches ofVanaheim, and a revered and renowned mystic of the East living in theMountains of the Night, had respectively visions of Yog Sothoth. The Kordafan shaman sent a group of warriors to stop the summoning. In the city ofBuryat, inShem,Vitellus, warrior priest of theCult of Mitra, came toHrotha, a mute seer, and asked him to seek Yog Sothoth, causing Hrotha to have a seizure. He was able to locate Vitellus' goal, but demanded to join his quest. During their travel, they were attacked by thieves, themselves slain byConan, who intended to rob Vitellus as well, but finally joined them (Vitellus and Conan knew each other since an earlier adventure). They were soon joined by the Kordafan warriors.\nAs they climbed the fingers of Sehdoula to stop the summoners and extinguish the unearthly fires atop the stone towers using water from the spring that sustained theProphetofMitrawhen he was lost in theRed Waste, slaying the Stygian guards on their way, the summoning started, leading Conan and the warriors to enter the domain of Yog Sothath, where they fought the strange birds of that realm, who retreated upon the coming of a part of Yog Sothoth who killed the last Kordafan warrior. Once at the top of the Fingers, Hrotha recovered speech, and killed Sullimma from an energy blast, while Conan slew the priests and put out the fires using the water, interrupting the summoning, who could not occur for another 10,000 years.[6]\nWhile imprisoned atAlcatraz,Charles Paleneperformed a ritual, using a ceremonialSacred Necklace of Rhanhe snatched from a cultist of theLibrary of Rhanand an old tome from the library's occult section, and tried an incantation invoking the name of Shoggoth,Cthuluand theGoat with a Thousand Young, which resulted in the summoning ofGoblins.[14]"

Smith,Richard L. Tierney,Roy Thomas,Esteban MarotoFirstSavage Sword of Conan#231(January, 1995)\nThePriests of Ikribuwere an order that worshiped the godIkribu, a deity allegedly far older than any in theHyborian Age.[1]\nAges ago, the order hid their most powerful talisman, theRing of IkribuinSuthad, aStygian-named city founded before theFallofAcheron(set inSouthernKothduring theAge of Conan), where was founded the High Temple of Ikribu.[1]It is unclear whether the order was active during theAge of Acheron(see notes).\nCirca 11,000 BC,Asrothschemed to resurrect the \"dreadEmpire of the Serpent\", thus committing sacrilege against Ikribu, but was slain by the magic of the order.[1]\nBy theAge of Conan, circa 10,000 BC, the worshipers of Ikribu had no temples nor cities, and roamed the world, worshiping Ikribu in ruins, caves and graveyards.\nA wizard attempted to perform a ritual of dark magic beyond his skills, and the forces unleashed awakened Asroth. Asroth quickly disposed of the wizard before fleeing. The order took responsibility to destroy Asroth once again.\nAsroth learned of the Ring of Ikribu and came to Suthad. One of the order,Sopis, traveled to Suthad to retrieve the Ring as well, intending to use it to destroy Asroth. He exhortedDuke Pelidesto warnLord Olinof Suthad of Asroth, but Pelides was in Asroth's employ at the time (though he would be disfigured by Asroth for failing to find the Ring, and would swore revenge).\nAsroth ravaged Suthad (forcing Olin and Pelides to flee) hoping to find it, in vain. In company ofRed Sonja(who had join Olin's quest to defeat Asroth), he found it just before a trap left by Asroth, a tentacled monster, erupted from the ground and slew Sopis. Red Sonja managed to defeat the beast and retrieved the Ring. Sonja kept the Ring from Pelides, but Olin and her were later threatened by the Priests of Ikribu demanding it,[1]but were all slain by Red Sonja.\nMore Priests of Ikribu followed the troop of Olin as they travelled towards the fortress of Asroth.[2]After Pelides finally obtained the Ring (after Red Sonja left its fate to the company she was part of, who voted for the Ring to go to Pelides), the Priests of Ikribu approached them, revealing that Asroth had perished, (presumably at the time) at the hand of Pelides. Both the Priests and the mercenaries entered Asroth's fortresss. The assembly discovered Pelides' corpse, slain by a poisoned needle but victorious of Asroth. The chief priest was slain by Pelides, a living corpse inhabited by Asroth"

If he had any official connection to the party or not is unknown. He developed a massive underground hideout beneath the Ohio River and developed a means to flood the river if he so wished. He formed his Cult of the River God, under the idea that if the United States did not go into peace talks with Nazi Germany, then a vengeful \"river god\" would cause the Ohio River to flood.\nHe amassed a group of followers who worshiped the swordfish. His hideout contained many such of the fish and each member had a swordfish tattooed on their biceps. The cult attracted the attention of theFBIwho planted agent John Harris to spy on the group. As the cult gained publicity, Dolvin discovered John's duplicity and causing a freak flood unleashed one of his swordfish on him. This attack was spotted by theSub-Marinerwho failed to prevent Harris from being fatally impaled or to stop the swordfish.\nHowever, learning of Harris' mission, Namor sought to infiltrate the cult as well. When meeting at their club house, Dolvin noticed that the tattoo Namor had put on his arm was incorrectly copied and tossed him into a pit of swordfish. Namor fought off the swordfish, and when he attempted to capture Dolvin, he set off a bomb in the house in an attempt to kill Namor. Both men survived, and Namor tracked Dolvin to his cult's secret hideout."

Members included theAvengers' government liaisonDuane Freemanand new superheroTriathlon(who owed his powers to the sect). After a battle between the Avengers and villainsLord TemplarandPagan,Jonathan Tremont(the leader of the Triune) publicly blamed the Avengers for the destruction, then covertly set up a smear campaign against the team to suggest they were religiously intolerant (playing on the fact that the Avengers expressed concern about why the organization forbade the Avengers from entering their church) and racist (exploiting the general lack of African-American heroes in the team) and hinting that they supported the \"mutant conspiracy.\"[citation needed]\nThanks to this manipulation of the team,Captain AmericaandThorboth temporarily resigned, Thor resenting the media criticism and Captain America feeling unable to lead the team against this kind of attack. The situation was made even worse when the Triune Understanding hired theTaskmasterto pose as Captain America and trickWarbird,Ant-Man,Silverclaw, andCaptain Marvelinto destroying a Triune building. Although they saw through his deception, the building was destroyed in the ensuing battle and the heroes lacked any evidence of their story. In an attempt to counter the Triune's claims, the Avengers arranged to have Triathlon join the team to counter the claims of racial intolerance, Triathlon eventually becoming a well-regarded member of the team.[citation needed]\nMeanwhile,JusticeandFirestar, members of the Avengers, went undercover inside the organization when the smear campaign began. One of the many secrets they discovered was that the group could power a spacecraft with the sheer belief of the followers. It was revealed over time that the Triune Understanding was trying to protect Earth from a mysterious threat named theTriple Evil.[citation needed]"

There Rachel diverged into two timelines. One Rachel became stranded the late 37th century, 100 years after Apocalypse conquered the world. Rachel soon met young Blaquesmith, who called her the \"Bright Lady\", and sensed his psychic potential, but denied his request to become her disciple. The Order of the Witnesses, founded in the late 21st century, by amutantseeking redemption, believed Rachel was the \"Lost Child of the Twelve\", descended from mutants who fought Apocalypse inmodern-day, and sent the agedDiogenes ChangandSquy'rrto observe her. Rachel, as \"Alyr'n Summerset\", attended Apocalypse's Festival of Resurrection, where she encountered his prelates,Ch'VayreandLuminesca, and battledhigh councilor Diamanda Nero, before allying with Diogenes and Squy'rr.\nOver the next year, Rachel gathered followers, under the name Clan Askani, meaning \"family of outsiders\". The Askani developed tenets, such as \"what is, is\", that fate must be embraced, and \"thanks for today, please for tomorrow\", a belief that the past brings hope, and preached that the \"Sacred Timeline\" should be preserved and nurtured through careful time travel. Rachel accepted anyone as Askani; via discipline and training, some achieved psychic power, enabling such Askani practices as mediation performed while levitating upside down. Rachel's earliest recruits included Malachi Hark, who would become the first Askani priest;Qua, anAtlanteanelemental; Lexii, last survivor of a Clone Sisterhood; and the Gibson-Sterling Mark Nine WarbotOzana. Nero ambushed the group near the Scavenger Colony, releasing the humanoid virus Plague against both the Askani and prelates Ch'Vayre and Luminesca. Qua and Luminesca died, but as Rachel destroyed Plague, she had a vision that she would \"protect the child born on the day of spring\". Nero captured Diogenes and Squy'rr, torturing them for information and then wiping-out the the Order of the Witnesses. The Askani pursued Nero, but Squy'rr and Hark were killed and Rachel was forced to release thePhoenix Forceto defeat Nero.\nThe Askani rescued several children protected by the Order, including the young Sanctity, another time-traveling telepath originally from the modern ear. Rachel later followed Sanctity back to the modern era's past, where Sanctity hoped to change the future, knowing her father, Bolivar, would invent the mutant-hunting Sentinels, Rachel stopped her from interacting with Bolivar, but Sanctity secretly planted information about the Twelve in the Sentinels' Master Mold computer. Rachel left the Askani for a time, but later returned, taking the name Mother Askani.[1]\nOver the next several years, believers deified the ancient X-Men: \"theXavier\" became a father figure, the Bright Lady a mother goddess, and the prophesied\"Dayspring\"or \"Askani'son\" their messiah. The Askani also believed in tiny winged Wysps that carried prayers and feared the monstrous Daegon, that hunted the weak in the Apocalypse's name. The Askani developed a ceremonial language, unique martial arts and thePsimitar, a weapon that focuses psionic energy. The Askani took, as their symbols, the Phoenix and the scarred eye, reminiscent of the scars around the Askani'son's right eye. Ch'vayre eventually joined the Askani, but Madame Sanctity secretly sent him to the past to found an Askani church in theAlps. Sanctity told Ch'vayre of the future exploits of the adult Askani'son, active as Cable in that era through time travel and bade him to manipulate the Askani'son into battling Apocalypse.[2]\nThe Askani first appeared whenSanctity, a time-travelingtelepathcame to the modern era, where she hoped to change the future, knowing her father,Bolivar Trask, would invent the mutant-huntingSentinels, andRachel Summersstopped her from interacting with Bolivar, but Sanctity secretly planted information about the Twelve in the Sentinels'Master Moldcomputer.[3]\nThe next time they were seen was whenMother Askanidecided to fulfill the Askani'son prophecy and, with the synthconBoak, sent aSister Askani, who sacrificed her physical body to become energy and tasked with preservation of the Askani'son, to the modern era. Sister Askani arrived just asApocalypseinfected the infantNathan Christopher Charles Summerswith aTechno-Organic Virus. Nathan's father,X-Factor's leaderCyclops, reluctantly allowed this Sister Askani to take Nathan forward to her time, to cure the virus.[4]\nLater, Mother Askani and Boak gave a secondSister Askaniinformation about various time-traveling threats and sent her to a later point in the modern ear, to keep vigilance over Cyclops andJean Grey. This Sister Askani was captured by Nathan's time-traveling adopted son,Tyler Dayspring, but helped unite Cyclops, Jean, and the adult Nathan, as a family.[5]\nLearning of the infant Askani'son's arrival, Apocalypse ordered his Canaanites to massacre the Askani, killing many Askani includingThroeblood, then seized theclone, believing him to be Nathan. Mother Askani then created cloned bodies similar to Cyclops and Jean and pulled their essences, forward from the past in order to protect baby Nathan. Ch'vayre, who had returned to the future once again loyal to Apocalypse, captured the true Nathan from Boak. Cyclops, Jean, and Mother Askani successfully rescued Nathan, but Ch'Vayre severely wounded Mother Askani, leaving her in a coma. Cyclops and Jean fled with Nathan and Mother Askani and spent the next decade raising Nathan in secret, posing as humans \"Slym\" and \"Redd Dayspring\" and joining the Askani-inspiredClan Rebellionto undermine Apocalypse's empire. Twelve years later, Slym, Redd, and a teenaged Nathan managed to overthrow and seemingly kill Apocalypse, just as the comatose Mother Askani finally succumbed to death. Mother Askani's power no longer able to fetter Cyclops and Jean in the future, they faded back to their home era, leaving Nathan on his own.[6]\nMadame Sanctity, now leading the Askani, continued to use time-travel to meddle with the past.  As Nathan grew, he befriended Throeblood's son,Tetherblood, grudgingly attended secret Askani revivals ministered by Fossil, met Blaquesmith, and became aware of the artificial intelligence\"Professor\", theCelestial-createdShip, whose consciousness had been brought forward in time with him. Nathan and his allies fought theNew Canaanites, who had risen to power after Apocalypse's seeming death, and were found, byAlyia, an Askani novitiate who Madame Sanctity sent to recruit the Askani'son.  Nathan was repulsed by the now-insane Sanctity, but the New Canaanites soon assaulted the Askani stronghold, wiping-out the Askani, and Nathan's clone, now named Stryfe, faked Sanctity's death, so she could tutor him.[7]\nNathan, Tetherblood, Aliya, and Blaquesmith determined to carry-on the Askani legacy as the guerrilla army theClan Chosen, a group that eventually includedA.D.A.M. Unit Eleven, Aliya's sisterHope, father and sonAdamandJon Spectre,Dawnsilk,Lark,Sepulcher, andSilo. Training in the Askani ways under surviving Askani elders, they repeatedly battled the New Canaanites and the Scions of Apocalypse, led by Stryfe, and the Neo-Canaanites.  When Stryfe's spy,Korless, infiltrated the Clan and Stryfe psychically attacked Nathan, Aliya brought Cable, Nathan's older self, forward in time from the modern era to heal Nathan's mind.[8]\nAfter decades of battle, the Clan Chosen signed a long-lasting peace treaty with the New Canaanites - but Nathan, upset by rumors that Apocalypse had survived, convinced the Clan's Askani Council that they need to fight again. However, ensuing battles cost the Clan dearly; Adam and Aliya (now Nathan's wife, using the Clan name Jenskot) were killed and Stryfe drove Jenskot's son, Tyler, insane - forcing Nathan to shoot Tyler and damage Dawnsilk's mind in order to save her life.[9][10]\nBelieving the Clan Chosen destroyed, the New Canaanites consolidated their power - but Nathan brought the legacy of the Askani to modern-day, traveling as Cable in hopes of defeating Apocalypse. Blaquesmith, also sent back to monitor Cable, gave Psimitars and Askani training to the long-livedDark Motherand herDark Sisterhood, hoping they would become a new Askani clan, but they later tried to kill Blaquesmith and Cable. After Cable and Blaquesmith defeated the Sisterhood, both were intrigued to learn the Dark Mother was attributed to passing down the powerful psionic powers to Jean.[11]\nCable made several attempts to spread the Askani way of life - implanting techniques and beliefs inSunspot's mind, to protect him from theMutant Liberation Front'sReignfire,[12]and inspiring religious admiration in Nigel Novotny, who became an Askani disciple after entertainment mogul, Jackie Singapore's plan to confuse Cable, by disguising Nigel as Blaquesmith failed.[13]"

Their founder wasSun Tao, an early student of Yinsen’s and fellowTimbetpalnative whom Yinsen passed his notes onto before his death. Using the schematics and theories within Yinsen’s journal, Sun Tao recruited eleven of Yinsen’s other students to help him create the aerial, futuristic city ofNew Timbetpal, and expanded their order’s followers by a literal thousandfold. Though the original twelve Sons of Yinsen constructed versions of theIron Man Armorfor themselves from the schematics within Yinsen’s journal, their society was mostly non-violent, relying primarily on Iron Man robot drones for self-defense. The Sons had also sworn an oath of silence, save it seemed for Sun-Tao himself, presumably so he could act as a spokesperson for his people.\nThe Sons of Yinsen were eventually offered the chance to recover their mentor’s brain, which had been extracted from Yinsen’s body upon his passing as part of a deal he’d made withDoctor Midasin a silent auction. Though they lost, Midas’ intermediary offered the chance to learn the identity of the person they’d lost the auction to, in exchange for their losing bid. The Sons agreed, and upon learning the winner had been Yinsen and Sun-Tao’s captor,Wong-Chu, began hunting criminal informants that could help lead them to Yinsen’s old enemy.\nIron Manfirst encountered the Sons of Yinsen inKyoto, Japan, when their Iron Man drones attacked multiple buildings in search of said informants. Despite causing notable property damage, the Sons avoided harming civilians, and made it clear they had no interest in doing so. When Iron Man encountered them again inKuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Tony was surprised to see the Sons of Yinsen treat him with a religious deference, and followed them to New Timbetpal. Inside, Tony was greeted by Sun Tao, who explained their order had long studied Iron Man, and prophesied he would someday come to them. At Sun Tao’s request, Iron Man joined the original twelve Sons of Yinsen in attacking Wong-Chu’s camp and recovering Yinsen’s brain.[1][2][3]\nHoping to effectively “resurrect” Yinsen, the Sons dug up Tony’sSentient Armorfrom where it had been buried so they could place Yinsen’s brain inside, effectively making the suit their mentor’s new body. Yet “Yinsen’s” behavior was unusually authoritarian and bellicose, commanding the Sons to replace their \"sacred armor\" with copies of the Sentient Armor, and ousting Sun-Tao for questioning his mentor’s behavior and orders. \"Yinsen\" also revealed New Timbetpal's existence to the world and established the Church of Yinsen, which quickly gained popularity worldwide.\nReplacing him with Wong-Chu's killer, Tyger Minn, \"Yinsen\" brainwashed Sun Tao and ordered him to attack Iron Man, while the other Sons stole the S.K.I.N. technology Stark had recently developed.  Sun Tao and Iron Man then battled the cloaked Sons until \"Yinsen\" attacked Stark's artificial heart. Recovering, Iron Man set out after them and Jocasta explained that she needed to confront the Sentient Armor.\n\"Yinsen\" revealed that he was actually the Avengers' old foeUltron.Jocastahad inadvertenedly given the 'Ultron Imperative' and Ultron-12's personality to Iron Man's armor when her AI was uploaded into it. The 'body' of Yinsen was actually Ultron attempting to reform himself. He had used his encephalobeam to lure the Sons, using their beliefs against him. He planned to form an army using both S.K.I.N. and the armors that had been built."

When Mr. George learned of this, he argued with Larkin who then shot him dead. This happened just as fired fisherman Mr. Svoba (a Czech-American) went to find out why he and his crew were suddenly fired. Hearing the shots Svoba burst into the office just as Larkin fled out the window. In the excitement, Svoba picked up the murder weapon just as police burst in and found himself arrested for the murder.\nLarkin and Rogers then preyed on Waterville's prejudice to form the Order of the Blue Flower, with Rogers working in secret. When Svoba refused his guilt, they rallied the gang to attack Svoba's son, Joe, who served for the United States duringWorld War II. Joe was rescued by theSub-Mariner, who then turned Joe over to Mr. Rogers as protection, unaware that he was one of the chief conspirators of the murder. Learning about recent history, Namor went to confront Larkin at an Order meeting and attempted to take him into custody for the murder of his partner. When Larkin refused, Namor punched him, the blow seemingly killing Larkin. Subdued, Namor was arrested but convinced the sheriff to have an autopsy performed on the body, learning that Larkin was really poisoned."

In modern times, the Hellfire Club became a more respectable retreat for the rich and wealthy made up of the most famous names in business, politics, and entertainment, where they could conduct business and hold parties. However, an Inner Circle of thirteen strong was at the center of the Club lead by the grandmasterSebastian Shaw, who broke off from theChurch of Shi'ar Enlightenment, seeing thePhoenix Forceas a power of destruction to be freed.[citation needed]\nThe Hellfire Club kept an eye onJean Grey, a member of theX-Men, who they believed the Phoenix was reborn into after hearing of her visions of a firebird. Seeing mutants as a possible way of freeing their God, the Club  secretly fundedCharles Xavier'sSchool for Gifted Youngstersto watch over the young mutant until the Phoenix awoke in her. The Club then lured the X-Men into a trap disguise as a gala in their honor, where they planned to finally release the Phoenix God using Jean as a vessel. However, the ritual the Inner Circle used to release the Phoenix within Jean backfired, and the Phoenix decided to kill most of the inner circle except for Shaw before transferring all Shaw's holdings and wealth to Xavier before murdering in anger for trying to control it.[citation needed]"

Originally, the Sisterhood came from women born with unusual powers banding together for protection. Called witches, these women initially adopted the name \"The Dark Sisterhood\" in defiance of their persecutors.[3]Unbeknownst to them originally, the organization's members were all descended from the mutant known as theDark Mother. In the early 18th century, the Dark Mother had seven children (all girls) who scattered throughout theUnited States. Each of these girls married and had children of their own, most of which were girls.[4]\nThese descendants, in turn, got married and raised their own families, and so on through several generations. Upon realizing their heritage, the Dark Sisterhood began recruiting exclusively from the Dark Mother's descendants.[4]When they first banded together, the Sisters sought power to save themselves from the death and torture they were submitted to by their fellow humans. But over time, their goals became twisted. They sought not just to be equal, but to rule, to replace the corrupt system they were living in with their own. In the modern-day, The Sisterhood controls huge crime cartels. It commands politicians, ambitious generals, and renegade police officers. Their ultimate goal is global domination.[3]\nThe Dark Sisterhood's modus operandi whenever they established themselves in a new city was to pick an organization to bring into submission in order to make an example for the rest. This demonstration of power was to keep others in line. Typically, this punishment was meted out to any crime organization that tried to oppose the Dark Sisterhood. The Dark Sisterhood would not only extinguish the organization, but also killed off all of its members' wives, husbands, children, lovers, companions, and live-in relatives. After this massacring, they would send the last surviving member of the crime group to the bosses and leaders of the major mobs and gangs in that city, to let them know what happened and what would be the consequences of cheating the Dark Sisterhood.[5]Throughout the world, there were criminal cartels under the Sisterhood's control, and at one point the Sisterhood was controlling half of all criminal activity in the United states.[6][7]\nThe members of the Dark Sisterhood used their psychic abilities to manipulate others to commit their crimes, though when necessary they would do carry out the work themselves (e.g. assassination, terrorism, or using sex to influence a target).[6]The Dark Sisterhood manipulated figures throughout society, including corporate CEOs, heads of state, generals, politicians, labor union representatives, and police officers.[8]In the Dark Sisterhood, there was no forgiveness, even for their own members. The punishment for failure was death.[3]Most members knew that the organization's ultimate stated goal was to take over the world. Only the highest tier knew the truth, that the Dark Mother's goal was to establish a global matriarchy. A world ruled by women, with the men, who in their view had poisoned the world, being their slaves.[4]\nAfter ten generations, the Dark Mother had almost 30,000 descendants. At the time of their confrontation withCable, the Dark Sisterhood itself had over 3,000 members.[9]As the Dark Mother saw Cable as an existential threat, the Dark Sisterhood went to war against him. They attempted to kill him twice, without success. The first time 20 of them attacked one of his safe houses, where they fought him and lost, sustaining casualties. The second time they attacked what they believed to be his new safe house which was a trap, that wiped the memories of a 100 of them. In the meantime, they isolated him from his allies and set him up in the media and government, making it appear as if he was an out of control mutant terrorist.\nCable, in turn, began to cripple many of their operations by causing the sisters in charge of those operations to lose their memory. He then prevented the Dark Sisterhood from taking over the country, when they arranged several assassinations so one of the sisters (the Secretary of Defense) could become President of the United States. Eventually, Cable was able to provided to allyG.W. Bridge, with the information he needed to convinceHenry Gyrichof the conspiracy. Government agents arrested operatives of the Dark Sisterhood within the government and law enforcement, and those men in government who were working for the Sisterhood.[10]"

Michael Straczynski,John Romita Jr.FirstAmazing Spider-Man(Vol. 2) #30(April, 2001)\nTheSpider Society(Spanish:Sociedad Araña), founded in 1099 AD in medievalSpain, venerates totemic spider deities, safeguarding their mystical balance and spiritual energies. Operating covertly,WebCorpson200 John Street,Manhattanconceals the society's true activities behind intricate corporate structures and offshore entities inBrazil. Chosen by the Spirit of the Hunter and marked by a spider tattoo, these warriors defendSpider-Totemsagainst threats like theSisterhood of the Wasp. Notable figures such as Jessica Drew and Ezekiel Sims have played pivotal roles, leveraging spider-derived powers and establishing WebCorps as a cover for the society. Continuing in secrecy, the Spider Society recruits and trains Hunters, dedicated to protecting Spider-Totems and preserving cosmic equilibrium.\nThe inception of the Spider Society dates back to 1099 AD inCastile, Spain, for the purpose of worshipingtotemic spider deities.[1]Its founding members, foreseeing the perpetual existence of crime, deliberately cultivated an environment shrouded in darkness to harness power. Were they always present to thwart misdeeds. Initially, the wasps and spiders coalesced as one organisation. Both were guardians of the arcane, benevolent facilitators of royal authority, and formidable defenders veiled within the shadows, staunchly guarding the Holy Lands during the tumultuous era of theCrusades. Delving into the writings of the Arabs, they unearthed enigmatic secrets and drew upon forgotten totemic reservoirs buried deep underground for mystical insights and safeguarding measures. However, the Spider Society's aspirations were marred by fragility, relegating them to mere participants in crusades and fools in the pursuit of their goals. This internal discord catalyzed the rift between the Spider Society and theSisterhood of the Wasp, culminating in a thousand-year schism marked by intense conflict, as they grappled over the true essence and embodiment of \"True Power\".[2]\nWebCorps, a company founded byEzekiel Sims, is based at 200 John Street,Manhattan,New York City, and is a front for the Spider Society. It is a shell company inside another shell company, inside an offshore private company incorporated inBrazilby three guys whose death certificates read one year earlier than the certificate of incorporation.\nThe Hunters are warriors chosen by the Spirit of the Hunter, and are often marked by a spider-shaped tattoo that imbues them with spider-like abilities.Jessica Drewonce worked as a Hunter for the Spider Society, and Ezekiel Sims served as a Hunter up until his death.[3]\nAnya Corazonwas believed to have been chosen as a Hunter following the death of her late mother. On her first day at a new school Anya discovered a stranger being attacked by a strange group. This Sisterhood of the Wasp attempted to kill the man, but Anya leaped in the way of the killing blow. The site was allegedly a sacred spot.[4]The man,Miguel Legar, was the sorcerer of the Spider Society, a secret group dating back for hundreds of years. Recognizing that Anya had the ability to become the new Hunter of the Spider Society, he transferred some of his power to her to save her life.[5]As Legar's partner, Anya visited the WebCorps Headquarters, a shell company used to hide the Spider Society's actions, and became suddenly involved in the war against the Wasps. When Legar got caught in a bad situation when doing reckon work, WebCorps enlisted Anya to rescue him.[6]During the confrontation, Anya was shot in her arm. The wound became a spider-shaped metallic tattoo. At WebCorps, she was informed of her birthright role as a chosen initiate for the Spider Society.[3]\nAs part of Anya's training, Legar abandoned her in the Mexican desert. After being attacked by coyotes, she learned she had gained enhanced strength and agility and the ability to manifest a protective blue exoskeleton. This allowed her to knock out several of the beasts. She then fully joined the Spider Society as their Hunter, being given a cover as an intern of WebCorps. Being given the opportunity to choose a new given name for herself, Anya rebaptized herself asArañaafter her mother's maiden name.[7]Since the Society asked Araña not to tell her father of the recent events, he became suspicious of his daughter's behavior. He demanded to meet her superior in WebCorps, and Legar met him to calm him down. Having her father's approval, Araña joined her co-workers from WebCorps Legar,Ted, andNinaon a mission to prevent the Sisterhood from empowering their own Hunter.[8]"

They have existed for centuries. In the 1400s and 1500s, many cities were built throughout Europe to act as \"spirit traps\", catching lost souls such as those that died a violent death that were unwilling to move onto the next world. Numerous fail-safes were made to both contain these spirits and keep intruders out. The cult lost influence over time and the cities were abandoned. Sorcerers of various abilities came and tried to deal with them but all failed, while the ghosts got restless.[1]\nYears ago, the Cult's leaderYagzanfound the remains ofJoseph Timms, aka the Glob. He determined that although the body was seemingly dead, Timms' brain had survived. Yagzan removed the brain, placed it in an enclosure, and brought it back to health. He also infused a portion of himself into the brain, forming a mental link with it so that he could control it in the future. Yagzan dubbed it \"the Golden Brain\".\nYagzan used the power of the brain to oppose the construction of the Omegaville energy project on behalf of his cult. However, the near-byMan-Thingsensed the anger of the men nearby, and was drawn into the conflict. A surprised Yagzan then used the brain's power to construct a golden-hued replica of Glob's body, which fought with Man-Thing, but was easily defeated. The exertion caused the Golden Brain to become so hot that Yagzan dropped it into the swamp. Freed, the Golden Brain tried to recall his lost memories. Still mostly amnesiac, the Golden Brain came back onto the land, and formed a new, human body for itself out of clay. 'Joe' as he now called himself later approached the Omegaville project, where he was hired as a worker. The cult later tracked the Glob down, and, horrified by his transformation back into a human form, Yagzan re-asserted his mental control to force Glob to devolve as much as possible. Now a mass of humanoid clay, Yagzan once again ordered Glob to destroy Omegaville. Again, the Glob was stopped by Man-Thing, who pummelled him into a shapeless mass of clay. Yagzan attempted to reform the creature, but he took advantage of his amorphous form and engulfed Yagzan completely before hardening back into his human form, suffocating him.[2]\nVictoriusregrouped the cult and, using theCosmic Cubein his possession, reformed the remains of Yagzaninto Jude, the Entropic Man, and together they started their new world order. This led to a conflict withthe Thing,Captain Americaand theMan-Thingin the swamp of theEverglades. Victorious and Jude were transformed into some sort of radiant crystal when they touched the Cosmic Cube while the Man-Thing was holding it.[3]\nYears later, the Cult of Entropy resurfaced, this time led by a man namedMahapralaya. In order to show their devotion to their cause, the cultists infected their own bodies with a variety of fatal viruses and diseases, giving them a jaundiced appearance similar to that of rotting corpses. Mahapralaya even acquired fresh recruits by way of his website www.putrescence.com. As his disciples began to grow, they met a being known as Mister Termineus who apprised them of the fact that theNexus of All Realitieshad been shattered and that such an incident threatened to destroy all reality. Mahapralaya knew that the Nexus' guardian the Man-Thing would be goaded into protecting the fragmented shards, so he set out to find the various pieces himself. He discovered that the Nexus fragments had housed themselves within human beings, one of which being Howard the Duck. Mahapralaya captured Howard and brought him into the Florida Everglades, the original site of the Nexus of All Realities. He believed that if he could destroy but one of the fragments, then the Nexus could never be restored, and thus his dreams of universal dissolution would come to fruition. However, the Man-Thing intervened, and intercepted the Nexus shard before Mahapralaya could acquire it. After which, the swamp creature turned his corrosive touch against the cult leader with unexpected results. Rather than burning Mahapralaya's face, The Man-Thing's powers, working in concert with the Nexus shard, actually healed his disease-ridden body, turning him into a normal person. Moments later, Mahapralaya staggers off into the swamp.[4]\nCult memberAndrew Forsonhad once worked with undercoverS.H.I.E.L.D.agentBobbi Morse. Creating a second personality in her, he used Morse to kill investigating S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, then to remove Victorius himself in order to take over the cult.[5]"

A cult formed in reverence towards that Inhuman, deeming it destined to rule the Earth, and managed to claim the Monolith used to banish it to a planet called Maveth. They used the symbol of a ram's skull as their insignia, which changed over time into a skull with tentacles.[1]Repeated attempts were made throughout the course of history to send people to the other side to either serve or rescue the entity, but no one who went in ever came out. Members of the society in England had built an underground machine in a 19th century castle that could resonate the necessary frequency to keep the Monolith open, but the technology proved unstable and broke down after a few minutes of continual use.[2]At some point, the cult carved five pieces from the Monolith.[1]\nHYDRA's legions\nIn the rise ofNazi Schutzstaffel, the brutalJohann Schmidtre-branded the cult Hydra and incorporated itself into the Nazi government as a division for both deep science and the investigation of the occult. WhileAdolf Hitlerhad always maintained an interest in both fields, Schmidt was obsessed with them, leading to his taking of the Super Soldier serum which transformed him into the Red Skull. No longer a champion of the Aryan image, Hitler had Schmidt quietly transferred elsewhere, under the illusion that he could continue his work in private and with better funding, but the façade did not convince Schmidt.\nWhen theTesseractcube was located by Hydra forces in the early years of World War II, Schmidt personally saw to it that the artifact would be used to it's full potential byDr. Arnim Zola. Zola's outlandish designs of robotic power armor, massive vehicles and energy weapons and armor could find a functional use thanks to the cube's power, and with the most advanced technology in the World, Hydra could begin to plan their conquest — a conquest that Nazi guards would soon find out, counted Berlin amongst it's targets.\nHydra's goals would be challenged by America's own super-soldier,Steven Rogers, better known as Captain America. Aided by his best friend,Buckyand the Howling Commandos, Rogers was able to begin a massive assault on Hydra forces across the Axis lines, destroying numerous bases and capturing Arnim Zola. Eventually, Captain America came face to face with Red Skull on a Tesseract-powered bomber, heading to America. When it became clear that Rogers was gaining the upper hand in the fight, the Red Skull attempted to use the power of the Tesseract with his bare hands. This only resulted in a beam of light which caused the Red Skull to disappear without a trace, and forcing Rogers to put the bomber down in the freezing waters below, freezing himself solid and causing the Tessseract to be lost to the seas for 70 years.[3]\nWhen Hydra scientists were recruited by America as part of their efforts to use their weapons genius, they were able to subtly subvert S.H.I.E.L.D. from the inside as it grew, manipulating gathered intelligence and recruiting various key S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives to be loyal to Hydra's ideology. While S.H.I.E.L.D. would publicly serve as a peacekeeping force, its Hydra cells also carried their secondary goal of creating a world that would eventually become so chaotic that the populace would willingly sacrifice their freedom for security that S.H.I.E.L.D. offered, thereby handing control over to Hydra.[4]\nHydra became a great secret power conducting clandestine operations during the Cold War from the 1960s until the 1980s, engineering events in theCuban Missile Crisis,the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and many more.\nWith the help ofS.H.I.E.L.D.resources, Arnim Zola created a computer system in which his mind was uploaded into as an artificially intelligent user interface. Zola's physical body died in 1972, his mind continued to exist digitally.[4]\nDuring the early 1980s, Hydra infiltrated the Soviet power infrastructures, establishing a secret laboratory in East Berlin. The laboratory was infiltrated byHank Pym, who used his size-changing suit to destroy it. He also destroyed the memory suppressing machine, freeing all the prisoners and defeating all the Hydra guards.[5]\nIn 1989,Alexander PiercegaveWerner Reinhardta secret pardon and a medical parole, and the new identity of \"Daniel Whitehall\", and made sure that there would be no more records after this.[6]\nIn 1991,Vasily Karpov, a Hydra mole in the Soviet Armed Forces, woke upWinter Soldierfrom his suspended animation, and sent him to retrieve the recreated Super Soldier Serum fromHoward Stark. Barnes killed Howard and his wife, Maria Stark, in a car accident onLong Island, and then returned to Karpov, successfully retrieving the serum. The scientists of Hydra, with the serum retrieved, used the serum to continue the Winter Soldier Program.[7]\nIn 2001, a Hydra faction underGideon Malickmasterminded Project Distant Star Pathfinder, sending a group of NASA astronauts through the Monolith to Maveth as a sacrifice to the exiled Inhuman.[1]\nUsing an algorithm created by Zola, Hydra could determine which people represented a threat to their new world order. It was planned to use S.H.I.E.L.D.'sProject Insightto use the network of three heavily-armedhelicarriersto eliminate all the 20 million people determined as threats to Hydra by the algorithm.\nHowever, S.H.I.E.L.D. directorNick Furydiscovered Hydra's influence over S.H.I.E.L.D., and with the help ofCaptain America,Black Widow,FalconandMaria Hill, managed to scuttle their plans and destroy the helicarriers before any innocent life was lost. Fury faked his death and went undercover to eliminate Hydra cells in Europe.[4]\nFury's actions forced Hydra operatives to launch a prearranged surprise coup. To this end, signals were broadcast on all S.H.I.E.L.D. channels with a message to step \"out of the shadows\" and \"into the light.\" Take over actions were launched at all major S.H.I.E.L.D. installations resulting in a scramble to assert control on both sides. While the Triskelion was wrecked in the battle over Washington, D.C., theHubfell briefly into the hands of Hydra before being claimed by loyal S.H.I.E.L.D operatives, and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s East African base and the Treehouse fell into the hands of Hydra.[8]Afterwards, Hydra agents were ousted from theCube.[9]\nTwo Hydra cells were known to remain active after the coup; one led byJohn Garrett, seeking to revive the organization'sProject Centipede, the other led byWolfgang von Strucker, whose cell had created two enhanced twins,a boy possessing super speedanda girl with telekinesisfrom experiments performed onLoki's Scepter.[4]Strucker's cell settled inSokovia, a Eastern European country in turmoil, and took advantage of the situation to cover their operations.[10]Garrett's cell was defeated byDirector Coulson's team before they could implant Centipede soldiers in U.S. military ranks. In the aftermath of Garrett's defeat, S.H.I.E.L.D. was reformed to fight Hydra.[11]\nAfter the defeat of Garrett, a new cell led byDaniel Whitehallbegan a campaign to recovera mysterious alien artifact.[12]Though the Diviner was stolen by athird party, Whitehall was able to acquire a petrified victim who came into contact with the Diviner and attempted to reverse-engineer it into a weapon, which he tested out on a wedding reception, the targets being the U.S. Navy's anti-Hydra taskforce, but the test was deemed a failure as most of the attendees survived.[13]\nAfter the escape of two S.H.I.E.L.D. moles within Hydra, Whitehall made his move to remove S.H.I.E.L.D. completely. He sent mercenaries led byMarcus Scarlottito attack the United Nations building duringGeneral Talbot'santi-S.H.I.E.L.D. speech, wearing S.H.I.E.L.D. fatigues and killing people with Splinter bombs. This had the effect of motivatingSenator Wardto propose a multi-national police force to hunt down S.H.I.E.L.D. Belgium foreign minister,Julien Beckers, secretly a Hydra agent, publicly voiced opposition against the senator to trick S.H.I.E.L.D. into thinking that they'd be safe in his borders so they could be lured out and killed. Though Scarlotti's team was able to kill six S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, they, along with Beckers, were apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. and turned over to Talbot. Subsequently, Senator Ward, having made a deal with Coulson, publicly defended S.H.I.E.L.D. and condemned Hydra.[14]\nLuckily for Whitehall, the Diviner was brought to him byCalvin Zabo, who revealed the Diviner's true purpose as a key to a hidden alien city. WhileGrant Wardrejoined Hydra, Hydra was also attempting to locate Raina to unlock the artifact's true power. Though Raina was rescued by S.H.I.E.L.D., Ward was able to track her down through the tracker in her leg, leading to four Hydra quinjets surrounding theBus, threatening to shoot them down if they did not hand over Raina. Ward not only took Raina, but alsoSkyeand a tablet containing the location of the alien city.[6][15]Whitehall then went to Puerto Rico, which stood atop the alien city, and began drilling right above the main temple where the Diviner was to be brought. In the resulting confrontation with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whitehall was killed by Coulson.[16]\nAt the biannual meeting attended by Hydra leaders,Doctor Listenacted a competition to see S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed, the winner gaining the dominant claim Whitehall's former position. Some time afterwards,Sunil Bakshi, Whitehall's right-hand man, escaped S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and made his way toOctavian Bloom's estate. Convinced that other leaders of Hydra wanted to eliminate them, he and Bloom contacted Doctor List, who assured them that he and Baron von Strucker were not involved in any attacks on them. Afraid that they could be the next target, Bakshi convinced Bloom to simply kill the other three leaders. This was a ruse concocted by S.H.I.E.L.D. to eliminate Hydra's leadership, as they invaded Bloom's estate and killed him while handing Bakshi over to Talbot.[17]\nList later began following up on Whitehall's research and became interested in superhumans, seeking to track them down and experiment on them. He began tracking incidents of quantum energy bursts, suspecting a superhumanteleporterwas at work. At the same time, he was joined by Bakshi, who had been freed and brainwashed by Grant Ward to help Coulson infiltrate Hydra, and sent to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to capture the teleporter. Though Bakshi did not succeed in his objective, he was able to captureDeathlokand anInhuman,Lincoln Campbell, for List's experimentation.[18]\nList moved his operation to Hydra's Arctic base to further his experiments, but this was attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D. attempting to recover the prisoners and destroy the facility. In the ensuing battle, all Hydra agents in the base were killed, but Dr. List escaped and eventually rejoined Baron von Strucker in Sokovia.[19]\nUnfortunately for Hydra, Coulson had discovered the location of thescepterfrom the Arctic base and passed the information toMaria Hill, who in turn informed theAvengers. They staged an assault on the base that saw the scepter recaptured and Strucker handed over to NATO. Strucker was later killed in his cell byUltron.[10]\nWith the heavy losses among its leadership, Hydra disintegrated, though a small remnant of Hydra fell under the control ofGrant Ward, who intended to use the manpower directly against Coulson and his team.[20]\nAnother faction of Hydra, led byMitchell Carson, attempted to purchase the Yellowjacket suit and Pym Particles fromDarren Cross, but to the interference ofAnt-Man, Carson only escaped with a vial of the reverse-engineered Pym Particles.[21]\nDuring the Inhuman Outbreak crisis, Ward began building up his Hydra faction in secret, desiring to organize it in a way similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. He recruitedWerner von Struckerto his cause and assigned him to spy on Dr.Andrew Garner,Melinda May'sex-husband.[2]WhenLance Hunterwas discovered to have infiltrated Hydra in an attempt to assassinate Ward, alongside May, Ward signaled Werner to assassinate Garner and demanded the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents back off. Hunter refused and only shot Ward in the shoulder as the Hydra leader managed to get away.[22]Unbeknownst to everyone, Garner was secretly an Inhuman called Lash, who killed Werner's cohorts and forcing the young man to flee. Knowing that Ward would kill him regardless of the complications with his mission, Werner fled to seek refuge with another Hydra faction leader,Gideon Malick. However, Malick later sold him out to Ward in exchange for a future favour. Ward sent this subordinates to kill Werner, but due to the intervention of S.H.I.E.L.D., they only rendered him comatose.[23]\nMalick's faction was secretly responsible for designing theAdvanced Threat Containment Unit, an organization created to capture and study Inhumans. While the ATCU were under the impression that they were going to cure Inhumans, Malick was spiriting them away to create an army for the exiled Inhuman of Hydra's legend. Among his captives wasAndrew Garner, who could turn into a monstrous Inhuman named Lash.[1]\nHowever, he designated Ward a threat and attempted to have him killed when he tried to find a specific von Strucker vault said to contain great power. When Ward found his way to the vault, Malick acknowledged him as a new head of Hydra and revealed Hydra's history to him. Ward and Malick agreed to work together to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. while figuring how they broughtsomeoneback through the Monolith.[1]\nWard later assassinatedRosalind Price, the ATCU's leader, before she could confront Malick on his plans for the Inhumans. As this set Coulson on a path of revenge to hunt down and kill Ward, Hydra abducted AgentsLeo FitzandJemma Simmonsand brought them to the castle in Gloucestershire to interrogate them on how to operate the Monolith, having brought five pieces that would recreate the portal. After getting the information, Ward was convinced by Malick to lead an expedition to Maveth, with Fitz as their guide.[24]\nWhile awaiting the portal's reopening, Hydra suffered some setbacks. Simmons had managed to escape and freed Lash, who killed the dozen Inhumans Malick had brought to the castle. S.H.I.E.L.D. subsequently captured the portal chamber."

The members of the New Men were animals evolved into humanoid form by theHigh Evolutionary, but some among them longed to be human. Miles Warren promised to make the members of the cult human and that they would one day follow him into the world of man. Miles Warren created a retrovirus based on DNA he claimed to have gotten from human volunteers that was able to convert these New Men into human form. The retrovirus worked only temporarily and soon turned the inoculated into walking corpses. Ben Reilly speculated this retrovirus may have been a precursor to the Jackal'sCarrion Virus. The Jackal left the New Men every year and returned every summer. One summer, he boasted of creating two perfect clones:oneofPeter Parkerand theotherofGwen Stacy. Jackal promised to transfer all of the New Men into the bodies of cloned humans.\nThe High Evolutionary wanted to break the New Men of their devotion to Miles Warren and eventually returned to subjugate them once more. It was at this point the cult was established. He kidnapped the Gwen Stacy clone and faked tests to show that she was not a clone grow in a lab but rather a college student named Joyce Delaney infected with a retrovirus to rewrite her DNA into that of Gwen Stacy's and that the same was true forAnthony Serbaand Spider-Man's clone. The High Evolutionary spun this tale for his people because he did not want his New Men to aspire to be clones as his viewed clones as counterproductive to evolution and he wanted the New Men to take pride in themselves as a race.\nCult"

Most of the Aboriginal gods dwell inAlchera, a realm bordering the \"Dream Dimension\" of the demonNightmarewithin the Dreamtime, the collective unconsciousness of all sentient beings in the universe. The Aboriginal gods are called different names by their human worshipers; for example, the god of creationBaiameis know as \"Bunjil\" by the Kulin, the \"Minawara\" by the Nambutji, \"Karora\" by the Gurra, and \"Wuragag\" by the Gunwinggu. Unlike many of their counterparts in other Earth-based pantheons, the Aboriginal gods are still actively invoked and worshiped on Earth by a handful of remote Aboriginal tribal groups.[1]\nThe Aboriginal gods' precise origin, like that of all Earth's pantheons, is shrouded in legend.  According to ancient myths, the godAltjiracould not depart the Dreamtime without losing his powers.  However, he directed the other Aboriginal gods to temporarily leave the Dreamtime and descend to the Australian continent within the Earth realm eons ago when the land was barren and featureless.  The gods then proceeded to shape the landscape according to Altjira's plan;Julunggul, the Rainbow Serpent, dug deep into subterranean waterholes and began to carve out gullies that became rivers; while Baiame gave form to the mountains and forests.  However, Marmoo, the god of evil, grew jealous of the newly created world and, believing that it was more difficult to destroy than to create, set out to prove his abilities by fashioning a tribe of insectoid warriors in his own grotesque image.  When Marmoo sent his insect swarms to ravage the landscape, the Earth MotherGaea(known to the Aboriginal gods as \"Dilga\" and \"Nungeena,\" among other names) wove flowers together and transformed them into a flock of lyrebirds that attacked and defeated the insect horde.\nOver one hundred millennia ago,Orphan- a sentient extraterrestrial device capable of telepathic communication and transforming dreams into reality - crash on Earth, in the Australian outback. An Aboriginal tribe eventually located it, and began venerating it, regarding it as their own link to the Dreamtime, thus reinforcing their belief in Altjira and his progeny.[1]\nThe Aboriginal Australians ofAustraliabegan worshiping the Aboriginal gods over 20,000 years ago,[2]\nAnother account mentions the Aboriginal peoples starting worshiping the Aboriginal gods from approximately 8000 BC. The Orphan was eventually located by an Aboriginal tribe who venerated it, regarding it as their own link to the Dreamtime, thus strengthening their belief in Altjira and his progeny.[1]\nAround that time, 10,000 years ago, Julunggul the Rainbow Serpent shed her skin. Altjira collected this skin, stretched it over the frame of night, and sealed it with the kiss of sleep to create a great vessel capable of sailing through the Dreamtime to any realm inhabited by gods, regardless of their shape or form.[1]\nThe worship in the Aboriginal gods didn't fade out in modern days, with a handful of remote Aboriginal tribal groups still actively invoking and worshiping them.[1]\nWhen theX-Men'sLongshotattempted to enter the Dreamtime, he was attacked and rendered unconscious by Altjira, who had left the Dreamtime - albeit without his full powers.[1]"

The Church targeted illegal immigrants inChinatown, offering them protection in exchange for their total devotion. The Church was also involved in taking control of downtown gangs, extortion and killing. A few months later, Tenfingers applied for federal recognition, in order to acquire legitimacy, tax-extempt and a legally protected front for his operations.[1]\nThe activities of the Church caught the attention of attorney-at-lawMatt Murdock, who began to investigate the Church both as an attorney and under his vigilante identity ofDaredevil. He managed to convinceBilly Lito testify against the Church in court. Even though some of the followers of the Church failed to kill Billy, who was saved by Daredevil,[2]they then attacked him in the detention level of the Supreme Court and convinced him to not testify, cutting of some of his fingers in the process. One of the members deployed to coerce Billy wasSam Chung, who was secretly the vigilante Blindspot and an ally of Daredevil.[1]"

Sodatha was itself possibly one of the Great Old Ones.[3]\nDue to Sodatha and the blood cult around it, the city fell from its status of commercial crossroad, and caravans passed by. The citizens of Hanghara cowered at night while the cult of Sodatha performed their unholy offices (in which goats and maidens were sacrificed to the monster) and the ground of the city opened as Sodatha  stretched its tentacles to devour people as well as rodents on the streets, night after night.\nCirca 10,000 BC,ConanandTrollo, captured after having tried to rob the city's coffers, escaped from their cages. As they flew away from the guards, entered a tunnel from which emerged tentacles. In it, they found emeralds, slew what could be the spawn of Sodatha, and instants later stumbled into a sacrificial ceremony. As Conan witnessed twogoatsbeing offered to the monsters, he rushed to save a sacrificial girl, the \"betrothed of Sodatha\", following them. Meanwhile, Trollo was confronted to more of the spawn. In his clumsy retreat, he enraged the monster by throwing braziers at it. In pain, the creature shook the very foundation of the city, setting it ablaze and in ruins, before dying with it.[1]"

The tutor owned an ancient-lookingStygianbook which Vardanes managed to look into one night, reading in it a referenced to the \"devil-hauntedAkhlatin theRed Waste, where power-mad sorcerers of yore called down a demon from beyond to their unending sorrow\".[1]\nHe eventually joined theZuagirsand became a blood brother toOlgerd Vladislav, leader of the Zuagirs. Olgerd was later overthrown byConan.[1]\nHe was bribed, with 200silver shekels, into an informant by theTuranianamirBoghra, who exploited Vardanes' hunger for vengeance over Conan. Vardanes had the Zuagirs set into a Turanian ambush, in a pass inShan-e-Sorkh, the Red Waste.\nWhen the column of riders entered the pass, Vardanes at his beginning spurred his horse to (possibly fearful of being deemed expendable by the Turanians, though Boghra Khan intended to keep his promise), and Boghra decided to start the attack, havingh his archers rain arrows over the Zuagirs. Boghra eventually had them stop, as the dust prevented from seeing much, and he thought continuing was just a waste of ammo. Using that respite, Conan rallied the horde of Zuagirs and defeating the Turanians.\nHaving a talk with the captured Boghra (whom he knew from his time in the Turanian military), Boghra interrogated him, but knew Vardanes was the traitor (as he had asked, unusual for him, to be the advance scout, and didn't make Boghra Khan betray him. Once Boghra was let to go, Conan and the Zuagirs were set on the trail of Vardanes.[1]\nVardanes kept on a straight path southwest, intoShan-e-Sorkh, fleeing the \"Death of five stakes\" demanded by theZuagirs' Codefor those who betray their camarades, and which Conan intended to apply, having swore byCromandMitrathat Vardanes would die, and ordering that none should rest until Vardanes did pay for his treason. As he enteredMakan-e-Mordan, the \"Place of Ghost\", the Zuagirs began to fear. Fearing that his comrades would turn against Conan to flee this place,GomerofAkkhariadrugged Conan, and the Zuagirs left without him.\nAfter five days of running away, the Zuagirs on his tale, Vardanes found himself forced to go on foot, as his horse couldn't support him anymore. Praying toIshtar,Set, Mitra and many other gods, he eventually found himself beforeAkhlat, whom he recollected from his youth. He was captured by the city guards, and forced into Akhlat the Accursed. Conan himself was saved and brought to Akhlat byEnosh, who thought Conan to be the liberator of an ancient prophecy, who would slay the evil goddess ruling over Akhlat."

As theZamoran kingsconspired against the city and chocked its trade. To maintain his lifestyle, Slogg began selling goat meat at the slaughterhouses, earning the ire of the Brotherhood who considered the goat to be the most sacred creature. Tension soon turned to bloodshed as Slogg hired more mercenaries and attacked the Brotherhood who burned down the slaughterhouses. A truce was achieved when Slogg accepted to stop selling goat meat. To seal the pact, Slogg was to marry Lissandra.[2]\nPeace was restored for years, and Lissandra gave Slogg a son. Though, eventually, famine struck Zamora and Slogg resorted to selling goat meat once again in order to cover his costs and maintain his lifestyle. Slogg consequently hiredConanto protect him. An attempt was made at Slogg's life in his sleep by assassins of the Brotherhood, easily thwarted by Conan, though he failed to pursue the second assailant in the garden, as he disappeared underground through a secret entrance. The next day, Conan looked for clues on the assassin's escape, but was distracted by the annoyance of Lissandra and failed to find it. As Lissandra went into town, Conan was tasked by Slogg to escort her in town, where he was ambushed by \"thieves\", easily dealt with.[2]\nDuring an another attempt, Lissandra and her father tried to steal the babe again, but his cries attracked Slogg and Conan. Lissandra promptly put the blame on the priest, whom Slogg quickly slayed. The following night, Lissandra tried to seduce Conan, and when he rejected her, accused him of having forced upon herself, causing Slogg to attack, which gave her time to sneak away with her son and a cultist who posed as a guard. This time, Conan was able to find the entrance from the gardens and into the sewers. The party closed on Lissandra, but her cultist fellow used the powers of his cult to animate an army of the dead.[2]\nWhile Conan and Slogg battled the undead, at the cost of all of Slogg's guards, Lissandra started the ritual to sacrifice the thousandth young, her own son. Conan and Slogg interrupted the ceremony. To prevent total failure, Lissandra made a cut her own chest to summon Delanzar forth. The apparition caused the worshipers to flee in terror. Delanzar immediately targeted Conan who managed to escape by shattering a tablet with theEldritch Symbol of Power, hurting Delanzar."

This was considered by the locals a small price to pay for peace with that dark and sinister god. Their minaret's dome was open, to allow the Night-God to enter his temple.[2]\nOne of the women offered as sacrifice was impregnated by the Bat-God, and gave birth to the bat-winged humanoid hybridNight-Goddess.\nWhile the priestess' father was away on a pilgrimage,[3]the Night-God was killed byConanand the priestessHajiiwas slain byJenna.[2]\nThe cult went on despite their god's death, but became theCrow Cult.

They presented themselves as theBastard Children of theAkah Ma'at, forced into hiding, and wishing to free Ma'kannta from his demonic realm prison, for him to protect them, and thus enabling them to reclaim the skies over Shadizar.[1]The exact nature of their relation to the Akah Ma'at, if it really exists, remains unrevealed.\nAs Conan and the time-displacedScarlet Witchtracked bandits who had stolen aNight Shard, a piece of theOlympiangoddessNyx's soul, those bandits were attacked by night-cultists and crows, who looted the Shard away.\nThey used the Night Shard, the \"Ebon Key\", for itseldritch powerto free Ma'kannta, through a girl's sacrifice. Though Conan prevented the girl's death, the Shard still cut her, and the blood spilled was enough to return Ma'kannta from its demonic realm prison.

She intervened, along with herChildren of the Nightseemingly killing Ma'kannta or return him to his realm.[1]The heroes, rejoined by otherAvengersthen battled Nyx and her ilk among the corpses of the Crow cultists.[4]\nWhen the priestess' father returned from pilgrimage, he found the temple destroyed, the order dissolved, and learned of his daughter's and his god's deaths.

During the next two years, the cult sacrificed a female upon the altar, and sometimes heard the flapping of wings, though no god ever came, as the Night-Goddess did not care for women. They purchased theLotusmany of their worshipers required for their visions fromYatha.\nTwo years later, their sacred assassins followed Conan after he slew Yatha and burned his warehouse.

HowardFirstConan the Barbarian#10(July, 1971)\nCorinthia is a mountainous realm of loosely allied city-states. A lesser kingdom, its major claim to fame was that, while theRoad of Kingstrade route passed through its countryside, it had never been one of its major stops.[3]\nCorinthia existed as a kingdom, contemporary to emergentAcheron.\nDue to the statement that theHyborian KingdomsofKoth,Ophir, and Corinthia \"regained their independence with thefall of the empire\" ofAcheron, a theory asserted that those three kingdoms may had not been founded by theHyborians(unlikely to have dominated those kingdoms at the dawn of Acheron), but by refugees fromValusia,Thurania, andZarfhaana, rebuilding their culture while the Hyborians were still in the Far North.[4]\nAt some point, Corinthia, as well asOphirandKoth, were satellites ofStygia.\nCorinthia was later annexed byAcheron.[5]\nWith theFall of Acheroncirca 13,000 BC, it regained its independence.[6]\nConanencountered a group of mourners for the death ofJonar, a well-loved local noble who wasted away his part of the family fortune. Conan andLady Radia, a noblewoman whom he spent some time with, found that Jonar managed to simulate his death and return from the crypt to kill his hated brotherBojjand take his place among the living, thus acquiring his fortune. The tomb he chose to be buried was however haunted by a degenerate race, the descendants of a strange alien race who was sealed up under the earth to perish by his distant forebears. The dwellers under the tombs killed both Jonar and Bojj, but Conan managed to save Radia and escape, locking the crypt again.[7]\nSome time later, Conan fought in the Corinthian meadowlands with the allied forces ofPoloponniandLonikaagainst the armies ofZhenkri of Athros, the Lion of Corinthia. After the battle was over,Prince Achmarsurrendered and was immediately slain by Zhenkri, while the Cimmerian was held prisoner. Approaching Poloponni, he managed to escape with the prince's twin sister,Kassa, and reach the city-state.[8]\nKing Aechidesruled over Corinthia until he was murdered byCaliastros. Aechides' wife and queen escaped along with her child, and Caliastros set as his goal to find and destroy them both.[9][10]\nMuch of the local population practices farming and herding, and are effectively self-sufficient. The cities are local centers of industry, developing wool clothes and hand-crafted musical instruments. There is a significant contrast between the pastoral paradise of its countryside, and the crime-infested back alleys of certain city-states. Rogues, brawlers, and \"loose women\" frequent and control such city districts.[3]"

Khitai itself became synonymous with ancient knowledge and lore.[1]\nThe Khitans themselves were convinced of their cultural superiority and attempted to isolate themselves from the western \"barbarians,\" by which they meant any foreigner. The terrain of their area favored them, as to the west of Khitai lay the vastWuhuan Desert. Few travelers would risk crossing the desert and facing its nomadic tribes. Still the Khitans constructed aGreat Wallas further protection from potential invaders.[1][verification needed]\nThe people,[10][1]traditions and civilization of Khitai came from thePre-Cataclysmic times.[1]\nKhitai entered at some point a conflict known inTuranas the \"Great War with Khitai\".

Howard,Roy Thomas,Barry SmithFirstConan the Barbarian#1(July, 1970)\nAquilonia is the \"Mightiest kingdom of the West\" in theHyborian Lands. It is one of the so-calledHyborian Kingdoms, realms created by the Hyborian tribes which once invaded the area ofHyboriafrom the frozen north.\nBy 13,000 BC, at its high point,Acheronwas bordered at the northwest by theAquiloni,[3]one of theHyboritribes.\n\"Aquilonian Acheron\" fell to the invadingHyborisome time after \"NemedianAcheron.\"[4]\nAquilonia was one of the nations to rose on the ashes ofAcheron,[5]after itsFallcirca 13,000 BC.\nKing Andromeduswas one of Aquilonia's earliest kings, or its first, who turned Aquilonia from a wilderness and wasteland, and made it a might empire, carved from nothing, and was considered the founder of the Aquilonia.[6]The exact role of Andromedus in history, whether the very first king of Aquilonia, or the first to make it a mighty empire, remains unrevealed.It is possible that Andromedus participated in theFall of Acheron, circa 13,000 BC, or came in the years following it, in the earlyHyborian Age.\nDuring Andromedus' rule, strange deaths, monsters, devil cults plagued the near south ofTarantia. With a small troop, Andromedus ventured southwards winto the mountains along theKhorotas Riverand near the heart of Aquilonia, where he was slain by the sorcererXondar Kan, who then used his soul as a source of power, feeding him thePale Ones(descendants of Andromedus' soldiers and abducted hillwomen) to increase the power of the Undead One, the twisted soul of Andromedus.[6]\nCirca 10,900 BC (nine hundred years before theAge of Conan),Epeus the Sword-Wielderwas king of Aquilonia.[7]Around that time,Nemedia, then ruled byKing Bragorusinvaded Aquilonia but was driven back.[7][8]\nAquilonia vassalized the kingdom ofGunderlandat north, who allowed it for expediency.[9]\nKing Vilerus Ihad a great bridge to be built up upon theRiver Khorotas.[10]\nIt is unclear which King Vilerus was involved in this event:King VilerusandPoitainwent at war, leading to a Poitainian invasion of the central provinces. That event cause a resentment from the central provinces' people towards Poitain.[11]\nDuringKing Pharineus' rule, gold coin were rather made of brass.[12]\nAbout twenty-five years before the ascension, Aquilonia entered an era of expansionism and imperialism, attempting to extent intoCimmeriaandPictland. This was possibly during the rule ofKing Vilerus.[13]\nVilerus IIIwas succeeded by his nephewNumedides.[14][15]\nDuring the lifetime ofConan, the privileges of the nobility created a shortage of farmland. The nobles used the right to claim otherwise fertile land as part of their private hunting grounds. In combination with the rising population of the country, this trend left many peasants with no land to tend to. This led in turn to ongoing efforts of the state towards western expansion and colonization ofPictland. Unsurprisingly, thePictsrepeatedly attempted to drive settlers away and reclaim their hereditary lands. Making border wars recurring events.[16]\nConan theCimmerianclaimed the throne for himself during a civil war. His queen consortZenobiawas a Nemedian. Their children included the heirPrince Conn, Princess Radebund, and Prince Taurus. Publius served as Conan's chief councilor, Trocero, Count of Poitain as seneschal, Prospero of Poitain as de facto right-hand-man, Alcemides as the court philosopher, Dexitheus as High Priest, and Pallantides as commander of the Black Dragons.[16]\nAfter 20 years of reign, Conan abdicated in favor of his sonConan II (Conn).[4]\n...[17][16]\nCirca 9,500 BC, When it was at its zenith, Aquilonia annexedZingara,Argos,Ophir, westernShem,[4]Corinthia, andZamora, which they treated with as subjected countries. Similarly, theBossoniansand other less powerful peoples were treated with growing contempt.Kothwas practically tributary.Stygia, thenBrythuniawere defeated in battle.\nThePictsstarted going and coming in Aquilonia, aided by theNemedianpriest ofMitraAruswho also helped the Pict chieftainGormhow to mine and work iron into weapons. Many Picts joined the Aquilonian troops as mercenary, learning about civilized warfare before returning. Meanwhile, Gorm became chief of chief, and then moved his armies to war against Aquilonia. The invasion was halted by the Bossonians.\nAs powerfulNemediawas still free, the Aquilonian armies, mostly comprised of mercenaries and Bossonians, marched on the neighbor. This eastern war caused theBossonian Marchesto be lightly guarded. Once word of the Pictish's attacks on Bossonia, whole regiments of Bossonians left the campaign and return home where they defeated the Picts. That desertion was however the direct cause of the Aquilonians' defeat by the desperate Nemedians.\nIn retaliation, Aquilonia positioned regiments on the borders of the Marches. The Bossonian chiefs were lured into their encampment and massacred. The Aquilonians then attacked the people, ravaged the land and marched back from the borders.[1]\nWithout the Bossonians' resistance, Gorm (who was now an old man with his ambition intact) had his Picts swarm into Aquilonia's itself.\nZingara, Corinthia and the Shemites seized the opportunity to free themselves from Aquilonian rule. Whole regiments of mercenaries and vassals mutinied, marching back to their countries, looting and burning on the way. In addition to the Picts and the mercenaries' ravages, the Cimmerians invaded the land as well. The sum caused the destruction,[1]mostly attributed to both internal decay and the massive Pict invasion.[4]The Picts made themselves master of Aquilonia and massacred nearly all the inhabitants in the process.\nA short age later,Gunderlandwas destroying by the Cimmerians fleeing from the north.[18]\nAquilonia had an advanced economy for its era, aided by the fertility of its land and by trade through the so-called Road of Kings. The latter being the main east-west trade route of the Hyborian Age. The profits from commerce have allowed the country to maintain one of the largest and better-organized military forces in the known world. It is often viewed as an empire instead of a kingdom. The imperial troops are known as the Black Legions due to the color of their armor. The personal guard of the king forms an elite unit, known as the Black Dragons.[16]\nThe Aquilonians used at leastAquilonian Gold Crowns,[19]Aquilonian Cesterces(under the form of coins),[20]andAquilonian Silver Talents[21](atalentbeing a measure).\nThe capital city wasTarantia. Aquilonia included several provinces and regions of diverse culture and historical background.Attalusin the southeast was one of its major commercial centers and a stronghold of the aristocracy.Poitainin the far south was a fertile land of meadow lands and plains.Gunderlandto the far north is a woodland with a climate similar to its neighbor,Cimmeria. TheBossonian marchesin the west used to be the traditional border area, and long wars with the Picts left their cultural marks. TheWestermarckwas by theAge of Conana recently-settled western frontier and unstable due to frequent conflicts with the native population.\nThe Gundermen maintained a regional identity and have kept some primitive elements of Hyborian culture. Their warrior culture made them outstanding soldiers. Gundermen pikemen and spearmen form the backbone of the Aquilonian army, and served in mercenary forces across the Hyborian world. The Bossonians trained their lads to become master archers. The mainstream Aquilonians either served in the country's strong infantry or in its heavily-armed cavalry.[16]\nInitially the Aquilonians worshiped the ancestral god of the Hyborians,Bori (or Borri). By the time ofConan, they were instead monotheistic worshippers ofMitra.[16]\nThe regions of Aquilonia during theHyborian Age of Conan"

Divided into various tribal clans and led by individual leaders called khans, their warfare consisted of recurring raids and relied upon skilled usage of barbed arrows.\nOther Hyrkanians settled down and established their own city-states and ports. Cities such asMakkaletwere \"oases of civilization\" in an otherwise barbaric region; however, at the time ofConan, these cities were the targets of a neighboring empire expanding itself to all directions:Turan.\nThe major deities of the area wereErlikandTarim. They were worshiped by both nomads and city-dwellers.[8]\nThe Hyrkanian language include demi-vowels.[9]"

As a child, she was educated by the shamanN'Yagawho had fled theSouthern Islesand become an advisor to the King. When Atrahasis was assassinated byStygiansoldiers allied to his brotherNim-Karrakwho planned to usurp the throne, Bêlit was taken away by N'Yaga.[1]\nThey ended up in his old home on theSouthern Isleswhere they were adopted by a tribe ofBird-Riderswhom N'Yaga led to believe that she was the daughter of the death-goddessDerketa. Bêlit beame a fierce warrior and when she came of age, she took control of the tribe.[1]\nShe turned her tribesmen into notorious pirates, calling herself theQueen of the Black Coast.[9]\nShe metConanwhen her pirates raided anArgosseanship which he had boarded. Bêlit was impressed with him and had Conan duel one of her officers,Odongo. After he won, Conan joined her crew and the two began a romantic relationship.[9]\nWhile collecting tribute from theWatambi tribe, Bêlit was kidnapped by theDragon Riderswho were at war with the Watambi.[10]She freed herself and ran into the wild man calling himself Amra the Lion,[11]who planned to marry her.[12]She was freed by Conan who slew Amra in a duel.[13]\n...\nAfter refusing the crown, Bêlit resumed her piracy activities,[14]but was troubled dreams aboutgiant towersfull of treasures, up theZarkheba.[15]\nAfter boarding a Stygian ship, Bêlit and Conan found aivory-skinned girlwhich they took with them before heading towards the Silver Isles for supplies and crew replacements. Despite Bêlit's hostility for the girl, suspected to be from the southern ice land, Conan noticed her necklace's non-Stygian gems, and convinced Bêlit that the girl could lead them to new riches.\nAt the Silver Islands, they were attacked by the Bird-Riders, led byGhomli, who rejected Bêlit's divinity and queenship. Conan assaulted Ghomli, resulting a duel between Ghomli and Bêlit's champion. Conan was defeated and apparently killed, and Ghomli took Bêlit as his mate as a symbol of his kingship.[14]N'Yaga in fact had drugged Conan with an herb giving him the semblance of death. Despite Bêlit's opposition, N'Yaga informed Ghomli of their theory on the snow-skinned girl and the riches that lied in the southern Frozen Land.\nBuried alive, Conan awoke and broke Bêlit, N'Yaga, the girl, and the Black Corsairs out of Ghomli's grasp. They sailed southwards to escape Ghomli and find gems to sell in order to assemble a fleet and annihilate him. Ghomli pursed them aboard the Stygian ship captured some time before. The girl, christened \"Tekeli-Li\" because she kept repeating it while attempting suicide rather than go home, learned their language and resigned, helping them in their course. Bêlit's jealousy towards her was eased by Conan. After days of sailing, they finally reached the Frozen Land, where they hid. For days, they walked towardsLeng, and finally reached theMountains of Madness. Despite \"Tekeli-Li\"'s terrified protest, Bêlit insisted to enter the Mountain, where the group was soon surrounded by a party of snow-skinned warriors. Bêlit wanted to battle but Conan had them surrender, in order to be able to find the gems.[16]\nTaken prisoners, they witnessed carvings of the life and fall of theOld Ones. \"Tekeli-Li\" was revealed to be named Ta-No, daughter of theSnow Queen, who ordered them to be executed, though Ta-No had Conan spared, wishing him to be her mate. Free, Conan returned to save his companions, just as Ghomli and his warriors attacked the place, killing the queen. Fleeing the scene, they witnessed more carvings, and even found the frozen corpse Old One and piles of gems. Ghomli's warriors rejoined them in a short-lived fight, as aShoggotharrived. Conan caused a cave-in to stop it, and both parties exited the mountain. Ta-No rushed at Ghomli to avenge her mother, and fell, soon joined by her murderer, thrown down by Conan.\nBêlit felt sorry for Ta-No and her own actions of late. Before heading back to re-supply, Bêlit decided to sail towards the Zarkheba to finally investigate the towers of her dreams.[15]\n...[17]\nBêlit (or Valeria?)"

Howard,Roy Thomas,Barry Windsor-SmithFirstConan the Barbarian#1(July, 1970)\nStygiawas an ancient land of sorcery and serpent worship, located in theSouthern KingdomsbetweenShemand theBlack Kingdomson the world-continent ofHyboria. It was a theocracy and openly xenophobic. The ancestors of the Stygians conquered the land after driving out an ancient \"Elder Race,\" probably theSerpent-Men. They consequently inherited pre-human monuments, such as theblack pyramidsand the religious worship ofSet.[1]\nDuring thePre-Cataclysmic Age, theSerpent-Folkruled over Stygia,[6]and built theblack pyramidsand the tombs bellow them.[1]\nAccording to legend, ten thousand years before theAge of Conan(which would set it circa 20,000 BC, during thePre-Cataclysmic Ageand about 1,500 years before theAge of Kull,see notes),Akivashawas an evil and beautiful princess reveled in \"purple feasts\" in the black halls ofLuxur. She became avampireat some point.[7]\nThe ancestors of the human Stygians destroyed much of the snake-folk when they conquered Stygia, before ironically coming to worship them, deriving in a worship ofSet.[1]\nCirca 16,000 BC,[8]or circa 15,500 BC,[9][10]thousand years after theGreat Cataclysm. the ancient kingdom ofAcheronwas founded by Stygians fromKhemi, who established an outpost at the embouchure of theTyborand expanded up-river, while enslaving or destroying the small unclassified tribes it encountered.[9]Acheron soon broke off Stygian control, though it remained Stygian in culture.[9]\nWesternKoth,Ophir, andCorinthiawere at some point under Stygia's dominion, but apparently fell to Acheron at a later date.[11]\nAs war approached between Acheron, Stygia, andZamora(the pre-CataclysmicZhemri, re-invigorated by infusions of some unclassified race), theHyborians, unable to penetrate Acheron's and Zamora's borders, were led to Stygia with Acheron's connivance and Zamora's secret help, resulting in the loss of the Stygian forts in northernShem. The Hyborians subsequently settled in tribal clusters between Acheron and Zamora.[9]\nThun'da of the Snow-Manefighting the Sygian horde\nAt some point circa 13,000 BC, according to legends, the Stygians marched on Acheron. In Koth, Acheron's fiercest warriorThun'da of the Snow-Mane, wielder of theScarlet Sword, fought a horde of Stygians, but was eventually defeated and slain, and his family massacred.[12]\nThugra Khotan, the arch-mage of Acheron, preferred to retreat in the Stygian city ofKuthchemesto avoid being forced to choose sides, as Stygia's king remained strictly neutral to Acheron and its enemies alike.[13]\nFinally, Old Stygia joined the conflict on Acheron's side, but too late to turn the tide and prevent theFall of Acheron. In retaliation, the infuriatedKothianssacked Kuthchemes.[9]The Hyborians invaded the city, slaughtered Thugra Khotan's devotees, but were unable to breach into hisIvory Dome, and consequently fled the ruined city.[14]\nBy the end of the conflict, the Stygians were pushed back beyond theStyxand out ofShem.[9]\nAt some point, theYezmite cultwas powerful in Stygia, and hadLuxurunder its thrall.[15]\nThe following events are repeatedly stated to be set several centuries before theAge of Conan, and can be presumed to occur during theHyborian Age, rather than during theAge of Acheron.\nSeveral hundred years before theAge of Conan, the King boasted he would cross theRiver Styxon his chariot, and set out the construction of a bridge over the river. When after five years of construction, he bridge was swept away by rising waters, the king had the priests ofSetflogged, and extinguished the sacred fire of theTemple of Sethimself (rumors alleged he had a ceremony where corpses of ibises, most abhorrent creatures to Set, were burned. The high priestKha Semblorrallied thenobles, and together led a mob to the palace. The King refused to hear his sisterNitocris' plea to light the temple fires and met with the mob. For an instant, his magnificient defiance neutered the mob, but as a miracle, a step broke loose from under the King who stumbled and fell down the stairs and the reignited mob tore his body apart, avenging Set.[16]\nThe next week, Nitocris, with the blessing of the priests of Set and acceptance of the people, was declared queen, but secretly plotted vengeance. She had anew temple to Setbuilt, \"to atone for her brother's sacrilege\", and held a banquet for all the nobles and high priests in the subterranean vault of the temple, where she trapped them all alive, before enabling a mechanism to drown them with he water of the Styx. Returning to Luxur, Nitocris knew the people would suspect her hand in the death of the nobles and priests, who all had participated to her brother's slaying, and committed suicide before the angry mob entered her palace boudoir.[16]\nArgosand Stygia went at war.Kothbecame embroiled in the conflict, and the Kothians urged that both them and Argos launch a simultaneous invasion of Stygia. Argos consequently raised an army of mercenaries (includingAmalricofAquiloniaandConanofCimmeria).[17]Zapayo da Kova was the admiral of the invading fleet assembled byArgosto attack Stygia.ThePhoenix, carried a cargo of gold to pay the troops, but was lost from the fleet in a storm, somewhere south of theIsle of the Black Ones.[18]\nZapayo's fleet met theStygian Fleet, defeated it and drove it back intoKhemi. Instead of landing, looting the city and advancing along theRiver Styx, Zapayo cautiously cruised the fleet southward to the coasts ofKush. The ships anchored and the army pushed eastwards along the Stygian frontier, burning and pillaging on his course. The plan was to turn northward to strike the heart of Stygia and join with the Kothic army pushing southward, but Koth concluded a separate peace with Stygia, and theStygian Armywas free to annihilate Argos' mercenary army.[17]\nFew of the mercenary host survived, including Conan and Amalric.[17]ThePhoenix-Trovebecame as fabled as theTalons of Dagonor theTreasure of Tranicos.[18]\nDuring the rule ofKing Mentupherra,Thoth-Amonwas forced to flee in exile.[19]\nAfterKing Mentupherra's death,Ctesphon IVbecame king of Stygia.\nThough Thoth-Amon stayed away for a time, but was eventually forced to flee again and return in stealth to Stygia during the rule of Ctesphon IV. Finding favor and gathering wealth and magical might, Thoth-Amon eventually made himself the virtual ruler of Stygia.[19]\nHe was seemingly a bad king, gambling away fortunes on dwarf fights, a sport considered gruesome and obscene by his wife, as did his former wives before her.\nFor those excesses, but also because he wished to diminished the power of the priesthood in the affairs of state, the priest elite wished to remove and replace him. The Stygian sorcererParmek Da'anschemed as well to overthrow him and usurp the Stygian throne.Kiriandra the Enchantress, a former student of Parmek, forcedConanto go and stop Parmek, and gave him a talisman protecting him from Parmek'sastral form.\nDuring a venture on the streets of Luxor, Mehtvezem was targeted by assassins sent by the priests, but was saved by Conan. Conan later invited himself in Mehtvezem's quarters and managed to get recruited into theRoyal Stygian Elite Guard(after defeating the guard he was to replace).\nParmek Da'an and the priests joined forces, and Parmek Da'an presented him his trio of fighting dwarves. Infiltrated on the pretense of demonstrating his fighting dwarves (in fact aJinnof the Thirteenth Order), he possessed the vizier to fake an assassination attempt, have the vizier removed. He then possessed Mrhtvezem's queen to pretend adultery with Conan, thus removing him as well. Parmek then presented his dwarves, who merged into a single warrior who disposed of the king's guards.\nMrhtvezem was possessed by Parmek Da'an, who used his figure to lead the royal guards to slaughter his last potential rivals, the priesthood. Freed by the Queen, Conan confronted \"the King\" and his Jinn. Conan defeated the Jinn and forced Parmek to retreat. Parmek was unable to possess Conan who was protected by the talisman given by Kiriandra, thus fled to his body whom Conan was stabbed. Parmek subsequently withered.[20]\nWhileKing Yllarephwas disabled, his wife, the decadentQueen Sullimma, reigned in his stead, and plotted the return ofelder godYog Sothoth, which eventually led to her downfall.[21]Yiraleph's fate following his wife's demise is unrevealed.\nFor a time, Stygia was ruled by a king,Great Am-Hotep. When Am-Hotep died, he was embalmed and sat upon a black obsidian throne, while the priests ofSetcollected grain and wealthes to allegedly feed Am-Hotep's soul, and sacrificed those who you could not give anything.[22]\nCirca 9,500 BC, before thepost-Hyborian Cataclysm,Vaniradventurers came to Stygia, where they overthrew the ruling class building a vast southern empire which they calledEgypt. The early Pharaohs boasted to descend from them.[23]TheEgyptian godSethusurped and supplanted Set's worship only by the time Stygia becameEgypt.[24]\nAt the end of theHyborian Age, acataclysmcaused the formation of theMediterranean Seaalong the former westward path of theNilus, as theStygian continentbroke away from the rest of world-continent ofHyboriaand would later become the eastern part ofAfrica.[23]\nThe regions of Stygia\nStygian royalty and certain lines of ancient nobility were typically relatively tall people with fair-skinned and black hair. The rest of the nobility and the influential middle class are typically dusky-skinned and hawk-faced. The lower classes and the slaves typically have mixed ancestry, resulting from mating amongStygiansthemselves,Kushites,Shemites, andHyborians.\nStygia was underpopulated due to its climatic conditions. The only fertile lands were those surrounding theRiver Styx, also known as theNilus, while the rest of Stygia was an arid desert. Rumors of theHyborian Agesurmised that this was a side-effect of the Stygians practice ofdark magic.[1]\nStygian law punished piracy in Stygian waters by death in the bowels ofSet(or, in the case of theOrder of the Serpent, of the \"living godSet\").[25]\nThe sizable number of Stygian magic users and healers required constant production of medicinal drugs, and magical paraphernalia, making these major industries for the country. Stygia exported silks, and served as an important stop in trade networks involving animal hides, artwork, woven carpets, ivory, jade, pearls, and slaves.\nThe coastal city ofKhemiserved as its main harbour and religious center. It lacked the cosmopolitan culture of other major ports of the Hyborian world, mainly due to the restrictions imposed on foreign visitors. Only foreign ambassadors and licensed traders were allowed within the city. Foreign scholars and sorcerers tended to migrate to more hospitable Stygian cities.[1]\nThe city ofLuxurserved as the royal seat of power and center of administration. It aws strategically situated among major trade routes.Kheshatta, the famed City of Magicians, serves as another seat of power.\nStygia maintained a moderately-sized war fleet and a much larger land army. While this army had a well-deserved reputation for ruthlessness and discipline, it was hindered by the government's reluctance to upgrade their weaponry. Adhering to ancient tradition, they used the same type of armor and weaponry which their predecessors had used centuries before. Weapons that were considerably outdated in comparison to other Hyborian equipment.\nStygia was relatively secure from foreign invasion. TheEastern Desertand the steppes kept them safe from would-be eastern invaders, while their western border was theWestern Ocean. The Black Kingdoms and Shem also served as buffer zones, separating them from more aggressive potential opponents, but the Stygian government remained insecure and near-paranoid in its fear of foreign invasion.[1]\nThe worship ofSetwas the sanctioned state religion.[1]TheEgyptian godSethusurped and supplanted Seth's worship only by the time Stygia becameEgypt.[26]\nYog Sothoth, or Sehdoula, was worshipped byQueen Sullimma. TheFingers of Sehdoula, in theValley of Sehdoula, were a landmark in Stygia named after Sehdoula's outstretched hand, and a place from where Yog Sothoth could be summoned back on Earth when the stars were in proper position, opening the gates ofchaos.[21]\nOther Stygians deities included:\nOther, non-Stygian, deities sometimes invoked (whether as mere expressions or proper invocations) includedTarim,Ishtar,Mitra, and possiblyAshtoreth.[5]\nEarth-83600's Stygia\nBy theAge of Conan, circa 10,000 BC, Stygians still established colonies:\nThe empire of Stygia before the rise andfallofAcheronwas later known as \"Old Stygia\", and included cities and lands beyond the borders of Stygia during theAge of Conan\nFor a more complete list, please consult the full list ofStygians.\nMany monsters roamed Stygia, including:"

An ancient race, they were known during theAge of Conan, circa 10,000 BC, as \"maniacal religious cutthroats\", honored by dealing and receiving death.[1]They had several outposts throughout their lands, includingThe Gate, a city built around a wondrous garden.[3]\nThe Ghamud were an ancient race.[2]They erected cities of distinguishable design, in ruins by theAge of Conan.[1]\nAfter fleeingKoth, andEmperor Strabonus' wrath,Conancrossed theEastern Desertheading forTuranorHyrkania, knowing he would eventually encounter the Ghamud.[1]\nResting at Ghamud ruins during a sandstorm, he was soon caught up by Ghamud. He managed to slay all but one, who found refuge in an abandoned temple beneath the ruins, uncovered by the storm[1]and the twin of another lost structure he had explored once in theEiglophian Mountainsduring his youth. He decided to pursue, intending to slay the Ghamud survivor, and perhaps take revenge on the strange creatures he had encountered in that other temple and loot a treasure comparable in size. The Ghamud survivor was gravely wounded by the Predator, strange creatures guarding the temple, was eventually caught up by Conan. A mere boy, he repeatedly demanded Conan to finish him and bring him an honorable death, which Conan refused and left looking for the treasure room. As Conan was run out of it, the wounded Ghamud tried to slay him. Conan stated to him that he had violated the warrior's way bu trying twide to kill him through dishonorable means, before leaving him to rot there. The Ghamud was devoured only a moment later by one of the creatures.[2]\nConan later infiltrated another Ghamud-guarded city, which was a Ghamud outpost known asThe Gate, for water, slaying many Ghamud. Finding a wondrous garden, he was trapped within by a priest who thanked him for the honorable deaths of his brethren, and asked him to slay their death godArisnaub, who lived in a form not his own and that Conan would be reluctant to kill.[3]\nThe Ghamud of the Gate were later slaughtered by theTuraniansunderAchlemedes' orders, in order to replace them and set a trap for Conan and hisKozakiallies. Once Conan captured and shackled in the same tower the Ghamud's corpses were hidden, where he was left to be feasted upon by the carrion, the Turanians departed, fearing the Ghamud would show up in force at any time. Without Ghamud eunuchs to clear the sand after every major sandstorm, the structure of the temple broke under the weight, brutally freeing Conan as the roof collapsed, then the floor beneath him.[4]\nThe Ghamud were said to be an ancient people,[2]and were described as \"small, loud and emotional\".[3]\nThe Ghamud erected cities of distinguishable design, in ruins by theAge of Conan.[1]\nThe Ghamud possessed their own language.[2]They also swore oaths in another tongue.[1]\nThey also used the Kushite language when speaking to each other,[1]and spoke the language of theWestern Kingdoms.[2]\nThe Ghamud were fanatical worshipers ofdeath.[3]Their high calling was to kill, and being killed themselves was a great honor. Thus, the Ghamud found glory in victory and defeat alike.[1][2]\nThe Ghamud underwent many tests and rites of passage, and were considered adults while still boys, conditioning them by perverse means to follow their people's customs.[2]\nThey also mentionedArallu,[2]though it might be the result of translation.\nThe Ghamud counted eunuchs in their ranks, seemingly in charge of menial tasks.[4]\nThe Ghamud invoked the nameMjhada.[1]\nThe temple beneath Ghamud ruins, twin of a temple in theEiglophian Mountains, was seemingly not of Ghamud origin, as they described its god as a \"nameless god\". They knew the strange creatures guarding those as \"The Predator\".[2]\nThey disdained the gods of the \"weak-willedWest\", including those of the Northlands.[2]\nFor foreigners, \"infidels\", to enter their territory was considered a transgression of their holy lands, an offense punishable by death.[1]\nDespite all of their disdain, they had some respect for foreigners following the warrior's way.[2]\nLike other desert folks, the Ghamud wore turbans and ample clothes.[1][2]"

Howard,Roy Thomas,John BuscemaFirstSavage Sword of Conan#15(August, 1976)During theAge of Conancirca 10,000 BC, the Yuetshi were a tribe and people that lived in villages in theAkrim Valley, southeast of theVilayet Sea.[2]Those villages includedDjerda.[8]\nIn the past, the Yuetshi were the victims of vampire-likeBrylukason thecontinent,[5]and of the eldritch godKhosatral Khelon theislandandcity of Dagonia, in the Vilayet.[1]\nThe Yuetshi were among the peoples (along with theXuthalans, and theXuchotlans) that migrated from central orfar east, presumably pushed westward by theEast-folk.[9]\nThe ancestors of the Yuetshi were preyed upon by an ancient, not human, people, theBrylukas, until a priest of the Yuetshi cast a great spell that confined them to the tombs of their city which was connected by a stairway and tunnel toAkrim Valley, where the Yuetshi lived.[5]\nA brutish people, they stormed the shore of theislandandcity of Dagonia, but were defeated by Dagonia's god and rulerKhosatral Khel's sorcery. Enslaved, they served as sacrifices at the altars for nearly a generation.\nOne day, the Yuetshi priest left to far valley and returned. Upon his return, the Yuetshi slaves revolted as the priest wieldedd a knife forged of a meteor, before which Khosatral Khel's magic was ineffective. The priest defeated Khosatral Khel but did not slew him, instead laying the mystic knife across Khel's chest, rendering hul senless and unmoving. Thus, the priest could hold the threat of reviving him to ensure his own subjects' loyalty.\nOver the ages, Dagonia declined and eventually fell into ruin.[1]The Yuetshi had seemingly fled the city by then.\nAt some point,Maheevawas imprisoned within his fortress by a Yuetshi's socerer's dark malediction.[7]\nYears later, circa 10,000 BC, a Yuetshi fisherman went onXapur the Fortified(as was now known Dagonia), and removed the knife from Khosatral Khel's chest, breaking the spell. The god killed the fisherman, then restored his city and its inhabitants using necromancy.[1]\nLater, the blondeZarmistyled herself as a messiah and created an alliance of rebels involvingAfghulis,Irakzai, Yuetshi,Zuagirs, and other tribes (nearly a score of tribes in total) under her lead and againstTuran, attacking a Turanian outpost on the southern shore of the Vilayet and slaughtering its garrison. In reaction,King YezdigerdorderedGeneral Orne'qto assemble troops for theTuranian armyfrom Turan's carceral population. Orbe'q came to know (possibly through intel leaked on purpose) that the rebels had set camp in the valley east of theRmyra Pass.Captain Numallahwas ordered to go through the Pass with a battalion, despite his protest, given it was an obvious ambush spot. The rebels slaughtered half of the battalion, and Orbe'q put the blame on Numallah who was executed.[3]\nThe Yuetshi were short people, with long arms, yellowish skin, and flat, slant-eyed faces.[2]"

Failing in invadingCimmeria, Acheron nevertheless, brought Cimmerian youths to the capital ofPythonto serve as theKing's Elite Guard.\nAfterXaltana, witch-queen of Acheron, tried to supplant the worship ofSet, the Serpent-God, by the one of aDemon God, and was possessed by it,[8]the wizardKheperumaneuvered and had her entombed on the possession pretense.King Bafomaisucceeded her. Bafomai and Kheperu then intended to slay Xaltana's brotherXaltotun, the high priest ofSet, while the other archmage of Acheron,Thugra Khotanfled to the Stygian-ruled city ofKuthchemesrather than having to choose sides. In this state of things, Acheron was on the verge of civil war, with its rulers relying on arena captives-fighting games and sacrifices to keep the population entertained and in check.[5]\nThe war of the Hyborians upon the Acheronians was motivated by the years of Acheron preying upon their people.[6][5]\nEventually, profiting from Acheron's infighting,Kothmanaged to gain independence from Acheron, andKhossus V, King of Koth, formed agrand alliancealong with secedingOphir, the Hybori tribes, and all enemies of Acheron, seemingly including Shemites and the riders of Zingg,[5]to go at war with their oppressor.[9]\nCirca 13,000 BC, theHyborianbarbarians attacked and ravaged Acheron.[6]\nTheKing of Stygiadecided to remain neutral in the conflict, punishing this way the former colony.\nThe Hyborians, including the Kothians, Ophireans,Corinthi,Brythunimarched on Python, while the Shemites and riders ofZinggattacked the empire by its western borders.[5]\nIn Python, the slaves of Acheron, including Hyborians and Shemites, led by the Shemite womanMahalat, prepared for rebellion as the Hyborians marched upon the city.\nDue to an encounter with the mirrors ofTuzun Thune,ConanofCimmeriaandRed SonjaofHyrkaniabriefly found themselves taking part in the fabled rebellion, joining them.[5]Red Sonja was confronted to Xaltotun and stole theHeart of Ahrimanfrom him. Xaltotun tried to use theHeart of Tammuzto retrieve Sonja and the Heart of Ahriman. The Heart of Tammuz instead showed him more treachery from. Gien the situation, Xaltotun fled, leaving the Heart of Tammuz behind.\nMeanwhile, Conan, sent by the rebels to slay Bafomai, managed to kill Kheperu and tricked the Cimmerian guardsmen to turn on their hated Acheronian fellows, just as the Hyborian horde was in view of Python.[9]\nMany artifacts were lost during the Sack of Python:\nThe city was completely destroyed,[6]razed to the grounds.[10]\nFinally,Old Stygiajoined the conflict on Acheron's side, but too late to prevent Acheron's destruction. Furious, the Kothians overran all ofShem, sackedKuthchemes, and pushed the Stygians back beyond theStyx.[11]\nIn Kuthchemes, the Hyborians slaughtered Thugra Khotan's devotees, but were unable to breach into his ivory dome, and consequently fled the ruined city, where Thugra Khotan was preserved for three thousands years by his magic.[12]\nFocused on the south, Koth did not benefit from the territorial gains attempted by other Hybori tribes from the ruins of Acheron.[11]"

Unable to fulfil his wish, he gave Conan advices and his waist-belt given to him by aStygianpriest, before expiring.\nLater that day, Conan met with Kerim Shah and hisIrakzaimercenaries, and united with them. They approached the tower of the Acolytes and slaughtered them all, leaving only Conan, Kerim Shah, and four Irakzai.[1]The party went on to confront the Black Seers.[6]"

He slew the Pictish war-chief but was himself mortally wounded. Garrad was saved by a mysterious Pictish shaman who transplanted him with the heart of a god.\nAfter this, Old Garrad never aged.

The tribe's Bear shaman fled before the infection but later rescued Conan as he fled the village as well. Using gifts he had collected across his travels for his tribe, Conan managed to defeat most of them without bloodshed.

They were the sole masters of the hieroglyphic script, and controlled the destiny of Stygia to further their own personal ambitions. The cult of Set was seen with dread by theHyborians.[6]\nYoungThoth-Amonwas sent as an acolyte to the seminary of the Priests of Set, deep within the marshes of theRiver Styx. He proved to be the worst student they had ever seen, refusing instruction from anyone and claiming he would dominate them all someday. His arrogance and defiance grew in spite of his punishments. Consequently, they punished all the other acolytes except for Thoth-Amon, causing the priests to discipline him themselves. During such a session, Thoth-Amon prayed for the first time in his life toSet. Afterwards, Thoth-Amon became a model student, dominating many or all fields. The night of the Final Trial, in which the acolytes are tasked to bring a sacrifice to demonstrate their commitment to Set, Thoth-Amon trapped acolytes and priests inside a temple he proceeded to set ablaze, his offering to the serpent god. He ordained himself as a priest of Set with his god's blessing, who appeared before him in the form of a large serpent, and instructed him to recover theSerpent Ring, which was buried in a hidden tomb since the dawn of man.[7]\nBy theAge of Conan, circa 10,000 BC, the Priests of Set were forbidden inZingara.[14]\nIn an attempt to useConanto seize theBlack LotusinKhemi, use it to enslave humanity and reclaim the world, Amintas and many members, possibly the whole Order of the Serpent, were destroyed by Conan.[5]\nUpon Conan's return to the Hyborian Age from theModern Age, the Priests of Set resurrectedThulsa Doom, intending Thulsa Doom to slay Conan and use both of their blood to usher a new age of Set and fulfil the Prophecy of the Twice-Returned Men.[15]Thulsa Doom captured Conan[16]but the ritual was foiled by Conan's fellowSavage Avengers.[17]\nWhile Stygia gave way toEgypt, the Cult of Set endured, tough declined over the centuries. With the rise of thenew gods,Sethsought to usurp the power of Set, and thus had the leaders of the Cult of Set invited before him, where he presented himself (appearing first as a giant serpent, then in his humanoid form), and asked them to address them as Seth.[1]"

They were set in a part ofEuropeuntil driven off by theGauls, and subsequently in theBritish Islesuntil they were driven off by theCelts. They also battled theRoman Empirecirca 200 AD, then the neighboring Celt/Britishkingdoms circa the 6th century.\nAt the time ape-like humans served theSerpent-Men, a Pictish shaman discovered on cave paintings or carvings that reptilians, including the Serpent-Men and theMan-Serpents, could not say nor stand to hear the phrase, \"Ka nama kaa lajerama\". The humans weaponized this phrase to overthrow the Serpent-Men masters and slaughter the Man-Serpents. After centuries of fighting, the humans erroneously believed to have annihilated both of the serpent races.[12]\nFrom the time of war against the Serpent-Men, these words became engraved in the souls of all men,[13]and its knowledge was passed down among the Picts.\nDuring thePre-Cataclysmic Age, the Picts lived on thePictish Isles,[14]a chain of islands in theWestern Ocean,[1]west of theThuriaand ofAtlantis. Along with the Atlanteans and theLemurians, they were thebarbariansof their age. The crumbling Thurian civilizations employed barbarian mercenaries (Picts, Atlanteans and Lemurians) as their armies, and consequently, their generals, their statesmen and often their kings were barbarians.[15]\nA thousand years beforeKull, the Picts became the allies ofValusia.[16]\nThat alliance kept on at least of until the rule of Kull.[16]\nWhen theGreat Cataclysmoccurred, the Pictish Isles were heaved up to form the mountain peaks of a new continent.[15]Its inhabitants perished, but a significant colony of them already established along the mountains of Valusia's south frontier were virtually unharmed.[2][17]\nThe Atlanteans and Picts of the mainland fought in the west of the continent. The powerful Pictish nation outnumbered the Atlanteans, who were hurled back into a state of savagery while the evolution of the Picts stopped. Five hundred years after the Cataclysm, both kingdoms vanished. TheLesser Cataclysmachieve their ruin begun by their tribal wars. The Picts then remained as scattered clans of cave-dwelling savages with primitive speech, living in the southwest.[2]\n1500 years after the Lesser Cataclysm, the Picts apparently defied the laws of nature, neither by progressing or retrogressing, but by remaining savages.\nPicts invaded theValley of Zinggand merged with its nameless tribe of agricultural dwellers. The mixed race was in turn absorbed by a conquering tribe ofHybori, and the resulting kingdom becameZingara.\nThe Picts that remained in thePictish Wildernesswere confronted by their eastern neighbors, the inhabitants of theBossonian Marches, which was inhabited by descendants of an aboriginal race mixed with Hyborians.[5]\nThe ever more powerful Picts (as well as theNordheimrand the Bossonians) would cause incessant bickering with their Cimmerian neighboors.\nAround that time, theNemediapriest ofMitra,Arus, decided to introduce theworship of Mitrato the Picts. Despite having benefited from Hyborian civilization contact, the Picts had always fiercely resisted it. They still dwelt in clans generally at feud with each other. Arus nevertheless managed to remain safely among the Picts after meeting with the unusually intelligent chief namedGorm. In order to convince the Picts of Mitra's benefits, he spoke to Gorm about the wealth and fortune of the Hyborians, but Gorm foxed on the material riches rather than the worship of Mitra.[18]\nWishing to see the civilized lands, Gorm requested from Arus to conduct them there, and soon, Picts came and went freely into all Aquilonia. Despite Arus' belief he was converting Picts to Mitra, the savages simply wished, and managed to learn how, to mine their iron deposits and work them into weapon. In doing so, Gorm began to assert dominance over the other Pictish clans.\nSoon, increasing numbers of Picts entered service of Aquilonia's mercenary armies, and once their service completed, returned to the Pictish Wilderness with good ideas of civilized warfare. Gorm, then past middle age, became chief of chief, the closest approach to a king the Picts ad had in thousands of years. He moved against the frontier for war. Realizing his mistake, Arus tried to undo his work but was killed by a drunken Pict. Gorm nevertheless showed his gratitude to Arus by having the skull of his slayer set on top of the priest's cairn. Now clad in scale-mail and wielding steel weapons, the Picts burst upon the Bossonian frontiers, but were still held at bay for years by the Bossonians.\nDue to an eastern war against Nemedia, the Bossonian marches were undermanned, but hearing of the Pictish invasion, whole regiments of Bossonians quit the Nemedian campaign and returned, defeating the Picts in a great battle (while directly causing the defeat of the Aquilonians against the Nemedians). In their wrath, the Aquilonians lured and massacred the Bossonian chiefs then ravaged the marches.\nFree of the Bossonian resistance, and now an old man, Gorm led the Pictish invasion directly to the Aquilonian borders and swarmed the kingdom before its legions could return from the war in the east, causing (by synergy with other causes) the end of the Aquilonian Empire.[19]\nNpw the masters of Aquilonia, the Picts slaughtered nearly all the inhabitants. It is presumably the Pictish thrusts that prevented theHyrkaniansfrom addingStygiato their empire. 75 years after encountering Arus, Gorm was slain byHialmar, a chief of theNemedian Aesir.\nFor a short age, Hyrkanians and Picts battled each other over the ruins of the conquered world. As theGlacial Agesbegan, the Nordic tribes were driven southwards, pushing the Cimmerians as well. Hordes of Aesir and Vanir soon swarmed and reeled the Pictish Empire,[6]causing the end of their dominance and pushing them back to a Mesolithic level.[17]\nAnothercataclysmcreated theBritish Islandfrom the mountains of Western Cimmeria. In the west, the remnants of the Picts possessed the lands.\nIn a later age, they would be overthrown by the westward drift of both Cimmerians and Nordics.[6]\nPicts ruled allEurope, before their primitive empire was destroyed by theGauls.[20]\nWhen two kings arose in the land of the Picts, the conqueror drove out the vanquished, and so many Picts made boats and set sail for the\"far-off cliffs that gleamed white in the sunlight\". There, they were confronted to a race of red-haired barbarians whom they drove off. They built huts of wattle, tilled the soil, cleared the forest, before theCelticGaelscame from theIsles of the West. They drove the Picts into the forest and the mountains, though some Picts refused to leave the lands, hiding themselves into caverns, ravines and caves. Many Picts also mingled with the Celts. The CelticBritonswould later come fromGalliaand conquer the Gaels.\nA hundred years later, the BritonCororucwould be captured by the \"Little People\" (as the Picts would be known to the Britons), a group of the last pure-blooded Picts. Their priest, an old Pict cursed in his youth by an old witch to live until the last child of the Pictish race shall have passed, intended to slay Cororuc as part of his revenge upon the Celts (despite the fact it was the Gaels and not the Britons who had conquered the Picts). Cororuc was saved byBerula, a Pictwerewolfand chief among theAlban Picts, whom he had saved from apantherearlier, and was given guarantees of friendship by Berula and the old pict.[9]\nCirca 200 AD,[21]Bran Mak Morn, descendant ofKing Kull's friendBrule,[20]was the first acknowledged king of the Caledonian Picts in 500 years.[7]\nDuring the 6th century, Picts (as well asAnglo-SaxonsandIrish) were among the external enemies ofLogres,Uther Pendragon's kingdom.[22]\nThe Picts have worshiped (or at least invoked the names) ofmany entities:\nThe Pictish nation was divided in tribes and kingdoms which have varied across the ages.\nDuring thePre-Cataclysmic Age(at least during theAge of Kullcirca 18,500 BC), the Picts lived on thePictish Islesin tribes, all ruled over by an overking.[28]\nAdditionnally, the Picts had a colony on theThurianmainland.\nDuring theHyborian Age, the Picts were divided as such:\nAt least in the lateAge of Conan, circa 10,000 BC, the Picts were united among thePictish Confederation.\nAdditionnaly, theLigureanswere a non-Pict people that lived among the northwestern Picts, mostly at war, sometimes as allies.[51]After the Age of Conan, an unnamed tribe dwelt in theCountry of the Worm.\nCirca 200 AD, the Picts lived in theBritish Isles, including inCaledoniaandAlba, and were divided as such:"

Before Alhambra could use her ring, she was shot by an arrow from behind. With the shaft protruding from her back, Alhambra fell to the ground, and Conan, true to form, slayed the soldiers in a rage. Confronting Conan, the wizard summoned a three headed dragon with a wave of his hand. Conan swiftly slayed the beast, but Raskos escaped behind a stoutly barred door.

Sadly, when none of them ever found it, they all experienced such great despair that they felt compelled to return home and commit racial suicide. All of the half a million S'raphh accomplished this by flying down into the ocean of fire that then roared across the lunar surface.\nHowever, the S'raphh race had possessed a \"collective unconscious\" that survived the deaths of their physical bodies and continued to be tormented by their failure to find a reason for being. This unconsciousness felt a desire for revenge against all of creation for denying the S'raphh's quest for meaning. Eventually, after experiencing centuries of torment, this hatred birthed ademonicbeing that called itselfNull the Living Darkness, a monstrous entity who considered itself to be the enemy of all life and believed that only the dead belonged in a universe without purpose.[1]"

The most evolved of the Bird Men split into two factions:[3]\nThe ideological dispute grew into a civil war, with the help of Chthon,[8]who took advantage of this schism, and turned the factions against one another.[6]Ultimately, the Seraphim and Asura grew so destructive,[8]and the conflict caused massive earthly devastation, that Oshtur was forced to intervene.\nOshtur banished both the Asura and Seraphim,[5]and the whole city, into theDark Dimension(TheSplinter Realms, or the \"Archipelago of Anguish and Redemption\"),[6]to the extradimensionalPlanes of Sephiroth.[5]By 11,000 BC, the Bird Folk had \"ascended\".[9]One account mention the Winged Lords \"prepared to journey [...] into theHigher Realms\",[7]though the exact circumstances of the banishment are unknown.\nStranded in a hostile environment, the Seraphim and Asura secured an uneasy yet lasting peace. Together, they forged theCitadels of Sephiroth, who served as a line of defense against creature from the Dark Dimension that would invade theLower Realms.[6]The Bird Men continued to evolve there[5]and still reside there.[7]\nThe Seraphim became at some point (possibly before their banishment)mystic principalities, whose names were often invoked for spells such as theShield, theSkill, theSpeed, theCircle, and theSerum of the Seraphim. They became known across the dimensions for their spells of protection and defense.[2]They also became enemies ofShaeol, and would later be involved in the extradimensionalWar of the Seven Spheres, themselves opposing Shaeol.[10]To praise them, such as in a spell praising the Seraphim's Bright Shield, was to praise Oshtur herself.[11]\nTheS'raphh, a pure-hearted race that resided on Earth'sMoonmillenia ago, may have been descendants of the Bird-Men of Akah Ma'at, perhaps remnants of the Seraphim faction who might have evaded the banishment of their people.[12]"

Bourtai leads him through a cave system to the hideout of the local thieves' guild, and Conan, having once plied his trade as a thief, feels right at home. Bourtai explains how seven wizards came to Wan Tengri and overthrew the previous king and now rule the city with magic and terror. Conan also learns that Kassar, the shepherd who smuggled Conan into the city, has been captured and will be put to death. Feeling responsible, Conan vows to save him, and has Boutrai lead him to the Flam Tower where the wizards rule. The tower itself is surrounded by the magical red flames that cover the city, and each untrusting wizard's personal guard lies ready to attack each other for the slightest reason. Bourtai and Conan sneak into the underground passages of the tower, and the two are separated. Conan comes across the already deceased Kassar, and soon finds himself in an arena, a guest of the seven wizards. For their entertainment, the wizards send tigers and men after Conan, culminating in a beautiful masked woman. When Conan removes the veil, however, he sees only a skull - he is now facing Death herself."

All but one of the soldiers are killed by an avalanche seemingly triggered by Conan, but the remaining soldier, Captain Burgun, a survivor of the Battle of Venarium, is quickly seemingly dispatched by Conan, who heads deeper into Corinthia. He finds the abandoned city Lanjau, guarded by a giant gila monster. Conan scrambles up a ruined building and pitches rocks down on the creature until he weakens it enough to plunge his sword into its soft belly. He begins to poke around the city but is surprised by the reappearance of Burgun. The two decide the treasure of the city, and the possibility of encountering more monsters, is more important than any feud they might have, so they explore the city together. They find a vast treasure room stocked high with gold and jewels. As they start to divide the horde, six mummified guardians step from their resting places and attack. The two men flee, and the midday sun destroys the undead guardians when they leave the room. But this starts a chain reaction that crumbles the entire city. Conan makes it out, but Burgun seems to be trapped inside the city as it falls. Conan makes his way to a village tavern and encounters Jenna, whom he is still mad at for stealing his gold in Shadizar, which she spent to buy the tavern. Conan is less angry with her than he normally would be, since he believes he has a whole bag of jewels to spend but is chagrined when he finds they have turned to dust. A jade serpent he also took has meanwhile turned into a true serpent, which is actually to Conan's advantage, as it kills the magistrate and distracts the Corinthian soldiers, who have finally caught up with him. Conan and Jenna flee the village on horseback."

As he admires the view, a tentacled sea monster attacks the women from below. The barbarian springs to their rescue and as a reward, one of the women gives him a token to be redeemed at her place of work, Madame X'arthalla's Palace of Pleasure. Conan enters the capital of Zamora, promptly gets into a bar fight, and is taken prisoner by the local guard. As the soldier's ranks are thin, Conan is given the option of imprisonment or joining the royal guardsmen. Conan chooses to be a soldier, and impresses the troops when he passes a test by defeating another guardsmen. After several days of duty, Conan finally is able to take advantage of his token and visits the Palace of Pleasure. He is given a brief tour of the many rooms the Palace has to offer, and sees every type of fantasy being fulfilled by the staff. He also glimpses the sorceress Madame X'arthalla herself, before Conan finally gets restless enough to do with Nadia what he came to do. The next morning, while traveling with the royal entourage on a hunt, Conan comes across the king himself, who has been led nearly to his death by an image of his deceased wife. Conan barely reaches the monarch in time, as the vision of Satrina, the king's lost love was tempting him to fall from a cliff. In gratitude, the king makes Conan his personal bodyguard. That night, a woman appears in Conan's bedchamber and bewitches him into slaying the king. He snaps out of the spell, but not soon enough as he is attacked and defeated by the guards. He is set to be executed in a rather grisly style - sealed in a barrel that has been punched through with iron spikes, then dragged by a pair of horses out of town. Conan grasps two spikes and stiffens his body in order to not bounce around and get impaled, and he manages to survive the ordeal. He returns to the palace and sneaks in, seeking the king, only to discover the monarch has gone to the Palace of Pleasure. After a brief altercation with the guard, he makes his way to the brothel. Once there, he discovers much of the king's staff targeted for execution, although they don't realize the fantasies they have placed themselves in are about to turn deadly on the orders of the traitorous Captain of the Guard. Conan saves them all, and soon encounters Madame X'anthralla, the captain's partner. The sorceress distracts Conan by changing into the form of his mother, but is killed by Nadia. The king, embarrassed about the whole thing, gives Conan a bag of gems and tells him to get the hell out of town.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:"

He was hired as a staff colorist byTimely Comics, working under head coloristJon D'Agostino. In 1951, Goldberg himself became the manager of the coloring department. He colored almost every cover published byAtlas Comics, and many of the interior stories.[1]\nBesides coloring, Goldberg started penciling stories for Atlas. His early credits mostly include horror stories. He was a regular staff member of the company's regular Bullpen, but the entire bullpen was fired in 1957. Goldberg started work as a freelance colorist, while also studying storyboarding at the  School of Visual Arts.[2]\nIn the 1960s, Goldberg was hired as a freelance-colorist byMarvel Comics. While mostly uncredited, he was actually the main colorist of the company for much of the decade. Comic book historians credit him for the color designs for a number of Marvel characters, such as theFantastic Four, theHulk, andSpider-Man.[3]Other known, but uncredited, Marvel colorists from the same era wereGeorge Roussos,Marie Severin, andJim Steranko.[4]\nGoldberg also found work as a penciler and inker in Marvel's humor titles, which were featuring teenagers and career girls. He took over the series featuringMillie CollinsandPatsy Walker, and redesigned the characters. At the time these series were turning from slapstick titles to romantic comedies and adventures, and required more serious artwork than before.[5]Goldberg also contributed to the plot of the stories.[6]\nGoldberg may have penciled more Marvel stories than he was credited for. He was freelancing for various companies and felt that signing his work would mark him as a \"Marvel\" artist and create complications. Comic book historians have noted that some stories in Goldberg's style were credited toSol Brodsky. Brodsky was the production manager of Marvel at the time, and may have simply signed on uncredited work by Goldberg.[7]\nGoldberg stopped freelancing for Marvel in 1969, when he was hired by DC Comics to work on their own teenage humor titles. He worked for DC Comics until 1972, and then he was hired on a permanent basis by Archie Comics. The publisher specialized in teenage humor titles, and as a freelancer Goldberg had penciled various stories for them. Goldberg was one of Archie Comics' main artists from the 1970's to 2010. He worked with most of the company's leading characters and penciled various high-profile stories.[8]\nIn the 1980s, Goldberg penciled some issues for DC Comics again. Following his retirement from Archie Comics, Goldberg created some covers for Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing. He also penciled a 2011 story for Bongo Comics. In 2012, he started producing graphic novels based on licensed characters. In 2013, Goldberg was involved in an automobile accident and was injured. He eventually recovered from his injuries. In 2014, Goldberg suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. Two weeks later, he died in the hospital. He was 82 years old.[9]"

A wise and benevolent being representing truth, order and justice, Ahura Mazda started populating his domain with life. His birth was soon followed in the one of his twisted mirror image and antithesis,Ahriman, who personified deceit and chaos. Ahriman rejected the peace offerings of Ahura Mazda and tried to kill the life who had been imbued in his domain. After a prolonged battle, Ahura Mazda narrowly overcame and banished Ahriman to theNether Realms.\nMithra, god of light and justicewas one of theYazatascreated by Ahura Mazda to uphold order and justice and in preparation for Ahriman's return.\nBanished, Ahriman created theDivs, demonic gods with the sole purpose of opposing the Yazatas. Since then, the two groups have waged an endless war against each often, often using mortals as pawn in attempt to gain the upper hand.[1]\nIn the guise of the priestess to theOracle of Ophir, presenting herself as far wiser and ancient that Mitra, voiced during theHyborian Age of ConanbyRenquis(either from the oracle's inspiration, or from Renquis' insanity), claimed to have nursed him when he was a baby.[8]\nAt some point in thePre-Cataclysmic Age, or possibly between theGreat Cataclysmand theLesser Cataclysm(see notes on Lahrentz's page),Mitrawas seemingly worshiped, and was invoked by pirateCaptain Lahrentzas he shipwrecked on the coast.[9]\nAt the timeAcheronwas an ally of the independent kingdom ofOphir, Mitra was among the gods of Ophir, and was disregarded by the Acheronians as a weakling,[10]and was considered by an unnamed Ophirean wizard as \"a puny deity\" and \"a young godling whose day is not yet\"[11](that wizard self-styled himself a \"man of the gods\").[10]\nAhura Mazda sent Mithra to serve onEarthas his representative over 15,000 years ago,[1]before the end of theAge of Acheron.\nThe first worshipers of Mitra hired a sorcerer who used a crystal skull, theSkull of Set, to boundKhorusanddemonsfromHellsummoned by the worshipers ofSetin the city ofEidoran.[12]\nMitra was himself served by aheavenly hostofangelsandsaints,[13]the formers including thePhantom.[14]He also had a warrior-son,Shamahs, worshiped as well in theWestern Kingdoms.[15]\nFrom 11,000 to 8,000 B.C., as Mitra, he had a strong worship,[3]being worshiped by a number of monotheistic religions.[1]His worship was almost universal inAquilonia,Argos,Nemedia,Ophir, andZingara, though there was small cults of such deities asAsura,Ibis,Ishtar, and evenSet, the serpent-god ofStygia. While most in the Hyborian Age acknowledged rival deities to their own,[13]some priests and followers of Mitra declared him the one true god,[16][13]deserving a monotheistic devotion and worship.Koth,KhauranandKhorajaalso followed the faith of Mitra. His cult was also known inCorinthia, despite its city-states' patron gods.[13]Though its worship was imported inZamora,[17]Zamora never adopted Mitra, hosting a number weird and mysterious cults and divinities.\nKoth, when falling underShem's and Stygia's influence, abandoned Mitra's worship, as did Khoraja and Khauran, in favor for Ishtar, whose rites were more sensual.[13]TheGazaliwere a people that formerly dwelt insouthernKothcirca 10,900 BC. They were driven into theSouthern DesertofStygiabecause of their belief inMitra. There, they founded the city ofGazal.[18]TheGundermenadopted Mitra inBori's place at the time they joinedAquilonia(that being their greatest concession).[19]\nDuring theAge of Conan, Mitra was served many priests and adventurers, among them theFollowers of MitrainArgos(including the guards inEidoranand theBrides of Mitrasuch asTamara),[12]a strange, untypical offshoot of the worship of Mitra\" inD'Eim[20]whose Oracle in fact served an unnamed Dark Lord,[21]theMitran Knightsorder ofAquilonia,[22]orVitellus, warrior-priest of theCult of Mitra.[23]The dark sorcererOrastesused to be a priest of Mitra,[24]as was the adventurerIxastophanis, a lapsed priest of Mitra.[25][verification needed]\nMitra occasionally intervened directly to protecthumanityfrom the likes of theElder GodSetorDemonssuch asMoluborXotli. He and his priests became frequent allies of Conan, who would become king of Aquilonia.[1]\nThe Yazatas ended up being worshiped on Earth in thePersian/Iranianplateau, as well as inCentral AsiaandIndia, from 1000 BC into modern days,[1]eventually supplanting the worship of theVedic Gods.\nMithra retained a strong following in believers ofZoroastrianism.[3]\nThe belief of Mitra presented him as a gentle god ruling over aheavenly hostofsaintsandangels, and preaching mercy above vengeance. He was humanity's eternal judge, and either rewarded inheavenor punished inhelleach soul regarding their deeds in life.\nTheMitran religionexpressly forbade blood sacrifices[13](though it is known that Mitran priests did sacrifice once two pigs and aCatamiteboy),[26]its rites being distinguished by their simplicity, dignity, and beauty.[13]\nTo the followers of Mitra, some elements were sacred:\nThe statues of Mitra weren't meant to be worshiped themselves as idols, but were to represent Mitra in idealized forms,[13]though one representation of him was a bull.[26]Khorajahad statues of him in its temples.[27][28]\nThe Hyborians didn't usually carved images of Mitra out of sublime respect, at least not in their capitals,[15]nor in theTemple of a Thousand GodsinMessantia, capital ofArgos.[28]Though, exceptions existed:"

Meanwhile, Conan agress to slay the sorcerer in return for a sword that had caught his eye, but after his departure the villagers discuss their intent to betray him. Conan sneaks into Zukala's fortress and watches as the sorcerer summons a demon, Jagta-Noga, to punish the villagers. Conan is discovered by Zephra, and explains her odd behavior - she saw a vision of her fate to love Conan, and Conan standing over her dead body. The two are interrupted by Zukala, who runs off when Conan shatters his mask, the source of his power. Enough of the mask remains for a few magical tricks, however, and commands his daughter to turn into the tigress and slay the Cimmerian. She refuses, however, but Jaggta-Noga returns to defend the wizard. Zephra leaps between demon and barbarian. Zephra is dealt a near-killing blow, and, horrified, Zukala sends the demon away. Zukala vanishes with his daughter, who, while still alive, is no longer as loyal to her father as she had been, and this saddens the sorcerer more than anything else. Conan takes the gold left behind, decides it's payment enough, and continues to Shadizar."

Swampy taiga forests probably clothed its high southern regions thinly. Glaciers crept down from theEiglophian Mountainsin the south and theBlue Mountainson the frontier with Aesgaard. Far to the north were more mountains, crowned with a permanent ice cap that grew larger as the climate changed.[citation needed]\nThe resident population were theVanir, typically red-haired and blue-eyed. They were a warrior culture. Their skills honed in near-constant conflict with their neighbors in Aesgard and Cimmeria.[1]\nThe valley in Vanaheim, close to the town ofSuhron(located at three hundred miles fromZahrahn, an isle that became part of the northernPictish Wilderness) was originally an ocean's coast, whereLahrentzwrecked after the crew was massacred by theChildren of Rhan.[4]\nTheVanirwere probably descendants of the people of thepre-Cataclysmickingdom of Thule,[5]as were theAesir.[6]\n2,500 years after theLesser Cataclysm(which seemingly took place in 17,500 BC), circa 15,000 BC, theNordics(Aesirand Vanir) drove all the remainingHyborian tribesout of all the snow-countries, save forHyperborea. Their land was known asNordheim,[7]the Vanir living inVanaheim, the western part of it.[1]\n500 years after theAge of Conan, the north was the theater of constant bickering between theCimmerians, theBossonians, thePictsand the Nordheimr.[8]\nCirca 9,500 BC, before thepost-Hyborian Cataclysm, Vanir adventurers came toStygia, where they overthrew the ruling class building a vast southern empire which they calledEgypt. The early Pharaohs boasted to descend from them.[9]\nAfter thepost-Hyborian Cataclysm, which occurred between 9,500[9]and 8,000 BC,[10][11][12]the northern[5]Vanir, one of the variations among theSons of Aryas(orAryans), descended into theDanes.[9]\nVanaheim in general was submerged by theNorwegian Sea,[13]though Northern Vanaheim on theEuropean continentwas stated to be later part of Scandinavia."

Howard,Roy Thomas,Barry Windsor-SmithFirstConan the Barbarian#1(July, 1970)Cimmeria was the barbaric northern land whereConanwas born. Its northern neighbors include traditional allyAesgaardand traditional foeVanaheim. Its southern neighborAquiloniawas a more occasional opponent.\nCimmeria was a land of hills and dark forests. It was described as permanently gloomy and grey-skied. Their environment seems to have had an influence on the mentality of Cimmerians, who tend to be moody and somber in spirit. Both theAesirandVanirare considered to be more \"high-spirited\".[1]\nDuring thePre-Cataclysmic Age, the people of \"Elder Cimmeria\" werebarbariansliving on theThurianmainland,[2]divided in tribes.[3]Those tribes existed contemporaneously withAtlantis, and intermarried with Atlantean colonists onThuriabefore theGreat Cataclysm.[4]*\nAfter theGreat Cataclysm, the Atlantean stock was preserved in the daughter-colony, which devolved into savagery, and became known as few thousand years later as the Cimmerians,[2]\nCirca 13,000 BC, the Kings ofAcheronat south fought the Cimmerians but were never able to conquer them.[5][6]Some Cimmerian youths were brought back to Python, where they made up theKing's Elite Guard.[6]\nDuring theHyborian Age, the Cimmerians were divided into various tribes, which sustain themselves through hunting and foraging.[1]\nCirca 10,000 BC,Conanof theSnowhawk Tribeventured outside Cimmeria, and became a world-renowned warrior, thief, pirate and explorer, became king of the Hyboria kingdom of southernAquilonia, before abdicating to explorer the world past theWestern Ocean.\nCirca 9,500 BC, the Cimmerians resisted to theHyrkanianinvaders who stormed the otherHyborian Kingdoms.\nThe Cimmerians were eventually displaced by the greatNordheimrsurge fleeing the advance of the glaciers. Many Cimmerians moved eastward, settling on the southwestern shore of theVilayet.[4]\nThe Cimmerians were ancestors of many people in later history:\nThe regions of Cimmeria during theHyborian Age of Conan\nThe chief deity of the Cimmerians wasCrom, a grim god who seats in isolation on a high mountain. When a boy is born, a ritual asks the gods to grant it the \"power to strive and slay\". This is considered enough of a demand. Their gods are conceived as otherwise indifferent to humanity, and prayer is only to be used on rare occasions. Calling the attention of a cruel and/or indifferent deity to your person is thought foolhardy. The Cimmerians have a similar cheerless view of the afterlife. They believe that all souls are destined to wonder for eternity on a realm of gray clouds, cold mists, and moaning winds,[1]which sounds suspiciously close to depictions of Cimmeria itself.\nThe creatures of folklore of the Cimmerians included theFrost Giants, theKobols, and theWere-Demons.[8]\nThe Cimmerians always mounted their horses from the left side, as they believed adevilwould enter the horse if they did from the right.[9]\nEarth-83600's Cimmeria"

One night, after Fafnir had subdued a goldsmith, Blackrat stabbed him, and the pair stole three gold items. They were fighting over the dividing of the loot, when they were attacked byConan, a young thief at the time. Blackrat stabbed Fafnir while aiming for Conan, and was knocked out. Conan left with the booty, leaving Fafnir for dead.[1]Fafnir recovered from the weak blow.[3]\nFafnir went on to become the captain of a crew ofpiratesof theInland Seacomposed ofZingarancorsairs, nomads out ofZamboula, deserters from the world's navies and even one from theAquilonian Army.\nBoarding aTuraniangalley, the pirates slaughtered all the crewmen, save for Conan, whom Fafnir knocked out. Though his men wanted to have Conan slain, Fafnir convinced them to spare him, if he was bound to the mast. Fafnir attempted to recruit Conan into his diminished crew, but Conan refused upon learning that Fafnir was Vanir, the enemies of theCimmerians.[3]\nInto the storm, the ship was taken into the dreadedWhite Mist, where no man have ever gone and returned alive, and wrecked itself on a reef. Fafnir freed Conan before leaving the ship. Fafnir lost consciousness on a piece of wreckage, and was about to be devoured by ashark, but was saved by Conan. Stranded on the beach ofBal-Sagoth, Fafnir was defied by Conan, full of racial hatred for the Vanir. Fafnir reluctantly accepted, but soon laid down his weapon, soon followed by Conan, thus started the friendship between them.\nAt that instant,Groth-Golka, the last of theLizard-Godsappeared, pursuing a girl. In a remarkable feat of strength, attributed to Fafnir's invocations of his gods, Fafnir broke the monster's neck. The girl,Kyrie, was the Vanir daughter of Rane, the Reaver. Stranded on the isle alone, she was confused by the natives of Bal-Sagoth as thesea-goddessAala. Eventually, she was exiled to the other part of the isle by her rival, oldGothan.\nKyrie offered the two warriors great rewards for their help, intending to use the legend which said that when two men would come out of the sea, Bal-Sagoth would fall. In the city, \"Aala\" warned the people, and forced the kingSkato flee. Fafnir and Conan help \"Aala\" conquer back her throne, but are betrayed by her. Accidentally they bring down the statue of the local god and his temple, the whole city and the isle crumble. Floating on their raft through the Vilayet sea, they are rescued by a war ship of Prince Yezdigerd of Turan and join his war campaign.[3][4]\nFafnir and Conan participate at the siege ofMakkalet. In the first battle, Fafnir is wounded by a flame arrow and falls into the sea. Later he is rescued by the Turans, but his left arm is infected and is amputated. Later in the siege of Makkalet, a turanian officer orders that the dead are thrown overboard, including the wounded Fafnir. Conan is enraged and avenges Fafnir by killing the officer. Then he has to flee the turanian ship, on the way wounding Prinde Yezdigerd; he then sides with Makkalet.[5][6][7]\nAlong his adventures, Fafnir came to have be grafted with ademonhand instead of his original left arm, and was consequently known asFafnir Hellhand.[2]\nFafnir became involved in theFree Companions and the Kozaki, led by Conan, alongside other of Conan's fellow warriors befriended along his adventures, such asZula,Red Sonja, andTurghol.[8][9][10][11][12]\nFafnir remained with Conan, Zula and other Kozaki, opposing Turanian attempts at the annexation of theGrassy Steppersspanning fromZamorato theVilayet Sea. They stopped a Turanian squad (tasked byShah Amurath, lord ofAkif) to retrieve theSacred FireofOrmuzand the bones of the sorcererKulan GathforPrince Yezdigerd) on the trail ofIsparana(a former Kozak herself, who had stolen the Turanian sergeant's mount after being recognized as a Kozak). The Turanians were easily slain, though Fafnir came close to fall under possession of his demon hand. Learning of the Turanian plot, Conan dispatched Zula, Fafnir, and Isparana to bring the Kozaks on, going himself toArmatito obtain the items desired by Shah Amurath. Defeated by Armati and the Turanians,[2]Zula, Fafnir, and Isparana were closing by the Kozaks when Isparana made up a pretext to go to her baby (born from her mating with the demonWrarrl the Devourer of Souls), only to discover her \"son\" had grown into the fully adult Wrarrl. Suspicious of Isparana, Zula and Fafnir parted ways, Fafnir following her while Zula went to the Kozaks. Arriving to Isparana's hideout, Fafnir help Isparana to escape by collapsing the cave over Wrarrl. Meanwhile, Conan was captured and sent to theHanging Gardens.[13]As Kulan Gath was resurrected and Conan upon to be slain, the Kozaks charged upon Akif, while Isparana and Fafnir scaled the wall and assisted Conan directly, freeing from the vines of the Hanging Gardens. The three then cut their way through Turanian soldiers. The fight escalated with the death of Armati, the summoning of thefire-demonOrmuz, the timely arrival of Wrarrl who protected his \"mother\", the death of Kulan Gath, and finally the destruction of theGreat Damof Akif, flooding the city (though sparing Shah Amurath, who would likely lust for revenge), allowing the Kozaks to retreat, to fight another day.[14]\nFafnir invoked the name ofGods of the North, such asBragiandYmir's name, but also mentioned\"Dagon's cellar\"[3](possibly mentioning the eldritch horror, aquatic monster, and possibleGreat Old One).[15]"

Conan's crew is defeated and killed, but Conan is pressed into service of the pirates. Before anything can happen, however, the ship is scuttled on a hidden reef in mysterious white mists, and only Conan and Fafnir make it to shore. They fight for a minute, then realize they are too evenly matched and have no real reason to fight anyway. Together, they rescue a girl from a dinosaur-like monster. The girl, Kyrie, reveals that the two are on the ancient island Bal-Sagoth, and that she also was shipwrecked on the island but, as she had scarlet hair like the sea-goddess Aala, was taken as an object of worship. The high priest Gothan, however, took over and killed those loyal to Kyrie, and dumped the girl on the lagoon to be killed. Fafnir and Conan, desperate for food, agree to help Kyrie get her kingdom back, fulfilling an ancient prophecy. The three reach the imposing castle and march right in, relying on the power of the prophecy of two men from the sea who will destroy the reptile guardian. Gothan's puppet king, Ska, has his champion, Vertorix, challenge Conan, but after a brief battle, the onlookers discover that Vertorix is an empty suit of armor that fights like a man! Kyrie realizes that Gothan controls the armor, and using her mirrored headdress, reflects the sun into Gothan's eyes, causing him to lose concentration. The armor crumbles to the ground and Gothan and Ska flee, leaving Kyrie, Fafnir, and Conan in charge."

With Cyclops, Beast, and Iceman injured, the Professor allows them to be taken by the military paramedics to the hospital, but mentally cautions his students to protect their secret identities.\nAt the hospital, the doctors are unsure how to treat Iceman, who is in an unconscious delirium, prompting Professor to worry about this potentially being his first failure. Checking on the other X-Men under the pretext as a casual friend instead of their leader, the Professor overhears a doctor commenting on the fact that they could learn so much more if they knew who the young Mutant's parents are. Finding the Angel flying over a crowd of nurses checking the answering service with the mansion, the Professor is informed by Warren that his parents are coming to visit because they hadn't hear from their son in a while. The Professor calls the Worthingtons and tells them that he's on a \"field trip\" with his students for materials for a coming research paper. Although the Worthingtons are relieved, they insist on stopping by for a visit for only a few minutes. Concerned, not only over this, but his sense of dread, the Professor sends Warren back to the mansion to scout around.\nWarren arrives at the mansion to find no trouble on the grounds, however, upon walking inside he is almost smashed by an axe which suddenly levitates out of the hand of a decorative suit of armor and smashes into the wall. Flying through the mansion, the Angel accidentally flies into a mirror and knocks himself out. His strange attacker watches, lurking in the shadows, boasting that this is the first of the X-Men he will defeat.\nBack at the hospital, a doctor is almost done his examination of Cyclops, wanting to finish up by examining his eyes. Cyclops gives him a demonstration of his powerful optic blasts, explaining that he cannot control them. Finding no other problems with the young mutant, the doctor dismisses Cyclops into the Professor's care and the two walk the grounds discussing the state of the other X-Men. The Professor has lost mental contact with Angel and decides that Beast and Marvel Girl should remain at the hospital to watch over Iceman, who is still too injured to move. The Professor and Cyclops agree to return to the Mansion.\nThere they find no sign of Warren, and are suddenly startled when Cerebro's mutant alarm goes off. Going to investigate, the Professor examines his computer and learns that there is a super-powerful evil mutant on the premises. Before Cyclops can warn him, the Professor is suddenly wrapped up in the coils of a mental-wave distorter and sealed behind a transparent shield. Cyclops attempts to blast through it with his optic blast, but finds it redirected against him.\nThe lights then go out and Cyclops is attacked by their foe in the darkness. Unable to see his foe, Cyclops is easily felled in hand-to-hand combat against their unknown attacker. Back at the hospital, Beast has totally recovered from his injuries, which he shows off for Marvel Girl. Jean is concerned about the Professor and also decides to check on Bobby. When they find that Iceman is still in a coma, the two decide to venture to the mansion to see what's happened to the Professor and the others.\nArriving at the mansion, they rush into the front door and are shocked to find that the entire inside hallway has been coated with a friction-less surface. Beast suddenly slides across the room and into a specially prepared room. Jean manages to avoid the same fate by using her telekinetic powers. She is then confronted by their mystery foe, whom she recognizes immediately. Trying to keep him back with her telekinetic powers, she passes out after inhaling odorless sleep gas. Back at the hospital, the doctor caring for Iceman is called into the mutant's room because his pulse is getting weaker and he's becoming more delirious. With no other choice, the doctor decides to try a new experimental sulfa drug on Iceman and sends the nurse to go and get it.\nBack at the mansion, the X-Men's mysterious attacker seals them in an enclosure of a high altitude balloon and sets it loose with the hopes that they will perish in the sky when they float up to 100,000 feet into the air. Releasing the X-Men into the air, the villain is satisfied that he has finally destroyed the X-Men. Shortly after, the Worthingtons arrive to visit their son; however, when they knock at the door they are greeted by the man who attacked the X-Men; none other than Magneto!\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nProfessor X, Angel, Cyclops, and Marvel Girl have all been defeated by Magneto, who put the team into a high altitude hot-air balloon, hoping that his hated foes would perish once it reaches its destination of 100,000 feet. Magneto revels over the victory, magnetically lifting the mansion out of its foundation. He then decides to use the mansion as his own base of power then sets the house back down to the ground. Entering the residence of his hated foes, he then uses his magnetic powers to destroy Cerebro. However, his destruction is interrupted when the Worthingtons -- Warren's parents -- arrive for a visit. Magneto confronts them at the front door and uses magnetic hypnotism to put them under his thrall, ordering them to go sleep upstairs in the upper bedrooms. Magneto then comes to realize that one of the X-Men -- Iceman -- is missing, and waits for him to return to the mansion so that his revenge can be complete. Magneto boasts how Iceman is the weakest of all the X-Men.\nMeanwhile, Iceman is still recovering from injuries sustained battling the Sentinels. His doctor injects the unconscious mutant with a new medicine with a special device. It stops the boy's delirious rantings; however, if he will awaken remains to be seen. Meanwhile, high above in the weather balloon that might mean their doom, Professor X exerts all his mental power to try and overload the mental-wave disruptor that has been attached to his head. His ploy succeeds and he revives the rest of the X-Men. They begin to assess their abysmal situation and wonder how Magneto could have returned, after being taken from Earth by the Stranger.\nBack at the X-Mansion, Magneto uses his magnetic powers to assist him in constructing a device that can duplicate body cells and create an army of mutant clones, using the Worthingtons as the source material. Probing the situation mentally, the Professor learns of Magneto's plans and tries to revive Iceman, who awakens from his coma and agrees to go out and try and stop Magneto. Marvel Girl is then instructed to use her telekinetic powers as an anchor, preventing their balloon from floating up any higher. The Professor then probes Magneto's mind so that he and the X-Men can learn how Magneto managed to return to Earth:\nThey discover that shortly after Magneto and Toad were taken to the Stranger's homeworld, Magneto began plotting his escape. One day, they were left to their own devices and Magneto -- taking advantage of the fact that the Stranger allowed them to roam his planet freely -- brought Toad to a location where a number of rocket ships had been collected by the Stranger and put on display in a museum. Magneto then used his magnetic powers to gain access to one of the rockets and after kicking Toad off the entrance ladder, Magneto flew the rocket back to Earth.\nBobby arrives at the mansion and spies on Magneto to learn what his plan is. Seeing Magneto creating Mutant clones from the Worthingtons DNA, Iceman sneaks into the room where they are sleeping and uses his ice powers to stop the flow of information, leaving the clones inert. Furious that his creations have not come to life, Magneto enters the room and attacks Iceman. Magneto underestimates Iceman's ability and Bobby manages to fight off Magneto's attacks, creating an ice slide to send the two of them out of the mansion.\nMeanwhile aboard the balloon, the Professor comes up with a solution to get them back on the ground. He orders Cyclops to use his optic blast to poke a pinpoint hole in the balloon so that the helium inside slowly leaks out and they can then safely descend to the ground below. The X-Men safely land on the ground and attack Magneto together, however the Master of Magnetism manages to fight them off. Before they can renew their attack, Magneto magnetically traps Iceman and threatens to kill him if the X-Men don't cease their fighting. Iceman tells the others not to surrender for him, however Angel flies in and manages to pull him free from Magneto's grasp.\nThe X-Men and Magneto resume their battle until Professor X tells them all to stop fighting and surrender. The X-Men are shocked at this order and Magneto gloats over his \"superiority\" over the X-Men. However, this only proves to be a delaying tactic on the Professor's part as he has delivered a mental summons to the stars, calling the Stranger back to Earth to collect Magneto. Magneto flees the scene, with the Stranger trailing behind him.\nThe X-Men then rush inside to stop the machine (which has now begun to operate since Iceman's ice has thawed) before it can bring Magneto's slave Mutants to life. With the machine deactivated, the clones disintegrate and the X-Men destroy the machine."

Shortly after, the Worthingtons arrive to visit their son; however, when they knock at the door they are greeted by the man who attacked the X-Men; none other than Magneto!\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nProfessor X, Angel, Cyclops, and Marvel Girl have all been defeated by Magneto, who put the team into a high altitude hot-air balloon, hoping that his hated foes would perish once it reaches its destination of 100,000 feet. Magneto revels over the victory, magnetically lifting the mansion out of its foundation. He then decides to use the mansion as his own base of power then sets the house back down to the ground. Entering the residence of his hated foes, he then uses his magnetic powers to destroy Cerebro. However, his destruction is interrupted when the Worthingtons -- Warren's parents -- arrive for a visit. Magneto confronts them at the front door and uses magnetic hypnotism to put them under his thrall, ordering them to go sleep upstairs in the upper bedrooms. Magneto then comes to realize that one of the X-Men -- Iceman -- is missing, and waits for him to return to the mansion so that his revenge can be complete. Magneto boasts how Iceman is the weakest of all the X-Men.\nMeanwhile, Iceman is still recovering from injuries sustained battling the Sentinels. His doctor injects the unconscious mutant with a new medicine with a special device. It stops the boy's delirious rantings; however, if he will awaken remains to be seen. Meanwhile, high above in the weather balloon that might mean their doom, Professor X exerts all his mental power to try and overload the mental-wave disruptor that has been attached to his head. His ploy succeeds and he revives the rest of the X-Men. They begin to assess their abysmal situation and wonder how Magneto could have returned, after being taken from Earth by the Stranger.\nBack at the X-Mansion, Magneto uses his magnetic powers to assist him in constructing a device that can duplicate body cells and create an army of mutant clones, using the Worthingtons as the source material. Probing the situation mentally, the Professor learns of Magneto's plans and tries to revive Iceman, who awakens from his coma and agrees to go out and try and stop Magneto. Marvel Girl is then instructed to use her telekinetic powers as an anchor, preventing their balloon from floating up any higher. The Professor then probes Magneto's mind so that he and the X-Men can learn how Magneto managed to return to Earth:\nThey discover that shortly after Magneto and Toad were taken to the Stranger's homeworld, Magneto began plotting his escape. One day, they were left to their own devices and Magneto -- taking advantage of the fact that the Stranger allowed them to roam his planet freely -- brought Toad to a location where a number of rocket ships had been collected by the Stranger and put on display in a museum. Magneto then used his magnetic powers to gain access to one of the rockets and after kicking Toad off the entrance ladder, Magneto flew the rocket back to Earth.\nBobby arrives at the mansion and spies on Magneto to learn what his plan is. Seeing Magneto creating Mutant clones from the Worthingtons DNA, Iceman sneaks into the room where they are sleeping and uses his ice powers to stop the flow of information, leaving the clones inert. Furious that his creations have not come to life, Magneto enters the room and attacks Iceman. Magneto underestimates Iceman's ability and Bobby manages to fight off Magneto's attacks, creating an ice slide to send the two of them out of the mansion.\nMeanwhile aboard the balloon, the Professor comes up with a solution to get them back on the ground. He orders Cyclops to use his optic blast to poke a pinpoint hole in the balloon so that the helium inside slowly leaks out and they can then safely descend to the ground below. The X-Men safely land on the ground and attack Magneto together, however the Master of Magnetism manages to fight them off. Before they can renew their attack, Magneto magnetically traps Iceman and threatens to kill him if the X-Men don't cease their fighting. Iceman tells the others not to surrender for him, however Angel flies in and manages to pull him free from Magneto's grasp.\nThe X-Men and Magneto resume their battle until Professor X tells them all to stop fighting and surrender. The X-Men are shocked at this order and Magneto gloats over his \"superiority\" over the X-Men. However, this only proves to be a delaying tactic on the Professor's part as he has delivered a mental summons to the stars, calling the Stranger back to Earth to collect Magneto. Magneto flees the scene, with the Stranger trailing behind him.\nThe X-Men then rush inside to stop the machine (which has now begun to operate since Iceman's ice has thawed) before it can bring Magneto's slave Mutants to life. With the machine deactivated, the clones disintegrate and the X-Men destroy the machine."

Her northern border withKothwas more or less stabilized along thenatural great escarpmentbetween the two lands by G.C. 2250,[8]\nShem during theAge of Conancirca 10,000 BC\nConanandKeivlanded unconscious on the coast of Shem, drifting far southward fromNostume's accursed isle.[9]\nWhile wandering in the great forest, Keiv was kidnapped by the witch queenRenas part of her plan to escapeImhotep's wrath. Imhotep appeared with its Sky-Horde and killed an entireKothian Army, while Conan rescued his friend and decapitated Renrutanit, whose still-living head was later recovered byPathir.[10]\nA short time later, in a castle on a deserted plain in the northern region of Shem, the magical Council of the Seven used their arcane power to resurrect theDevourer of Soulsfrom death after his battle with the Ravager of Worlds.[11]\nSome time later, Conan saved a girl namedRosinafrom a band of thugs who stalked her at night. Bringing her back home, theCimmerianmet her mother,Lady Sabbatha, andLord Dakin, who later hired him to sneak into her house and steal a couple of magical artifacts for him. Conan's thieving attempt was suddenly interrupted by the arrival of a couple ofSimianthros, who took the items and kidnapped Rosina. Asked by Lady Sabbatha to bring them back, Conan tracked the apes down toStygia.[12]\nAt some point, jealous of the human beautyIsolene, Ishtar had her placed in a tower guarded by demons-and then forgot about her. Ishtar was served by a wizard named Libro, who became greedy and stole her powerstone. Under the alias of Alonia, Ishtar regained her powerstone.Nergaland Tammuz were also encountered by mortal adventurers at this time, as were Bel and Ashtoreth.[citation needed]\nTel-Ammonwas a city-state of Shem ruled byQueen Atala. Atala was seduced and slain byNebuhan, who only married her to become king. However, Atala's daughterAyeletescaped, and about two decades later, with Conan's help, would avenge her mother. Upon the advice of aVanirmystic, Nebuhan had placed his soul in a mystical container. Ayelet and Conan acquired the container.[citation needed]\nThe pirate queenBêlitof Shem became Conan's lover and sailed with him for three years.[citation needed]\nConan had otherShemite-related adventures, including an adventure in Asgalun of Pelishtia, meeting king Akhirom, who worshiped Pteor;[citation needed]facing a giant turtle;[citation needed]or most importantly, on the borderline ofAquilonia, Conan saw one of Mitra's angels who usually appeared to those about to die. The angel of Mitra appeared again to Conan and granted him Mitra's power to stop a priestess of Yog, a demon worshiped inDarfar. The angels of Mitra and the demons of Yog looked on as the two fought. Conan killed the priestess and saw her blood fall to Earth. The blood cursed the land upon which it fell, making that land a place of war and disorder.[citation needed]\nLater, Zukala, a minor god in thetimeofAtlantis, offered to resurrect Bêlit, and her corpse had started to emerge from the sea, but Conan stabbed Zukala.[citation needed]\nIn Shem, Conan was employed by two rich brothers to find the woman Fionqu'a. Little did Conan know that these brothers were the Gamesmen of Asgalun, using him and Fionqu'a in an amusing game of life and death.[citation needed]\nConan encountered Shumash-Shum-Ukin, a time-travelling Babylonian monarch. After an encounter with Xka'Ahk, a serpent demon rival of Set, Shumash-Shum-Ukin declared he would time travel a few thousand years into the future to meet with a carpenter who can perform miracles.[citation needed]\nAyelet remained a staunch ally of King Conan. She later died due to the machinations of animpostorposing asConan's son, Taurus.[citation needed]\nCirca 9,500 BC, 500 years after the time ofKing Conan,Aquiloniahad extended its empire over the western cities of Shem (along withZingara,Argos, andOphir), while the eastern Shemitish tribes (as well asKothandCorinthia) were forced to pay tribute and lend aid in war to Aquilonia.[13]The Shemite countries were treated by Aquilonia as subjected countries.\nAfter the Aquilonians were defeated by theNemedians, turned against the Bossonians whose desertion had caused the defeat, and were finally invaded by thePictsled byGorm, the Shemites seceeded (along Corinthia, following Zingara).[14]\nAfter the fall of the Aquilonian empire, the Glacial Ages came upon Hyboria, forcing theNordicsandCimmerianssouth. In Shem (as well as inBrythuniaandHyperborea), now under Hyrkanian rule, the Nordic-Nemedians broke the back of the invading power. As their western empire was destroyed, the Hyrkanians massacred all unfit slaves and brought the survivors back east.[15]\nThe advance of the glaciers and the birth of theMediterranean Seadrowned Shem[16]during thePost-Hyborian Cataclysmwhich formed the Mediterranean by breaking theStygian Continentfrom the rest of Hyboria.\nThe Shemite stock survived in various people:\nShem in general has a major presence in the trade world of its era. Its entire area contained a vast network of trade routes and the cities prospered from the profits. TheShemitesfocused a bit too much on their land routes, and the coastline was underdeveloped as a result. Assuming naval trade to be a secondary concern, few Shemites bothered to develop port cities and harbors. Among the most famed of its cities are the decadent coastal metropolis ofAsgalunand the desert-city ofAkbitana, a center of steelmaking.[6]\nThe economy was relatively diverse. The fertile regions were famed for their production in fruits, such as grapes and pomegranates. Agriculture in general and animal husbandry were major and prosperous occupations in the area. Local reserves of gold and copper, along with the famed Shemite textiles and pottery, were prized export items. Shemite mercenaries, mainly archers, served in both local and foreign armies.[6]\nThedesertsof Eastern Shem were typically dominated by raiders, the most famed among them being theZuagir. Individual tribes had their own chiefs, but ambitious war chiefs had been known to sometimes unify multiple tribes in massive forces. Their usual targets were traveling caravans, although they occasionally threatened entire cities if they had sufficient numbers.[6]\nOutside of the Shemite city-states, distinct peoples were known among the Shemites:\nCity-dwellers, and nomads were unified in their polytheistic religious practices. Female deities associated with fertility were widely worshiped, the most popular among them beingAshtoreth, Ishtar, and Derketo/Derketa. A few male gods also had large followings, mainlyPteor,Adonis/Tammuz, andBel. Bel was the patron of liars and thieves, and his followers tended to practice related activities.[6]"

She grew up exploring the cosmos by her father's side, taking part in his gambles and games, and learned from him in the process. While the Grandmaster focused on the contests themselves, he used to leave the winnings to Va Nee.[5]Eons before the birth of Va Nee, En Dwi Gast had usurped the mantle of Grandmaster from a fellow Elder of the Universe. When he returned under the alias of theChallengerto reclaim his title in a rematch,[6]the Grandmaster decided to use Va Nee as an ace in the hole. He granted her the power of teleportation, to the extent it derived into the ability to alter people's memories. Under the alias of Voyager, she was sent toEarth, the chosen battleground for the contest, which was plucked away from its place in the Solar System for the purposes of the contest.[5]\nVoyager and her father\nVoyager convened theAvengersat theAvengers Mansion[7]and used her powers to insert herself into their memories,[8][5]making them believe she was Valerie Vector, a beloved founding member of the team who had seemingly perished in battle against theSquadron Sinister'sVictory the Electromagnetic Man. Voyager claimed that this incident had removed her from existence and memory, having spent roughly a decade in a dream-like state outside of reality, and that the Earth's sudden abduction had jolted her back to existence, and with her, people's memories of her. To make her story more convincing, Voyager tied it toArthur Vector,[5]one of the first scientists to devote his work to quantum entanglement, a theory that held that every atomic particle has a twin somewhere linked to it by faster-than-light forces. Claiming to be his daughter, Voyager toldToni Hothat she had gained her powers after causing an accident in his laboratory when she was a child. These powers manifested in the ability to use the lines of quantum entanglement to teleport anywhere on Earth.[8]\nWhile many Avengers expected Voyager to take the lead, she deferred to the Avengers teams' leadersRogue,Falcon, andCitizen V. In preparation for the contest, the Challenger'sBlack Orderbombed the Avengers Mansion by surprise.[2]Voyager saved the heroes in the nick of time, teleporting them to theAvengers Auxiliary Headquarters.[2]When the Grandmaster and the Challenger placed twoPyramoidson different places of Earth for each of their teams to seize, Voyager was tasked with teleporting a group of Avengers to investigate the Pyramoid inRome,Italy, then return and teleport a second team to attend to the Pyramoid in Cusco,Peru.[9]Throughout the Avengers' eventual confrontations against the Black Order and the Grandmaster'sLethal Legion, Voyager continued providing transport.[10]\nVoyager inserted into a memory of the Avengers\nThe final Pyramoid was specifically placed by the Grandmaster in a hospital whereBeastandWaspwere treating the Avengers' long-time butlerEdwin Jarvis, who had collapsed due to an illness shortly before Voyager's arrival.[11]When Voyager arrived to the scene, Jarvis had just woken up, and in horror he exposed the truth, that Voyager had never been an Avenger. Before Beast and Wasp could do anything, Voyager used her teleportation powers to escape with the Pyramoid.[12]Upon arrival at the Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters with the Pyramoid, a weakened Voyager locked herself inside a secure room where no one else could get in, not even the Avengers themselves. Tired of being used as a pawn in her father's games, she planned to use the last Pyramoid to change her position in the board. The Auxiliary HQ was soon attacked by theHulkto claim the Pyramoid on behalf of the Challenger.[5]Voyager witnessed the Hulk's fight against the Avengers from the vault, and became inspired by the heroes' selflessness, determination and heroism.[13]She made the decision to fight for them when the Hulk finally reached the vault, but he swiftly knocked her down before destroying the Pyramoid. The Avengers confronted her afterwards, angry that she had lied to them both verbally and mentally, and she explained the entire situation to them, telling them that the lies were her father's idea, as a means to turn the odds in his favor.[14]\nVoyager and the final Pyramoid\nWhen the Earth started to crumble, Va Nee teleported some of the Avengers to theGrandmaster's Cosmic Game Roomoff-planet on the deduction that the Challenger had sabotaged theWorld-Enginesustaining Earth's condition over her father's cheating. While the Avengers there tried to keep the World-Engine from failing, Voyager transported the Avengers that were freed from stasis byQuicksilver's actions toManhattan, where the Challenger was on a rampage.[15]Even though the Avengers managed to stand up against the villain, Voyager noticed they were growing weary. At Beast's suggestion, Voyager used her powers of memory manipulation to bring forth within every hero the memories of what it meant for them to be an Avenger. This morale boost, combined with a spell cast by theScarlet Witchto augment her teammates' powers gave the heroes the necessary strength to take down the Challenger and put an end to his rampage. Shortly after the Earth was returned to its location in the Solar System,[1]Voyager bid the Avengers farewell and took the Challenger to theFar Shorein hopes to rekindle the kindness he had before being driven mad by his rivalry with the Grandmaster. Before leaving, the Avengers offered Voyager a membership. She declined, but declared that one day she would earn her place in the team. She also vowed to return if the Grandmaster ever threatened Earth again. In the Far Shore, Va Nee had the Challenger shackled in front of screens monitoring the Avengers' subsequent adventures, in hopes they could inspire him like they inspired her.[3]\nVoyager would soon discover that her father and the Challenger's contest jeopardized reality, since their short-lived abduction of Earth unwittingly fulfilled the requisites to break an imprisonment spell confining theGreek goddessNyxand her children, who proceeded to cast a blackout across the universe.[16]After observing Nyx's slaughter ofOlympusand feeling responsible for her indirect role in Nyx's escape, Voyager left the Far Shore to assemble a team of Avengers to stop her from reclaiming the source of her powers, theNight Shards. These heroes were the Hulk, theVision,Spectrum, the Scarlet Witch,Hawkeye,Rocket Raccoon, and the Olympian demigodHercules.[4]During their first encounter against Nyx, Voyager used her powers to scatter her allies to intercept Nyx's children from retrieving the shards, inadvertently throwing herself at the mercy of Nyx.[17]\nPortal Field:Voyager possesses the ability to generate a field surrounding herself that allows her and whomever she wishes to travel instantly along the lines of quantum entanglement, effectively teleporting anywhere.[8]However, using her powers cause strain on Va Nee's body. She can only use her powers a handful of times before she has to rest.[23]Additionally, the strain is proportional to the amount of people she carries. For instance, mass-teleporting roughly twenty people caused her to collapse.[9]Va Nee can also generate portals to teleport people other than herself.[18]\nMemory Manipulation:Va Nee possesses the power to manipulate memories. She can insert herself in people's memories,[5]make them experience remembrances of specific memories,[1]and even fabricate entirely new people such asVictory the Electromagnetic Man.[2]This ability is limited to organic beings, since it couldn't affect a synthezoid such asVision. Any alterations made to the memory of a person fade away if said person is made aware of the alterations' nature as such.[24]"

An outcast among the Olympians, Nyx longed for the peaceful slumber in the darkness before creation. When she noticed that her fellow gods found happiness in the children they bore, she tried to emulate them. Three nights after dreaming of the stillness of her lost slumber, she gave birth of Hypnos.\nHypnos' birth\nLike his mother, Hypnos failed to find a place among the rest of the Olympians, remaining stoic and loyal to Nyx. Hypnos was eventually joined by two more siblings, the twinsApateandDolos. Tensions between Nyx and her offspring, and the Olympians escalated into a war. The combined strength of the Olympians defeated Nyx and her children, andZeussplit the matriarch's soul into threeNight Shards. Afterward, Nyx and her family were cast out into a prison of darkness, sealed by a spell that ensured their imprisonment for as long as theSunshone upon theEarth. Out of her hatred, Nyx manifested Hypno's third sibling,Oizys.[3]\nHypnos and his family remained chained to their prison of darkness until the Modern Age. During a conflict between twoElders of the Universe, theGrandmasterand theChallenger, the Earth was briefly removed from its orbit around the Sun. With the spell of imprisonment broken, Nyx rallied her children against the Olympians. Believing the gods, the mortals and the universe itself to have all been spoiled after an eternity of mistreatment, Nyx set out to recreate the universe to her image, returning everything to a state of empty and pure darkness.[3]When Nyx and her children arrived on Olympus, they slaughtered all the gods present in the scene, including Zeus, whose mind Nyx probed for the whereabouts of the Night Shards.[4]\nHypnos and the rest of his family\nNyx dispatched Hypnos toNightmare's Realm, where The Night That May Yet Be was located, and he besiegedNightmare's castle with an army of the manifestations of sleeping people. However, a group ofAvengershad become aware of Nyx's return, and a portion of the team, theHulk,Rocket Raccoon, andHawkeye, were sent to Nightmare's Realm to intercept Hypnos.[5]Hypnos squirreled away into Nightmare's castle while the heroes confronted his army and managed to obtain The Night That May Yet Be, but he was hunted down by the Hulk. After defeating Hypnos, the Hulk broke his neck and claimed the Night Shard for himself.[2]\nSleep Inducement:Hypnos possesses the ability to release from his hands a dust which induces sleep.[4]"

Seeking refuge from relentless media scrutiny, he retreated into seclusion. However, his solitude was interrupted by an unexpected proposition fromProfessor Andre Thorton. Thorton saw potential in Cornelius's expertise and envisioned his involvement inWeapon X, a clandestine program.[1]\nHe moved to theWeapon X FacilityinAlberta,Canadaand was paired with the talentedDr. Carol Hines, Dr. Cornelius embarked on a ground-breaking mission: to perfect the process of infusingAdamantium, an virtually indestructible metal, into human subjects.[1]Together they scoped out various candidates which included future prominentmutantsCharles XavierandErik Lehnsherr. They found the perfect candidateLogana member ofTeam X. He also took on a assistant namedJohn Sublime, who the Professor did not like, but Dr. Cornelius dismissed seeing him as harmless not knowing his true intentions.[2]A squad of soldiers was dispatched to tranquilize and capture Logan, their mission proving successful albeit requiring a high dosage of tranquilizer. Tasked with refining and implementing the technique, Cornelius was determined to succeed where others had faltered.[1]The adamantium-bonding method, originally conceived byDr. Kenji Oyama, remained dormant until Cornelius meticulously honed it to perfection.[3]They also used the ground breaking work of famed geneticistDr. Nathaniel Essex.[4]When the began experimenting on him they was shocked to discover his remarkable healing ability, this only encouraged their plans to infuse the adamantium.[5][6][7]During his experiments he used aSymbioteto test his healing factor.[8]During atemporal incident,Omega Redtook over his body to torment Wolverine. When he electrocuted Wolverine, it inadvertently allowed a symbiote to possess him, leading the symbiote to attack Dr. Cornelius, who was possessed by Omega Red at the time. However, just as Logan was about to kill Cornelius, he regained control, and Omega Red was expelled back into the time stream.[9]Sometime later, by 1974Billy Junger, began experimenting on himself using the program's facilities to enhance his chances of becoming asuper-soldierbut he was told that he'd long since aged out of being a viable candidate revealing Dr. Cornelius and Dr. Hines working on Logan.[10]\nThrough his efforts, Logan's skeleton became fused with adamantium, marking a pivotal success. However when he woke up he produced claws out of the knuckles of his hands infused with the indestructible metal. He killed one of the scientists much to the shock of Dr. Cornelius.[11][12]After Logan's assault, the Professor disclosed a startling revelation to Dr. Cornelius: Logan was amutant, an immaculate killing instrument, coveted for his lethal potential. Though initially repulsed, Cornelius's insatiable intellectual intrigue eclipsed his aversion, leading him to consent to further experimentation.[13]Despite sedation, Logan lashed out at the Professor after a mind-control experiment. In response, guards fired upon him. Despite this violent episode, both the Professor and Cornelius resolved to persist with their experimentation.[14][15][16]They can manipulating his mind and viewing memories, witnessing the death of aNative American womanat the hand of Sabretooth, they was able to use this rage as a trigger for their new weapon.[17]He worked withPsi-Borgone of the leading psi-manipulator to help control Logan's mind.[18]Anothertemporal incidentoccurred in whichOld Man Loganpossessed his younger self landing in the tank. When Dr. Cornelius and the Professor noticed Asmodeus' Amulet, they shocked him but he was able to grab it and return to the time stream.[19]\nDuring this time, a teenagedGambitinfiltrated the facility with ease, he was sent there to 'Diary of Nathaniel Essex' who Cornelius had in his desk. Inside a bio storage room, he stumbles upon people in stasis, but his discovery triggers the attention of two guards. Before they can apprehend him, a formidable figure emerges: the newly liberated Wolverine. The rogue experiment swiftly neutralizes the guards, allowing Remy to escape with the diary returning it to Mister Sinister.[4]\nThey later Logan was pitted against a pack of wolves as part of their experimentation. Despite the odds, he emerged victorious, decimating the wolves. Dr. Cornelius closely monitored his vital signs throughout the ordeal and found himself impressed by the remarkable readings.[20]Dr. Cornelius successfully engineered a control helmet, enabling them to manipulate Logan's actions and movements as desired, utilizing the equipment with precision.[21]The Professor and Dr. Cornelius required Logan's services, so they dispatched him on a mission toRoanoke,Alberta. Logan ruthlessly eliminated everyone in the town. Upon their arrival, Dr. Cornelius was appalled by the scene, but the Professor deemed it a triumph and ordered everything to be concealed with a fire.[22]Afterward, he was pitted against a formidable bear, which he dispatched with lethal efficiency.[23]They later escalated the experiment by pitting him against the monstrousWendigo, yet he proved his prowess by triumphing over the formidable creature.[24]Later Dr. Cornelius conducted an inspection, only for Logan to awaken abruptly and assail the doctor, stabbing him in the gut, much to the astonishment of the staff.[23]The entire ordeal turned out to be a test orchestrated by the scientists to gauge Logan's loyalty. Despite their expectations, Logan did return, only to launch a ferocious assault on the scientists. In the chaos, he managed to really break free and flee into the wilderness, leaving Dr. Cornelius mortally wounded in the lab.[25]He later reported everyone was dead except Dr. Hines,Malcolm Colcord, and himself.[26]\nWeapon X Program was temporarily shut down by theU.S. Government, Dr. Cornelius and Dr. Hines started working for the Program's cover agency, theU.S. Department of Agriculture.[27]\nYears later, Japanese crimelordMatsu'o Tsurayabaand his cohorts, including former Weapon X scientist Doctor Cornelius, orchestrated the resurrection of the Russian super-soldier Omega Red.[28]Omega Red sought theCarbonadium Synthesizerto stabilize his mutant abilities, a device previously stolen from him byTeam X. Capturing Wolverine and some of his X-Men teammates, Omega Red aimed to extract the Synthesizer's location from Wolverine's memories. Maverick, hired by former Team X liaison MajorArthur Barrington, intervened to thwart Omega Red's plans. Tracking down Sabretooth, another ex-Team X member, Maverick joined forces with the X-Men to confront the villains. In the ensuing conflict, Maverick exacted revenge by ending Cornelius's life.[29]\nDeath of Wolverine & Cornelius"

After 1500 years after Bori's time, the Hybori had a fairly high level of culture.[1]\nThe Hybori population increasing, they conquered and absorbed weaker tribes. They eventually foundedHyperborea the Elder, the first of theHyborian Kingdoms.\nSome Hyborian tribes resisted the lords of Hyperborea the Elder, and moved southwards over hundred of years, probably migrating throughSkull Gate Pass. In the lands of theBorder Kingdom, they encountered and drove westwards the scatteredPictsliving there.[1]\nIn the days when theHyboriansfirst came down from theNorth,Thanusfounded the land ofOphir, united all of the warlords of Ophir and became its first king.[7]Given the problematic assertion that Ophir was an early Hyborian kingdom while it appears that the Hyborians would likely not have reached Ophir this early, it is possible that Thanus was the founder of post-AcheronOphir, setting him circa 13,000 BC, rather than before the domination of Ophir byOld Stygiaor Acheron.\nOphir was possibly one of the earliestHyborian kingdom. Though the scope of the claim was contested on the basis that Ophir was set far from theHybori's homeland in the North, the assertion that Ophir became a Hyborian kingdom at a very early date was confirmed.[8]\nDue to the statement that theHyborian KingdomsofKoth, Ophir, andCorinthia\"regained their independence with thefall of the empire\" ofAcheron, a theory asserted that those three kingdoms may had not been founded by theHyborians(unlikely to have dominated those kingdoms at the dawn of Acheron), but by refugees fromValusia,Thurania, andZarfhaana, rebuilding their culture while the Hyborians were still in the Far North.[9]\nHyperborea the Elder was eventually destroyed byAesirinvaders.[1]\nBy theAge of Conan, circa 10,000 BC, the Hybori had merged with many other races, and the \"purest strain\" of the original Hyborian stock was found only inGunderland.[1]"

This fortress was named Zahmann after its founder.\nOver the years, the fortress became an independent city-state.[2]\nUnder unrevealed circumstances, the undergrounds of Zahmann came to host theDweller in the Dark, once a man turned into a squid-like monstrosity by theGods.[5]\nBy the Age of Conan, Zahmhan was ruled byQueen Fatima.\nWhenConancame and tried to drink of the springs of Zahmahn, he was approached by aggressive soldiers demanding him to pay tribute to their queen before sating his thirst. In the ensuing fight, Conan slew Fatima's captain and loverYulekbefore being captured and brought to Fatima, who made him her new captain and lover.\nAfter weeks, Conan grew tired but was prevented from leaving on Fatima's orders. Seeking her, he stumbled upon Fatima's handmaiden and slaveYaila, but was soon met with Fatima who believed him to be cheating on her, and sentenced both Conan and Yaila to death by being devoured by theDweller in the Dark. Conan and Yaila managed to escape the Dweller and enter Fatima's room. Conan hurled Fatima into the Dweller's pit, and was acclaimed as a liberator by the people of Zahmann. As Conan hypothesized he could be their king, he was warned that a king would cause the masses to rise in revolt, but was asked to choose them a queen instead.[5]\nYears later,Kulan Gathentranced Yaila and Godrick and posed as their vizier, taking over Zahmann and defeating all who opposed him. ServingKing Strabonusof Koth, Kulan Gath also brought as prisoner a rebel prince,Borrin, against Strabonus. They were followed in Zahmann by a group of Kothian rebels, supporters of Borrin.\nAs Conan returned to Zahmann for an audience with Queen Yaila and Lord Godrick on his way toCimmeria, he was defeated by Kuylan Gath and thrown to the pit, whileHobbofAnupharescaped and was taken by the Kothian rebels who enlisted his help to rescue both Conan and the prince. Conan and Borrin met in Gath's dungeon, and after escaping his binds, slays Borrin at his request. The rebels and Hobb dispatched the captain, but were saved from Gath's magics only by the timely arrival of Conan. When he told of Borrin's death, the rebels refused to believed it, thinking Gath had employed a ruse to lure them into a trap. Gath fled and Yaila's and Godrick's rule resued.[2]\nThe rules applied in Zahmahn were mentioned as the \"Law of Gods and State\".[5]\nZahmann had only queens[5]sinceZahmann's death.[2]\n!-- disputed between Corinthia or \"independent\" -->"

Over the following centuries, thepeople of Starkesborobecame a new breed of Serpent Men who worshiped Sligguth, although their worship remained so secret that even some of its inhabitants remained ignorant of the town's true culture.[10]\nBy theModern Age, nearly all of the town's inhabitants were descended from that original band of settlers. They were one of the few colonies of survivingSerpent-Men.[1]During that era, the town of Starkesboro was the setting of multiple events tied to the surnatural.\nIn modern times, the call of Sligguth caused townsfolk who had moved away to return. In reaction to his fiancéeBethel Doanapparently abandoning him,Ethan Stoddardsought out the help of Doctor Strange. With his intervention, both Sligguth[10]and his fellow demonN'Gabthothwere slain, andShuma-Gorath's awakening delayed, although the still-transformed townsfolk then fled into the dark hills.[11]\nA new generation of business and homeowners took over the abandoned town sometime thereafter. For ten years, the township was economically depressed, until the arrival ofDredmund Druid.[14]Wishing to obtain the power of theMoongemfor himself, Dredmund Druid came to town posing as a self-help guru, holding midnight masses, organizing seminars to attract people and help them \"get in touch with their hairy selves\". He used hypnosis to dominate the inhabitants. His experiments to reconstitute the gem and control its power with the aid ofNightshaderesulted in Starkesboro becoming a town ofwerewolves, both the inhabitants as well as werewolves who felt summoned to the town by the Moongem. A mass of super-heroes including Captain America, Wolverine, and Cable, all following allies and friends afflicted with lycanthropy or similar animal-like alter egos, descended upon Starkesboro and ultimately defeated Druid. This time, the townsfolk were freed from their transformative curse and returned to their normal lives.[13]\nMost recently, Starkesboro, then strong of a population of 15,201,[7]was seen whenDoctor Druidassembled a team ofSecret Defendersto prevent the resurgence ofSloriothin Starkesboro. A powerful and dangerous mystic entity, Slorioth ravaged Earth 15,000 years ago until a cabal of ancient sorcerers bound his body and soul to the land that was later known as Starkesboro, perhaps explaining the small town’s odd attraction of dangerous mystic artifacts.\nDr. Druid has bargained to preserve the life of his lover, Jillian Woods, using one of Slorioth’s talismans, which cost a portion of his soul every time Jillian was temporarily brought back to life as the Darkforce-composed Shadowoman. Corrupted by the loss of his soul, Druid had actually formed the Secret Defenders – using Sepulcre, Cadaver, Deathlok, Drax, and Dagger – to get him past guardians keeping Slorioth imprisoned so that he could release him. They were successful, and Druid used the talisman to unlock Slorioth’s prisoner, releasing him the grounds of Starkesboro.\nFormerly:"

Flourishing, the Brythunians moved southwards and mingled with the ancient people ofZamora, as well as with invading Hybori.[1]\nCirca 10,000 BC, badly wounded from a sword-toothed leopard's attack in the snow-clogged mountain pass toZamora,Conanwas cured and healed by Ahirn and his family, in their humble abode at the foot of the Brythunian mountains. The Cimmerian spent some time helping the farmers, until they were all killed by a band of Zamoran slavers. After killing the slavers, Conan continued on into Zamora.[7]\nHe tried once again to navigate the difficult mountain pass between Brythunia and Zamora, but was pushed back by a flash flood of melted snow. Conan then met Skalla, a Chooser of the Slain who wished to stay among the mortals, but eventually returned toFather Borri, the Grey God. After she left, the Cimmerian tried to climb the pass for the third time.[8]\nMillenia later, the land of Brythunia became the lands of the aristocrats ofPoland.[1]\nBrythunia was one theHyborian Kingdoms, though not a very unified one. A single monarch maintained nominal authority over a large number of autonomous cities and noble domains. The nobility in fact prided itself in being able to restrict royal authority. Brythunians had long tried to establish their country was a regional power, but their lack of unity left them overshadowed by the better-organizedAquiloniaandNemedia.[2]\nThe lineage of the Brythunians is a complex one, and was said to be an admixture of refugees fromHyperborea the Elder,Acheron, completed later byHyborianinvaders and byZamorians, but lacked aboriginal genes.[1]\nFor some reason, the Brythunians were frequent subjects of Hyborian jokes. Their men had been stereotyped as \"thickwitted oafs.\""

Howard,Roy Thomas,Barry SmithFirstConan the Barbarian#3(February, 1971)\nHyperborea the Elder (earlyHyborian Agename)[2][3]\nHyperborea was the name of many countries onEarthacross the ages, from the land from where theDragon KingsruledLemuriaand Earth as a whole, before the rise ofmankind,[1]to theGreekmyth of a people of blonde living way up north.[4]\nThis page is mostly about Hyperborea, the firstHyboriankingdom (then known as Hyperborea the Elder), later conquered byAesir, and visited at times byConanofCimmeriain the course of his adventures during theHyborian Age, circa 10,000 BC.\nHyperborea was a northeastern kingdom, bordered at west byAsgard(presumably separated from it by theRiver of Death Icewhi had its source in theEiglophian Mountains), at south byBrythuniaand theBorder Kingdom, and at east byTuran(a border vaguely delineated by low hills, some lakes, and a small river originated in theGraaskal Mountains).[3]\nElder Hyperborea existed inLemuria, at time where theDragon Kingsruled theEarth.[1]\nThePnakotic Manuscriptswere found back in Hyperborea duringEibon's era.[5]\nTheBook of Eibonwas written by Eibon's apprentice inPre-CataclysicHyperborea.[6]\nAfter theGreat Cataclysm,[7]Hyperborea was originally inhabited by the savagesnow-apes, until savages led byBorirepelled them into theIcy Wastes. That area became the Hyborian homeland.[8]\nThe Hyperboreans were the firstHyboriantribe to discover stonemasonry, and abandoned their primitive nomadic way to settle. The former nomads crafted huge stone-walled dwellings for themselves.[9]Circa 16,000 BC, they founded their barbaric kindom,[10]which began with a crude fortress of boulders that help them repel tribal attacks.[11]\n1500 years afterBori, the Hybori achieved a fairly high culture, and started to conquer and absorb weaker tribes until eventually establishing the first Hyborian kingdom: Hyperborea the Elder.[2]\nThe Hybori tribes who resisted or rebelled against Hyperborea migrated southwards in an invading horde,[2][3]that spilled intoAcheron.[3]\nThe first kingdom of Hyperborea was overthrown by another tribe,[11]theAesir.[12][2][3]The Aesir settled in the ruins, married and bred with the survivors and created a new kingdom,[3]which retained the old name.[11][3]\nLanjauwas the furthest southern outpost of the Hyperboreans, but later found itself into westernCorinthia.[13]\nThe other Aesir and theVanireventually drove out of the snow-countries all the remaining Hyborians except for Hyperborea. Their country was calledNordheim).[11]\nHyperborea suffered imperialistic attacks fromTuran.[14]\nIn the generation before Conan, Hyperboreans tried to subdueCimmeria, only to be hurled back in their land.[15]\nDuring theAge of Conan,Vammatarwas queen of Hyperborea, ruling from her castle ofHaloga.[16]It remains unknown whether or not she was theFinnish goddessVammatar, ahumanhost, a recipient for her power, a poseur, or simply coincidentally shared the same name. She was also allied withLouhi, the witch-queen ofPohiola, an Hyperborean citadel.[17]\nAn ambitious under-king,[18]King Tomarentered war withKing Brian'sBrythunia, to the south. The two kings slew each other, and the Hyperborean god Bori left the Earth plane afterwards.[19]\nCirca 9,500 BC, the Hyrkanians hordes (Hyrkanians and Turanians united under one great chief) stormed the west, sweeping first overZamora, thenBrythunia, Hyperborea, andCorinthia,[20]going around theVilayet Seaby the north, and conquering the kingdom.[3]\nAfter a short age, they were repelled by theNordic-Nemedians, themselves fleeing the invasion of the Cimmerians and Nordics intoNemedia.[20]\nSometime circa 1,300 to 1,100 BC, the Hyperboreans were (to theGreeksandAnatolians) a people of blonds who dwelt\"beyond the North wind\".[4]\nThe realm of Hyperborea contained gloomy mountains, desolate hills, and bleak plains.Wolves,cave bears,reindeer,musk oxen, andmammothsroamed the land,[9]as well asPolar Tigersliving in theWhite Woods.[21]\nThe Hyperboreans were lean, and gaunt with pale skin, and white hair. Their most striking features were their unusual height[3][9]of 7 feet (2,13 meters) and their sparkling, cat-like,[9]greenish eyes.[3]\nThe people of Hyperborea were originallyHyborians. After having invaded, theAesirintermarried with the survivors. Later, by theAge of Conan, through the influx of the slaves, also added genetics fromHyrkanianandZamorianstock.[3]\nClass divisions were rather rigid in Hyperborea. Most commoners were serfs who resided in huts and hovels. They struggled to farm the land and herd cattle in this cold land. The famed stone keeps of Hyperborea were reserved for the ruling class, which mostly consisting of powerful wizards and witches. The local magical organization was theWhite Hand. The Hyperboreans were led by a priestess-queen, living incarnation of their Goddess of Death.\nThough Hyperborean armies seldom ventured far from their borders, the reach of Hyperborea in world affairs was not be underestimated. The rulers trained and employed highly effective assassins, an elite of their age. They took pride in leaving no mark on the bodies of their victims, making their work untraceable. Hyperborean slave raiders plagued the neighboring lands in an effort to provide a cheap labor force for the homeland, resulting in hereditary enmity with various neighbors, includingCimmeria.[9]\nAt the time ofConan, the Hyperboreans worshiped thewar godBorri,[19]and they were led by a priestess-queen, living incarnation of their Goddess of Death[9](This statement could be aboutVammatar, who was both the queen ofHaloga,[16]and a goddess of evil, misfortune,[22]pain and suffering).[23]\nThe oldest god of the Hyperboreans was theelder godBardisattva the Very Old, or Bardis, the god of theCoya clan, while despised by theClan Curgill. TheLand of Bardisattvawas forbidden to all but theSilent Followers, priests of the Coya.[24]\nTheFrozen Riverdelimitated the border withBrythunia.[26]\nAlong the years, Hyperborea lost some of its territory to other nations:"

Howard,Roy Thomas,Barry SmithFirstConan the Barbarian#23(November, 1972)\nEditorial Names:\nSiblings:\nDescendants:\nIrises:\nRed Sonja was born a member of a group of red-haired, bronze-skinned people called the Favored, who were created by the red goddessScathach. These people were granted supernatural strength and skill with weapons for the purpose of slaying the Drommach, flesh-eating man beasts that inhabit the caves of the Favored. In the early days, the red goddess foretold that in the time of their doom, a pale-skinned destroyer would arise from the group, in order to lead them to their final death and everlasting glory. When Red Sonja was born with the prophesized pale skin, her mother concealed her secret using skin dyes for over a year. However, her deceit was eventually discovered; Sonja's parents were killed by the Favored and the young Sonja was left in the caves to be devoured by the Drommach.[9]\nYears later, Red Sonja lived with a new, brown-haired Hyrkanian family in a humble home in the WesternHyrkanian Steppes. During this time in the land of humans, the goddessScathachkept Sonja weak and weaponless until her will was enacted. When she had just turned 17 years old, a group of cruel mercenaries killed her fatherIvor, her mother and two younger brothers and burned their house and all their possessions. She survived but at the cost of her own virginity after she was brutally raped by the leader of the group, leaving her in shame. Seeing that Scathach's will that Sonja should see her loved ones die and be raped by men was fulfilled, she then appeared to her. Scathach intended for Sonja's pain and rage to forge her into a warrior, and she finally removed the shackles of Sonja's natural-born strength and skill with a weapon on the condition that she would not allow herself to be loved by another man unless he defeated her in fair combat.[10][9]\nThe next two or three years of Red Sonja's career are scarce. During this period, she honed her prowess at the blade, and became a sell-sword for the city-states ofHyrkania, and it's possibly during those years that she slayed the evil wizardKulan-Gath(destined to return later).[11]\nEventually Red Sonja was hired byGhannifthe King ofPah-Dishahwho sent her leading a troop to the city ofMakkalet,[11]where she came acrossConan the Barbarian. Sonja assisted Conan in defeatingThe Vulture,[4]and afterwards they worked together to steal theSerpent Tiarafrom the King of Makkalet, fulfilling her mission for the King of Pah-Dishah. Although Sonja promised Conan a reward for his assistance, she left Makkalet once she recovered the tiara.[12]\nUpon her return to Pah-Dishah, Red Sonja faced treachery as the King took the tiara from her and made her a prisoner. The King planned to make Sonja part of his harem, but that night, Sonja murdered the King and his close guards. Sonja escaped Pah-Dishah and rode west until she arrived toThe Maul, where she met with Conan once again. Reunited, Conan and Sonja worked together to stop an undead being,[13]but they were soon chased from the city by bounty hunters, who were seeking Red Sonja for the murder of the king.[14]Their escape led Conan and Sonja to the hideout of a couple of vampires, who made the adventurers their prisoners. The vampires planned to feed from them, but Conan managed to trick them into releasing him, allowing Conan and Red Sonja to escape and burn their hideout, killing the vampires inside. After escaping a certain death, Red Sonja knocked Conan unconscious and continued on her own path, leading danger away from the Barbarian.[15]\nMuch later, Sonja and Conan met again and confronted the evil sorcererKulan Gath.[2]\nRed Sonja also went to the future on two separate occasions when she possessedMary Jane Watsonand teamed up withSpider-Manin defeating Kulan Gath who had also traveled to the future in one of many attempts to take over modern day Earth.[1]\nAccording to a tale, years later, King Conan ofAquiloniaran into Red Sonja in a tavern inTarantia, and was taunted into joining her, into another adventure, aboard a small boat on theKhoratas River, overtaking a death barge. Red Sonja plundered a gem from a corpse in the hold and Conan an elaborated golden amulet. Arriving late and without any gift tohis daughter's birthday party, Conan offered the amulet. Given Red Sonja should be sixty by then, and appeared in her prime, it is possible that Conan had too much to drink and that he shared this adventure with someone else.\nRed Sonja's previous and subsequent adventures remains unknown."

It finally slaughtered Khurusan before vanishing.[1]\nThe village becameStregoicavar(which could be translated as \"Witch Town\"), an unknown village in the mountains ofHungary.\nThere was only one monolith, broken at top and known as theBlack Stone, by the time theHunsled byAttilapassed this way.\nNear the stone was built a castle, still there in ruins in more recent days, and which was seemingly involved when theTurks, under the  rule ofSuleiman the Magnificent, swept over EasternEurope.[2]\nThe locals were afraid of the Black Stone, with rumors mentioning people losing their minds when approaching it on mid-summer night, witnessing obscene visions. TheGermaneccentricVon Junztdescribed the Stone, stated to be an object of worship of an ancient fertility cult, in his \"Black Book\",[2]also known asUnausprechlichen Kulten[3](\"Nameless Cults\").\nJustin Geoffrey, anAmericanpoet, visited the Stone, and was rendered mad by it, though he saw it by daylight."

They were not all killed, for the Beast-Men were shrewd. From their captives, they learned of weapons. They also found out that humans made good workers. In order to perpetuate their stock of slaves, they went on the edges of the ice-wastes to kidnap human females.\nLater, they found an abandoned city built by some earlier long-race of men, and established the subterranean city ofBrutheim, in theLand of Always-Light, underAesgaard[7]andVanaheim.[4]\nIn theAge of Conan, many populations of Snow-Apes existed: theVendhyansnow ape,[5]theHimeliansnow ape,[6]the snow-apes hunting the mountains around theVilayet Sea.[4]Thegigantopithecansnow-apesofPathenia.[9]As the \"Desert Man\", the snow-ape also haunted thelost plateau country of Loulan.[4]\nConantheCimmerianencountered the Beast-Men while in Aesgaard.

The length of chain was wrapped around the stake, and onlookers would gamble on whether or not the creature would realize it could unwind the chain and thus reach would-be victims – mostly young maidens – cast into the pit.[6]\nApart from his dealing of the Beast-Men of Brutheim, Conan was often confronted to Snow-Apes in his adventuring life:"

At the height of his power, he could lay waste to areas of 0.862 miles in diameter and emit plasma over a range of 3.17 miles while generating a level 7 force shockwave. Gemini's power was markedly reduced byRune's energy theft, and his area of destruction was reduced to 42.67 yards in diameter. Gemini could also create plant and animal life, even human beings. He could levitate and heal at superhuman rate, but this also exhausted his energy stores.\nFrom Rune's bite he developed a thirst for human flesh and blood, which could restore his power more quickly than consumption of normal food. He could assume a Rune-like form, complete with wings, claws, and retractable fangs, and could drain power from others by biting them.\nEventually the powers split, with Noel harnessing the energy powers and Erik possessing the Rune-like form and powers. The two made an agreement with Noel controlling the form during daylight and Erik doing so during night time. As Erik became increasingly bloodthirsty, Noel imposed a limitation on him, preventing him from consuming innocents; however, this had the effect of costing him his own conscience, and he became increasingly hostile towards humanity, seeking to punish the guilty and not really caring if innocents were killed in the process."

Previously the High Priestess ofGarokk, the Petrified Man, Zaladane often fought the heroKa-Zarfor command of the Savage Land.[1]She later served theHigh Evolutionary[2]before conquering the Savage Land for herself. As Empress of the Savage Land, Zaladane briefly stole the powers from her alleged sisterPolaris.[3]She was ultimately killed byMagnetoafter an attempt to control the earth's magnetic field.[4]\nZaladane was the high priestess ofPetrified Man, the sun god worshiped by the Sun People. She led her people in a war in Garrok's name to conquer more of the Savage Land. However, an unnamed British sailor five centuries ago had visited the Savage Land and drank a strange liquid there that endowed him with immortality and superhuman powers. Over the centuries it also slowly gave him the physical appearance of the stone-like Garrok. Returning to the Savage Land, he proclaimed himself to be the god Garrok and used his powers to destroy the weapons of Zaladane's army, thereby ending the war. Shortly thereafter Garrok died after having been immersed in the liquid that had given him his powers.[1]\nZaladane claimed that her real name was Zala Dane and that she was the sister ofLorna Dane, the mutant Polaris. It is not known how Zaladane came to live in theSavage Land, a prehistoric tropical jungle existing on the Antarctic continent, nor how she became queen and high priestess of theSun People, one of the many races inhabiting the Savage Land.\nMany months later, Zaladane painted the chest of a captive namedKirk Marstonwith oil made from the Petrified Man's ashes, causing Marston to transform into the Petrified Man, whose consciousness supplanted Marston's. Zaladane then became Garrok's principal aide as he attempted to bring peace to the Savage Land by forcing its people to live in a city he had constructed. However, the jungle lordKa-Zarand theX-Menwrecked their plans.[5]\nYears later, Zaladane became the assistant of the superhuman being called theHigh Evolutionaryin his successful effort to restore the Savage Land after its destruction by the alienTerminus. Zaladane allied herself with theSavage Land Mutates, Savage Land natives who had been given superhuman powers through artificially induced mutation.[2]\nFollowing the High Evolutionary's departure Zaladane amassed an army of Savage Land natives, who were mentally controlled for her by the Savage Land Mutate namedWorm. She then had Lorna Dane abducted and brought to the Savage Land. Zaladane then stole Lorna's superhuman powers over magnetism and infused them into her own body. Ka-Zar and members of the X-Men battled and defeated Zaladane and her forces. Her army was released from Worm's control and Lorna regained her freedom. Sometime later she regained her magnetic powers.[3]"

She also gave him an armlet with strange runes (stating it would protect him). The party, led byKhurusan, was asked by the queen to perform a rite at theBlack Monoliths of Xuthltan, towards the God With No Name. There, they were warned byJustin the Blind Hermitabout summoning the god. The soldiers stabbed him, and the Hyrkanian leader of the party sacrificed his men,Yaar AliandAkhaan, as well as Justin's daughter, causing the return of the monstrous toad-thing.\nThe thing relentlessly attacked Conan, who understood that it was drawn to the armlet. Conan consequently threw the trinket at Khurusan. The Hyrkanian caught the armlet, and was promptly attacked by the thing, that left immediately afterwards into the black smoke-whirls that manifested from the Monoliths.[1]\nThe Black Monoliths of Xuthltan became known as the Black Stone, a single monolith, nearStregoicavar(who could be translated as \"Witch Town\"), in the mountains ofHungary, and was mentioned inVon Junzt'sBlack Book,[2]theNameless Cults.[4]\nAllegedly, many curious came to witnessed the black monolith, and died madmen because of what they saw. None of those stories were verified, apart from the American poetJustin Geoffrey, who came to witness the Black Stone, and possibly stared at it too long, even if it was only in day-time. Geoffrey died screaming in a mad-house five years later."

Howard,Roy Thomas,Barry SmithFirstConan the Barbarian#5(May, 1971)\nEyeballs:\nIrises:\nZuakala was an allegedly ageless sorcerer who claimed to be the last of a once-proud race, and to be older thanAtlantis. He wore a full-face mask, which was the source of his powers.\nAt some point, Zukala had a daughter,Zephra, who could change into a feline, see the future, and who was seemingly ageless like her father.[4]\nFrom his castle, Zukala was the master much ofZamora,[5]and forced a remote village, which he considered to be his subjects, to pay him, by right of power, a tribute of forty gold pieces per year in taxes.\nConan was in the village the day of the due during a year the village did not pay. He witnessed Zephra in cat-form come to collect the gold and terrorize the villagers. The two clashed, and Zephra returned home exhausted. Zukala consequently summoned thedemonJaggta-Nogato collect the tribute or kill the villagers. Conan, hired by the villagers to deal with Zukala, infiltrated his lair at that moment, but stumbled into Zephra who revealed her love for Conan. Zukala intervened, but Conan managed to break his mask,[4]scaring his face in the process.[5]Zephra tried to prevent the fighting, causing Conan to offer to leave in exchange for the price he was paid by the villagers. Zukala refused, and tried to have Zephra in cat-form rip Conan apart, but she refused. As Jaggta-Noga returned, Zukala issued the same order, but Zephra intervened, prompting Zukala to order the demon to kill both his daughter and Conan. Jaggta-Noga defeated Zephra, causing Zukala to banish the demon. He then issued a last threat towards Conan before leaving with his daughter.[4]\nZukala and Zephra relocated inKoth, reclaiming an abode from the wilderness. His mage-mask broken, Zukala lost much of his powers, and all of his youth, while Zephra could no longer turn into a tiger, and would age naturally.\nZukula served theLord Arkynand theLords of Law, opposingXiombarg, Queen of theChaos-Swords. Seeing the arrival of Conan, he sent forth Zephra to meet with him, but she was targeted by Xiombarg'sHooded Ones. He enlisted Conan (without mentioning the Lords of Law) to preventKulan-Gathfrom reaching the tomb ofTerhali, the Green Empressof the world ofMelniboné, whose tomb in the city ofYagalahad been projected inHyboria. Zephra accompanied Conan in his quest.\nPreoccupied by his daughter's safety, Zukala attempted to spy on Xiombarg using his powers, but his tentative was spotted. Soon, Conan and Zephra crossed path withElric of Melniboné, another enemy of Xiombarg, and the trio were attacked by Xiombarg'sChaos Pack, led byPrince Gaynor the Damned. Zephra called her father for help as she invokedSerusha, Goddess of rain and driving storm, conjuring a storm upon her hellish enemies who fell under the cleansing waters.[5]\nZukala used again his power to witness the party arriving at theSighing Lake, where was set Yagala. They encountered Kulan-Gath, but Gaynor and the Chaos Pack intervened, leaving Kulan-Gath free to resurrected Terhali. To oppose her, Arkyn used Zephra as her host, despite Zukala's protests, who knew that she would not survive Arkyn's power. Zephra, invested with Arkyn's power, destroyed Terhali before dying.\nConan returned Zephra's body, covered in Elric's cloak, to Zukala, who offered him his friendship, but Conan politely rejected it before leaving.[6]Zukala eventually came to blame Conan for his daughter's death.[1]\nZukala wandered far until he came toAkkhariawhere his knowledge made him the right-hand man toKing Sumuabi. Eventually,Karanthes, the last priest ofIbis, came to the city and stole first the semblance, then the actual power of Zukala, and ultimately replaced him as he was driven out of the city on Sumuabi's orders. Zukala consequently plotted Karanthes' death. Zukala went to live in a temple nearGhaza,Shem.\nEight years after meeting Conan for the last time, Zulka appeared as a spirit, offering him wealth and women if he was to go to his dwelling and cast his mystic runes, and threatening him if he refused. Conan rejected the offer. Later, Zukala appeared again, offering to restore to life Conan's lost soulmate.Bêlit, in exchange of Conan bringing Karanthes to Zukala.\nZukala possessed great power, though most of it was originated from his mage-mask,[4]and were lost or diminished after its breaking. He could use his own blood to perform some of his powers.[5]\nHis powers were derived into his daughter, though with their weakening, they couldn't power her.[6]"

Burgun tried to duel Conan but was unable to reach. Venarium fell, and he  left the Aquilonian army.[1]\nHe later became a captain among theCorinthians. He became interested with a rich girl who saw him only as a wanderer or a mere soldier.\nAfter Conan made himself a fugitive fromNemedia, they contacted Corinthia (the two countries being in treaty) to have him killed. Burgun's troop (includingAri) was sent to catch him, but were trapped and killed by Conan. Escaping the trap, Burgun confronted Conan, recalling him of Venarium, but was easily defeated by Conan, who though to have killed him and left him for dead.\nBurgun tracked Conan into the treasure-crypt ofLanjau, but the two agreed to cease hostilities and rather focus on the treasure at hand. Debating on the sharing, both wishing to take a gems-encrusted jade serpent statue and live the rest of the riches to the other one. The deal was settled using cubes (dices), and Conan took the serpent. Burgun took his share with the intent of deserting Corinthia and seduce the rich girl. They were attacked by the keepers of the treasure-crypt, mummified soldiers. They were able to escape them, and when the keepers went outside tracking them, they were exposed tosun-light and turned to dust. An earthquake immediately shacked the city. Conan was able to flee the city and save himself, and believed Burgun had perished. His very name then vanished from Conan's memory, who tried to retrieve it in vain.[1]Similarly, Burgun thought Conan had died.[2]\nBurgun returned and found the girl he wished to marry already wed, and drunk himself down for a month, until he spent all of his treasure.\nHe became a thief, partnering withIgon. Operating in a Corinthian city-state, he was chased by the guards led byCaptain Aron, and used to hide in theTemple of Anu, which priest took a part of their treasures in exchange for sanctuary.\nOne night, Conan andJennaarrived in the city. Without recognizing him, Conan helped Burgun escape. With Igon, the three took refuge in the Temple of Anu, where Conan and Burgun finally recognized each others. Conan suggested to loot but was confronted to the summonedBull of Anu.\nThe next night, Conan and Burgun committed a few heists and evaded Captain Aron's interventions. Gurdun then decided that the next robbery would be against theRed Priest, Nabonidus, the real ruler of the city, behind the puppet king. There, Burgun took golden skulls but Conan suspected sorcery and took only a dagger-belt.\nEnraged, Nabonidus pressured Aron who went to press at his turn on the priest of Anu, along with a bribe of his own, to have the guards wait for the thief at the Temple. Conan and Burgun walked right into the trap, and Burgun ordered Conan to flee while he was himself captured. While Igon wasn't inclined to assist him, Conan had littleGordato spy on the palace's prison in order to rescue Burgun, but the execution was not done three days later like it was usually for the thieves, but way sooner, and Conan watched powerless to Burgun's hanging.\nAfter causing the death of the priest by the Bull of Anu, Conan went to retrieve Burgun's body, setGallows-square / \"Thieves' end\", the hanging place, on fire and buried his friend outside the city.[2]"

Elaborating Essex's experiments, theU.S. Governmentthen started a secret program designed to create super-soldiers that could be used by the military, recruiting Thorton into the so-calledWeapon Plus Program.[6]\nProject: Rebirth, which originated the first American super-soldier,Captain America, was retroactively brandedWeapon I,[9]but the later incarnations, from Weapon II to Weapon IX, will not be as successful as the original.[6]It is known that in 1945 Thorton was in charge of a Weapon Plus operation located in the basement ofRavencroft Institutein theUpstate New York, where he andCount Draculawere trying to cure theVampiresof their weaknesses.[10]\nIn the 1960s, Weapon Plus and theC.I.A.co-sponsored the formation of a secret black-ops squad namedTeam Xand composed ofmutantssuch asWolverine,Sabretooth,Maverick,Kestrel,Mastodon, andSilver Fox. Professor Thorton acted as the main Weapon Plus liaison to the team, also being the head scientist in charge of the operatives' continuous brainwashing.[5]\nSome years later after Team X disbanded, criminal mastermindRomulus, who already had connections with both C.I.A. and Weapon Plus during the Team X years,[11]had the agency sponsoring the tenth iteration of Weapon Plus,[1][12]codenamedWeapon X. Likely under Romulus' orders,[1]Professor Thorton was then appointed Director of the Weapon X Program.[6]\nFollowing Romulus' orders,[12]Thorton's Weapon X agents captured former Team X agent Logan, codenamedWolverine, to be the program's first subject, theExperiment X.[2]After the initial phases of the experiment,[13]Thorton and his collaborators found a way to project Logan's thoughts into a screen, observing the clash between Logan and Sabretooth which took place after Logan's former love, Silver Fox, was killed by Sabretooth.[14]\nThorton and his team took advantage of Logan's false memories implanted by the C.I.A. during his time as a Team X operative, setting up awarehouseinOntario,Canada, where new false memories would have been filmed through cinematographic sets and special effects and implanted in the minds of Logan and his former teammates, which were either contacted ot captured by Weapon X Program.[15]Some time later, Thorton recruited psycho talentAldo Ferroin order to implant the fabricated memories directly with his psychic powers, avoiding spending resources and money on building set scenarios.[16]\nWhen Logan successfully broke free of this programming and escaped thefacility,[17]the program was temporarily shut down and put under the coverage ofU.S. Department of Agriculture's \"Pest Control Section\", of which Thorton was appointed director.[15]In the following years, Thorton continued to run the Weapon X Program training the remaining agents, includingMaverick, untilJohn Sublime, the former assistant ofDr. Abraham Cornelius(the chief scientist at Experiment X), which had been promoted to the Weapon Plus Program, notified him that his superiors had decided to ultimately shut down Weapon X. Thorton instead broke all the ties between his program and Weapon Plus, having Weapon X completely funded by U.S. Department of Agriculture.[6]"

In those days,Argellowas a great man and a hero of Poitain, but also murdered his wife in cold blood in a jealous frenzy.[5]\nDuring theAge of Conan, circa 10,000 BC, theDevourer of Soulsteleported to Poitain to seduce the most beautiful and unspoiled maiden in the western kingdoms and sacrifice her untoXuthl. He created a mortal vessel for himself called Acheron, hiding the Devourer’s body in a sepulcher beneath the manor he had taken possession of. MeetingCount Trocero, Baron of the province of Poitain, Acheron was presented to Trocero's daughterSephra. Over the next few weeks Acheron began his seduction of Sephra, proceeding apace with the girl falling in love with the Devourer’s human guise; however, the Devourer soon discovered himself falling in love with the girl as well. Sephra's father refused to allow her to see Acheron any longer. Serphra then snuck out of her father's castle and met with Acheron, who was debating abandoning his life as the Devourer altogether. Just as they revealed their feelings to one another, Xuthl blasted the girl into a blackened skeleton and charred meat, driving the Devourer insane. Acheron took an axe from the wall and proceeded down into the crypt, fully intending to slay his demonic half and sever his ties with his dark past forever.Conanand his allies arrived at the manor outside and battled their way through an army of skeletal warriors. They made their way to the catacombs beneath the manor, while Conan and the mentally unbalanced Devourer squared off in a titanic battle that carried them across worlds.[6]\nAfter he was crowned King ofAquilonia, Conan returned to Poitain withPublioto visit Trocero and his new brideEvlena, whom he helped get rid of a cursed ring, which was forcing her to attempt assassinating her husband. Conan eventually turned the ring against her former suitor,Rovlok, who gave it to Evlena, jealous of her relationship with Trocero. Rovlok was then killed by a summoned mist-likedemon.[5]"

Four of the titles were cancelled before 1969, with all Marvel content being removed from the remaining title, Smash! from March 15th 1969, but the short lived success of the Power Comics ultimately led to Marvel creatingMarvel UKas a British outlet, initially dedicated primarily to reprint titles.\nWhile 'Alf', 'Bart' and 'Cos' clearly based their editorial style heavily on that of Stan Lee, in the early issues Marvel's contribution to the Power Comics line was barely acknowledged. This was rectified as more Marvel reprints began to appear, however. Several issues carried full colour pin-ups of various Marvel characters on the back covers, drawn byBarry Windsor-Smith.

Cashing in the last of his official government favors, Langkowski had Nemesis brought to an oldDepartment Hlab. There he injected her with nano-technology and attached a device to her spine. He used these means to control the otherwise erratic and potentially dangerous Nemesis. Should she attempt to harm an innocent, or dislodge the device, she would be flooded with neo-floxins that would be capable of permanently severing her connection to the Soul Sword. Since it was the sword that gave the otherwise dead Nemesis life, this could prove to be fatal. Joining Walter Langkowski's new Alpha Flight, Nemesis took part in the rescue of the old members from the Plodex. After they decided to transport the remaining Plodex eggs to their homeworld, the new team decided to stay together to protect Canada.[2]\nWhen Alpha Flight's old foeFlashbackcame to them for help, he explained how he was running out of time. Years ago in a battle with Madison Jeffries, one of Flashback's future selves was killed. He swore off super-villainy, burned his costume, and hoped to avoid his fate. When his \"inverted\" costume appeared in his bathroom, and suddenly found himself dressed in it, he knew his time was running short. Contacting Alpha Flight, he asked them to travel back in time and alter the past to prevent his death. Rather than simply doing this, Langkowski decided they might as well fix a few things while they were at it, and preventGuardian's near death experience. Nemesis was the hinge in this plan, as she had time traveling capabilities locked in her sword. Needing a blood connection from the time they planned to visit, Nemesis ran her sword through Flashback, killing him. She reasoned that any death that should happen would be undone when the past was \"fixed\". One by one Nemesis \"killed\" the members of Alpha Flight to send them to the past, each time messing up the timeline even more. As the last straw, she ran herself through to see if she could herself fix time. In the end, Alpha Flight managed to get things back on track (more or less), saved Flashback and restored the timeline. Since then all that has been seen of Nemesis was a glimpse into the possible future where she was dead side-by-side with her lost love,Rutherford Princeton.[3]\nNemesis is the living embodiment of the spirit of retribution; the full extent of her abilities were never stated. Being technically \"dead\", Nemesis' body continues to function purely as a result of her physical connection to theScell."

It is known by different names by different pantheons and cultures. Currently known as theFar Shore, it is a realm of unbeing where there is neither time nor space. It stands apart from the personifications of existence, and is thus outside the range of their influence.[5]\nTheMultiversessprang from a void of nothingness and eventually return to it. However, this is not truly the end as it will eventually be reborn as part of anongoing cycle. This has happened many times.[16]\nThecosmic entityknown asOblivionembodies the void, as well as other entities like theChaos King.[16][17][18]Various beings were exiled there throughout the years, including theFirst Firmament, theChallenger, andThanos.[8][6][5]It is the edge of theMystery.[5]\nGinnungagap\nTheGinnungagap, orYawning Void, was the place where the two primordial forces of fire, which was born inMuspelheim, and ice, which first emerged inNiffleheim, first came together to create life as it is.[19]\nTheRøkkvawas a primordial antilife entity spawned near the beginning of the universe from a piece of theAnti-All.[20]It roamed the cosmos and mindlessly destroyed or corrupted everything it came across, but was imprisoned in a tomb deep in the Barren Mountains ofJotunheimwith theAll-FathersofAsgardguarding it.[21]\nThe darkelder godKnulldwelled in and ruled over the primordial void known as the Abyss, which existed between the destruction of the sixth iteration of the universe and the creation of the seventh.[22]When theCelestialsintruded and began creating the universe; Knull was enraged and created theSymbiotesand other antilife entities by grantinglife to the abyssin order to destroy everything and return the universe to the void.[11]Knull proclaimed himself to be theVoidincarnate,[23][22]thoughMarvel Girldetermined that while Knull was the God of the Abyss, the Darkness from which he originated and drew his powers long-predated him.[24]\nThe night goddessNyxexisted before the rise of theOlympiansand the creation of the universe, and vowed to bring an eternal night on the universe.[4]\nTo theXian,Yuanshi Tianzun, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, emerged from \"Wuji,\" the primordial nothingness, as a result of the merging of the pure breaths of the Earth MotherGaea(\"Yin\") and theDemiurge(\"Yang\").[15]\nTheEnneadwere born from the chaos-seaNun (Demiurge). Nun as both a god and as the Primordial Chaos continues to exist alongside the cosmos, which must be continually maintained to prevent it collapsing back into chaos.[25][26][verification needed]\nAccording to Shinto cosmology, the dark entity known asAmatsu-Mikaboshiresided within the formless dark world later known asEarth, beforeIzanagiand Gaea transformed the endless void into the islands ofJapanand began populating it. As punishment for attempting to destroy their creations, Mikaboshi was forced to descend toYomi.[27]In truth, \"Amatsu-Mikaboshi\" was an offshoot ofOblivionembodying the void that existed before the creation of the universe, but was weakened by the emergence ofEternityand co-opted into the Shinto pantheon, further constraining it for untold eons until it was able to regain its true form and power.[28]\nManitou, theSky Fatherof theManidoog, emerged from Giizhigong into an endless void of nothingness. He created the elements of rock, fire, wind and water. However when he created light his shadow became sentient becoming the beingKhLΘG. He wished to destroy all that Manitou had created. Manitou took away his physical form and banished him into the nothingness.[27]\nThe demon known as theBeastresided in the endless cold darkness, until the rise ofhumanityto which he saw them as a corruption.[29]\nWhen theSeventh Cosmoswas destroyed as a consequence of theincursions,[30]Doctor Doomused the power he stole from theBeyondersto createa new realityfrom its remnants.ThanosofTitanwas one of the survivors of the oldMultiversewho managed to make their way to said reality.[31]He defied Doom and was killed for it.[32]His soul, however, didn't go to any afterlife. It was instead sent to the Far Shore, where Thanos remained exiled even after the Multiverse was brought back as theEighth Cosmos. Eventually, Thanos witnessed asGalactusarrived in the Far Shore to save theUltimates, who had exited the Multiverse in order to fix time, which they thought was broken. With his mission complete, Galactus returned to the Eighth Cosmos, unaware that Thanos had followed him through the portal he opened.[8]\nAfter being shattered into pieces in the final conflagration of theCelestial War, theFirst Firmament, personification of theFirst Cosmos, escaped to the Far Shore in order to survive. From there, he watched as new, collective entities born from his substance replaced him and one another as embodiments of everything that is. Growing resentful for being substituted with beings he considered inferior to him, the First Firmament waited millennia for the right moment to try to reclaim his position. That moment came whenEternity, one of the two entities who represented the Seventh Cosmos, was left weak in the wake of hisrebirthas the Eighth Cosmos.[6]\nNothing dies!\nUnbeknownst to all,the manifestations of previous Multiverseswere still alive, waiting for Eternity's call for help against the First Firmament in the Far Shore. Upon learning that, Eternity called on them and they were able to defeat the First Firmament before he could exact his plan.

They were joined by other gods into forming theOlympians. Nyx became an outcast within her people, harboring a disdain for the Olympians' pageantries. When Nyx noticed the other gods had children which made them happy, she tried to emulate them. Three days after dreaming of the darkness and its stillness, Nyx gave birth toHypnos, the God of Sleep.\nWith the evolution of mankind, the night and the dark became correlative to the unknowns humanity feared. Mortal storytellers used their words to dispel these terrors and find comfort in heroes of myth, shaping Zeus and his children into these ever-growing heroes, causing Nyx to become their opposite. With each legion of followers the Olympians gained, both Nyx's rage and the Olympian's contempt for her grew stronger. Following another dream with her mind filled with thoughts of betrayal, Nyx gave birth to the twinsApateandDolos, the Gods of Deceit and Trickery, respectively. Nyx came to be known to other pantheons, such as theAsgardians, and wanting to be on her good side, All-FatherOdingifted her a mystical horse.[1]\nNyx and her children imprisoned\nConflict between Nyx and her children and the Olympians became inevitable. When a war broke out, Nyx and her children were defeated by the rest of the Olympians. Zeus shattered Nyx's soul into threeNight Shardsto depower her, and then cast her out along with her children into a prison of darkness, ensuring their confinement with a spell that sealed their fate for as long as theSunshone upon theEarth. Out of her hatred, Nyx manifested her fourth and most powerful child,Oizys, the Goddess of Misery.\nNyx and her children remained chained to their prison of darkness until the Modern Age. During a conflict between twoElders of the Universe, theGrandmasterand theChallenger, the Earth was briefly removed from its orbit around the Sun. With the spell of imprisonment broken, Nyx rallied her children against the Olympians. Believing the gods, the mortals and the universe itself to have all been spoiled after an eternity of mistreatment, Nyx set out to recreate the universe to her image, returning everything to a state of empty and pure darkness.[9]Nyx's return was heralded by the sudden blackout of every source of light in the universe, including the stars themselves.[3]When Nyx and her children arrived onOlympus, they slaughtered all the gods present in the scene, including Zeus, whose mind Nyx probed for the whereabouts of the Night Shards.[10]\nNyx's return to the universe was sensed byVoyager, the daughter of the Grandmaster, who then observed the Olympian massacre. Realizing that her father's scheme had facilitated the freedom of the Queen of Night, she assembled a group ofAvengersto stop Nyx, includingHercules, the son of Zeus. When these heroes reached Olympus, they stumbled into the massacre of gods,[3]and Nyx returned to confront the heroes with Oizys while the rest of her children went to retrieve the Night Shards. The heroes' efforts to fight Nyx and Oizys were futile, and the Queen of Night enchanted theScarlet Witch's eyes to see through them as her own in the process. After sensing the location of Nyx's children, Voyager split the Avengers and teleported them to the two locations,Omnipotence CityandNightmare's Realm, inadvertently leaving herself to Nyx's clutches.[10]\nNyx claiming a Night Shard\nWhile Apate and Dolos were fighting the Avengers at Omnipotence City, Nyx appeared and claimed the first shard, the Night That Was fromLord Librarian.[9]Before Nyx could deduce how to access the shard's power once more, the heroes caused a diversion that resulted in Voyager teleporting the Scarlet Witch away with the shard to theHyborian Age. When Nyx telepathically checked up on Hypnos's progress at Nightmare's Realm, she witnessed her son's death at the hands of theHulk, who took the Night Shard there, The Night That May Yet Be, for himself. In anger, Nyx lashed out against Hercules and theVision,[2]accidentally killing Apate and Dolos instead sinceSpectrumhad used her powers to turn herself into a holographic shell that disguised Vision and Hercules as the twins and vice versa.[11]\nIn the Hyborian Age, the Scarlet Witch went on a journey with the local barbarianConanto retrieve the Night Shard, accidentally summoning Nyx when she touched the shard.[12]Spectrum lifted Hercules and Vision's disguises and the combined forces of the heroes tried to stop Nyx. With the shard in hand, the Queen of Night eventually realized she needed to destroy it to gain its power. Doing so empowered Nyx, bind her to the other fragments, and caused her to catch a glimpse of a mysterious house in a vision. Nyx teleported herself back to the present to find the final shard, leaving Oizys to deal with the Avengers,[11]though she would meet her end instead.\nIn the present, Nyx arrived on the living planetEuphoria, where the Hulk's group was searching the last shard. After forcing the Hulk to transform back into Bruce Banner, Nyx took the power of the Night Shard he had absorbed, once again causing her to catch a glimpse of the mysterious house.[13]The Avengers left in the Hyborian Age followed Nyx, but their confrontation against the Queen of Night was interrupted by the corporeal manifestation of Euphoria. Since the warring between the Avengers and Nyx threatened to disrupt her paradise, Euphoria attempted to deescalate the conflict, and she eventually allowed Nyx to strip The Night That Is off her body.\nNyx's defeat\nReturned to her godhood, Nyx was able to pinpoint the location of the mysterious house, theHouse of Ideas. Realizing the house was the dwelling space of the fundamental creative force of reality, Nyx teleported herself to it to claim it as a seat of power from which she could remake the universe. The Avengers managed to follow her, but only Vision was able to get inside.[14]Inside the blank void within the house, Vision combined his knowledge from the Avengers files within his database with the house's nature to summon an army of constructs of Earth's mightiest heroes. This manifestation of the light of the human spirit pushed back against Nyx, weakening her until Vision, engulfed by this light's fire, burned the Queen of Nights to cinders. With her final words, Nyx swore that this fire wouldn't be able to burn her away forever. Following Nyx's defeat, the universal blackout caused by her return stopped.[6]\nOlympian Deity Physiology:Nyx possesses the conventional superhuman attributes of an Olympian Deity, including superhuman reflexes, speed, strength, durability and immortality."

Offutt,Roy Thomas,Mike DochertyFirstSavage Sword of Conan#53(April, 1980)\nIrises:\nDuring theHyborian Age, Isparana was a thief fromSquatter's Alley, inZamboula. It was also hypothesized (though it was stated in a defamatory rant) that she had been a prostitute on Zamboula's streets as well.[2]\nShe possibly had Stygian origins(see notes).\nShe became one ofConan'sFree Companions. When they reachedBisaraafter escaping theKothians, Ispara congratulated with Conan and approved his leadership. After they docked in theIslands of Pearland metAcheron, she was instantly charmed by his persona.[3]\nAsConanand the Free Companions set up camp onDagoth Hill,Acheronand Isparana continued to grow closer, and one night they consummated their love. However, that same night, Acheron was awakened from his sleep and drawn into the catacombs, where he found the empty armor of the Devourer. Isparana awakened and followed Acheron, while Conan heard their voices and investigated. Conan threatened Acheron to keep away from the armor, which caused Isparana to draw her sword to defend him. As Conan and Isparana struggled, Acheron fell the rest of the way under the sway of the call of the Devourer, and he donned the helmet. After putting on the entire suit of armor, Acheron was transformed both physically and mentally back into the Devourer.[4]\nWhen Conan escaped from the catacombs and confronted the Devourer, Isparana joined him, but their swords were no match for the Devourer. However, as Conan struggled vainly in hand-to-hand combat with the giant Devourer, smoke began to billow forth from the Devourer as it was consumed from within. The face of Acheron appeared once again within the helmet of the Devourer, and he told Isparana that his love for her kept his human aspect alive, and that he had managed to destroy the Devourer. The effort cost him, however, as his human body crumbled to dust, and the armor collapsed empty to the ground.[5]\nWhen they set up camp in an oasis not far fromShadizar, Conan let her sleep in his tent because of her nightmares, but she couldn't stop the assassins of the Night Cult from kidnapping the Cimmerian and bringing him back to Shadizar.[6]\nWhen Conan returned to the mercenary camp and his captainship was replaced byMilo, she didn't help the Cimmerian, afraid to endanger the child she bearing. She then decided to stay with the Free Companions and met Conan again in theTuranian steppes.[7]"

As they were dying, the druids offered themselves as a sacrifice to Morrigan (as well as to the Celtic godsTaranisandCernunnos) so that one day a warrior would be born to exact vengeance upon evil. In response, Morrigan, Taranis, and Cernunnos empowered the wooden staff carried by Moiragh (which came to be known as the \"Oak Staff of the Druids\") and became oathbound to one day empowera warrioras their instrument of justice on Earth.[16]\nCirca 150 B.C., after the death of her father, a girl-warrior inIrelandbargained for power from the supernatural and confronted Morrigan out of vengeance. The girl-warrior was successful in besting Morrigan, who lay bleeding out on the ground before the final blow. Before dying, Morrigan offered her power and position to the girl. The girl seemingly accepted, becoming the next incarnation of Morrigan for over two thousand years.[17]\n\nThe Morrigan in a former host body\nIn 1000 AD, theThird Hostof theCelestialsoccurred, during which the aliens informed they would return 1,000 years later to judge Earth's right to continue existing. While the pantheons prepared for war,Gaeaplanned a peaceful solution to the problem with many goddesses, among them Morrigan.\nFor the next thousand years, they searched for humans representing mankind's highest ideals, to be offered to the Celestials as an offering. The goddesses placed the candidates in suspended animation, with their superhuman potential, the legacy of theFirst Host, awakened.[18]\nMorrigan empoweringKyllian Boddicker\nIn modern times, Morrigan (along with her fellow Celtic godsTaranisandCernunnos) eventually chose American mob enforcerKyllian Boddickerto become their instrument of justice on Earth. To that end, the three gods each possessed Boddicker simultaneously, causing him to hear their voices in his head and to manifest mystical tattoos of different Celtic symbols on his body capable of casting a variety of magical spells. In particular, Morrigan persuaded Boddicker to pursue lasting vengeance against the criminals who killed his sister. As Morrigan and the gods' possession of Boddicker's body pushed him to the brink of insanity while he was avenging his sister's death,Dr. Strangesensed the massive expenditures of magical force and set out to confront Boddicker. Dr. Strange eventually cornered Boddicker on a rooftop and entrapped him in theCloak of Levitation, causing Morrigan and the other gods to briefly leave Boddicker’s body. Dr. Strange attempted to capture the three gods with a spell of entrapment to prevent them from repossessing Boddicker, but Morrigan sent a murder of crows to attack Dr. Strange and prevent him from maintaining the spell. Realizing that he must accept his fate, Boddicker agreed to serve as the gods’ instrument of justice on the conditions that they must assert no control over his free will and only come to his aid when summoned by him. The gods accepted Boddicker’s terms. Morrigan indicated that she did not care about Dr. Strange’s offer to tutor Boddicker on the use of his newfound powers, but only seemed interested in feasting on the evil souls that Boddicker would vanquish for her. The gods then bestowed the Oak Staff of the Druids upon Boddicker, who would later become the sorcerer known as Wildpride.[16]\nWhenTheresaneeded her power, the current host of the Morrigan was ready to die, and told Theresa the only way to claim her power is to kill her, which she did.[17]\nA newX-Factorwas created due to the influx of missing mutants and unknown deathsThe Fivecouldn't process for the resurrection protocols. Her host Theresa was one of the first mutants on their investigation list after she let out a sonic scream as she fell to her death on a Krakoan cliff.[19]\nResurrected by the Five, her host Theresa died again 5 days later inEnglandafter The Morrigan pushed her into suicide. Upon another resurrection, X-Factor interrogated her host about her mysterious deaths, but she avoided their questions and blatantly lied to them. When Theresa left theBoneyard, she was confronted by Lorna on why she wasn't being honest, which prompted the Morrigan to use Theresa to use her powers to bewitch Lorna into sabotaging the investigation on her. As she left, a murder of crows formed in the night sky, showing Morrigan was in full control of Theresa, and not a simple influence anymore.[20]\nGodlyAspect:\nMorrigan and her crows\n\nWith each new host The Morrigan takes ahold of, she gains her powers\nHaving Siryn as her current host, she hasmutantsonic acoustic powers similar to those ofSean Cassidy:\nAcoustikinesis: The ability to create various sonic effects through the combined action of her vocal cords and limited psionic powers which can only be used in conjunction with the sounds she produces."

The boy delivers his telegram toProfessor Elias Weems. Opening the envelope, Weems finds that the telegram is from his grandsonTommywho is coming to visit him on vacation. Excited that his grandson is coming to visit Weems hopes to show him the many things he is working at at his job at Modern Scientific Research Company. However, as fate would have it, a week later, Weems is let go because company policy does not allow anybody to work for them past age sixty-five.\nAngered by the fact of being fired only because of his age, Weems plans revenge against society for being so cruel and constructs a device that speeds up the aging process. Completing the device, he tests it out on a tree, a baby elephant, and a young woman before finding that it is perfect.\nCalling himself the \"Time Master\", Weems sends a letter to the police demanding control of the entire city or else he will prematurely age the entire population. Learning of this through his spy ants, Ant-Man manages to track down and confront Weems at his home. Weems uses his aging gun on Ant-Man and attempts to trap him in a flower pot. Weems then leaves to start aging the entire city, not suspecting that Ant-Man can free himself by growing back to his normal height.\nTracking Weems down, he finds the scientist on a rooftop aging the people in the crowd gathering below him. Ant-Man rushes to stop Weems, but Weems stops himself when he realizes that his grandson Tommy is in the crowd and has been prematurely aged as well. Attempting to reverse the process, Weems fumbles and drops the device off the side of the building, but it is caught by Ant-Man's army of ants. Ant-Man then instructs somebody in the crowd to use the device to change everybody back to normal, and Weems surrenders to the police.\nPleading to the judge, Ant-Man and the owner of Modern Scientific Research Company convince any charges to be waived, and Weems is given his job back.

While they were planning on killing the American troops in a small village called Ueno they were attacked by the village's protector Shigeru Ezaki in his guise as Tengu. During the struggle Shigeru's mask was knocked off and his face was seen by the Society's leader Umezu as well as Captain James Richards the man in charge of the American troops. After the fight Richards offered to keep Ezaki's identity secret as long as he promised to hunt down the rebel soldiers. Over the next few months Ezaki pursued them relentlessly until they were reduced to a small handful of men and then gave them the choice to either disband or be killed. Umezu told his men to pretend to disband while in reality working from within the system to gain power. Over the decades the former renegades formed themselves into a very powerful and successful Japanese business. The Society got into various fields such as cloning and hi-tech weaponry as well as creating branches abroad.\nOne day Umezu spotted Ezaki's picture in a newspaper and decided to strike killing James Richards and kidnapping Ezaki's family. Ezaki saved his family apparently at the cost of his life. In fact Ezaki was taken and used in cloning experiments until the Society had a virtual army of his clones. One of these clones was given special enhancements as well as training, but the Society believed they could no longer trust his creator and had him killed and the clone captured and put in suspended animation at their California facility.\nYears later the Society struck at the Ezaki's again prompting them and Captain Richards son Philip to resume the training Shigeru had begun with them and hunt down his killers as theShadowmasters. In the course of their struggle they crossed paths with thePunisherand theBlack Widowtaking the battle to the Society's main base where they discovered their father still alive. They managed to destroy the base and the army of Shigeru clones, but at the cost of Shigeru's life.\nThat setback forced the Society to reopen their California facility where the enhanced clone of Shigeru was accidentally revived after which he quickly fled. Despite sending both their special High Tech Ninjas and later their High Tech Soldiers they were unable to recapture the clone now calling himselfMace."

Logan realizes that the Hand set them up as part of whatever plans they have for Yukio and Amiko. Before they can executed, a man appearing to be a priest enters the cell block to offer prayers for the soon to dead prisoners. However, he is in realty a Hand warrior known as the Iron Monk. With is iron prayer beads he knocks out the soldiers and rips the door open to Logan's cell. He explains that he has come to slay the mutant and that nothing man-made can kill him.\nLogan is willing to give it a shot, however no matter what he tries to do, Logan cannot harm or kill this man. He manages to free Shirohana in the process, but even she cannot knock him out and is knocked out herself for her troubles. In the heat of the battle, Logan is surprised when a small man named Yohei -- a button man for the Yashida clan -- arrives to return the Honor Sword to Logan with an apology from the Silver Samurai for being unable to live up to his obligations to protect Yukio and Amiko. With the swords meteor forged metal, Wolverine is easily able to slay the Iron Monk. Logan grabs Pale Flower and the trio escape through the tunnel that Yohei came from. Along the way, Yohei explains who he is.\nWhile at the movie studio on Tokyo Bay that is in reality a front for the Hand, Akatora's minions Emi and Sumi continue their mental conditioning of little Amiko. When Amiko asks to see Yukio, the two women begin to convince her that Yukio never loved her, however the girl isn't so quick to believe them as Yukio has been taking care of her for some time[1]. Sumi goes down to the dungeon where Yukio has been kept and tortured since her capture for more conditioning of her own. Yukio warns Sumi of what will happen to them when Logan finally finds them and sees what they have been doing to his ward. Emi then reports back to Akatora about the progress she is having brianwashing Amiko, she arrives just as Akatora gets the news from the Noodle Vender that Logan and Pale Flower managed to escape prison and that the Iron Monk is now dead.\nWhile on the docks, Wolverine, Pale Flower and Yohei surface and Logan offers to help Yohei make it back to the Yashida clan when they are confronted by members of the Blue Monkey Gang. However, when Logan sets Shirohana down he is surprised to see that Yohei easily defeats their attackers. Pale Flower explains that Yohei is really the Yashida Clan's enforcer and that he feigns being harmless to trick his enemies. When she is surprised to know this, Yohei points out that she is a mutant with mind reading abilities. Meanwhile, Sumi and Emi are sent out to confront the Noodle Vender whom Akatora has learned was selling information to everyone including their enemies. The two women pull the Noodle Vender aside and prepare to eliminate him for his double crossing.\nBack on the docks, Wolverine explains that he is in a struggle against the Hand because they kidnapped Amiko and Yukio. When Yohei learns that Logan is seeking to rescue a young girl under his protection he offers to aid. Pale Flower, no longer desiring to kill Logan after he saved her life also wishes to come along and help him out.

In his apartment, Flash prepares for his first day of work as a teacher, noting that he needs to get out and do something normal for a change. Flash calls Katy Kiernan and gets her voicemail, but leaves a message asking if she's alright, noting she's the closest thing he has to a friend, since his mom doesn't have a phone, Valkyrie hates phones, andPetersuddenly stopped answering his calls. Sarcastically rehearsing an introduction, Flash uses the symbiote to snag his carrying case of symbiote suppressant and leaves his apartment. He flashes back to when he first bonded to the symbiote and notes that he probably should inject himself, but decides not to since he still feels in control.\nAt West Philadelphia High School, Coach Yates introduces Flash as the new assistant coach. A redheaded boy whispers an insult to a friend, and Coach Yates sternly states he expects everyone will show Flash the same respect they do him. As Coach Yates has the kids run laps around the gym, Flash thinks to himself that respect from a group of teenagers has to be earned and that he wasn't any different from the boy who'd insulted him earlier. Coach Yates asks Flash if he can handle himself, and leaves for his office when Flash says he can. Flash recognizes one of the boys as Rafe, who he'd saved the night before, and sees the teenaged girl he'd met the day before sitting on the bleachers with two other punks. Flash calls out to the girl, who introduces herself as Andi, and asks her why she and her friends don't feel like dressing out for PE. After mocking Flash's choice of words, Andi retorts that she doesn't feel like getting tired and sweaty first thing in the morning and then feeling gross for the rest of the day. The redheaded boy calls out to Flash, telling him the burnouts don't need someone to tell them how to sit in a chair all day and proclaims he's about to beat his record for laps. Wryly noting that that's what he was like in high school, Flash asks Andi for the boy's name. She introduces him as Darius \"The Franchise\" Fowler, West Philly's all-star, noting that he's stupid and wondering if every school has a guy like him.\nThat evening, Flash notes that his first day felt more like a week. Partolling the streets as Agent Venom, he recalls when he uncovered an experimental weapons cache and that some of the tech escaped into the world, making it his responsibility to track it down before people get hurt. Nearby, a hunchbacked old man carrying grocery bags makes his way to a townhouse before throwing off his coat, revealing himself to be emaciated with four large green jars protruding from his back, each containing a biomechanical organism. The man opens a can of dog food and ravenously eats it, but  pukes it up. He turns to a group of young people tied up nearby, moaning that he's starving, and asks for their forgiveness for what he's about to do. Tackling the man, Agent Venom notes he has no time for disguises or other tricks and tells the tied up people he's there to rescue them. The emaciated man says that Agent Venom isn't taking them anywhere, and as Agent Venom pulls a gun on him his flesh stretches and tears to reveal metallic tentacles. Screaming that they won't let him, the man lunges and pins Agent Venom to the ground, asking for his forgiveness. The man has a flashback to when the cybernetic creatures were implanted into him, and says that Venom shouldn't have come, brokenly expalining that the cybernetic parasites are ravenous and need to feed on flesh. Agent Venom retorts that he knows what it's like to live with a hungry partner, but that the man has to learn to keep them in check or they'll get more demanding. The symbiote coils a tendril around the cyborg's throat and flings him away, and Flash wonders if he's been off the drugs long enough for it to be waking up. Grabbing his gun and leaping to his feet, he sees that the man has fled, and notes he moves fast for a guy with malnutrition issues. Agent Venom frees the captives, and notes that while he's marking the night down as a win he still has to track the cyborg down before he claims a victim.\nElsewhere, the cyborg collapses from hunger outside an alley and notices a man sitting against a wall. The man, Eddie Brock, remarks that both he and the cyborg made mistakes: Eddie was tracking down a \"friend\" that the cyborg stinks of, and the cyborg was looking for a quick and easy snack. Transforming into Toxin, Eddie snarls that they both picked the wrong guy."

Similarly, Roxxon also approved Cybertek developing high-tech weapons and selling them to enemy powers, among other operations that attracted the attention of legal enforcement agencySHIELD. Roxxon had stolen the cyborg body ofDeathlok, who came froman alternate future, and delivered it to Brand'sHarlan Rykerto reproduce him. Ryker, by then assigned to Cybertek, created a new Deathlok with a voluntary human's brain, but that brain was killed due to a computer glitch. Ryker kidnapped naïve Cybertek programmerMichael Collinsand used his body on the Deathlok body, sending him to the country ofEstrellato obliterate a native guerrilla that was contrary to Roxxon's interests in Estrella; however, Collins' brain eventually took control over Deathlok's body and opposed Roxxon in Estrella. Ryker tried to coerce Deathlok to work for him by offering his previous human body and a way to go back there using the same Cybertek cybersurgeon team; however, Deathlok was aghast at Ryker's immorality and handed him to SHIELD. This publically exposed Cybertek's activities, and many Cybertek ex-employees went to jail. In an attempt to distance themselves from the scandal, Roxxon closed up the subsidiary division and distributed Cybertek's assets between Roxxon itself and other buyers likeAIMandMagnum Munitions. Roxxon also tried to recover lost Cybertek assets using wiles, especially when several ex-Cybertek employees settled inFrancein an attempt to continue their weapon-mongering activities, but they failed.\nWhenRoxxon Oil Corporationclosed down its subsidiaryBrand Corporationafter Brand's multiple illegal and immoral activities were made public,[11]initially Roxxon continued using Brand's assets for their nefarious ends,[12]untilCaptain Americaexposed their activities and shut it for good,[13]although not reaching the higher echelons of Roxxon.[14]One of the open projects in Brand at that point had started when Roxxon stole the cyborgDeathlok, who came froman alternate future; Roxxon delivered the cyborg to Brand Corporation's scientistHarlan Rykerfor him to disassemble and find a way to replicate it.[15][16][14]While working for Brand, Ryker succeeded in creating a robot duplicate of Deathlok,[15][14]which was destroyed,[17]and repaired and reprogrammed Deathlok as a servant of Roxxon,[15][18]but Deathlok overcame the control and returned to his time[19]in the same event that led to Captain America closing Brand for good.[13]\nRoxxon created a new company to cover the shortages that Brand's absence left: Cybertek Systems, Inc. Brand's assets, including equipment, knowledge and some of the staff, were transferred to Cybertek.[14]Like Brand, Cybertek was a company owned by Roxxon[7]operating as Roxxon's division for applied cybernetics.[2]Cybertek's main facilitywas inPaterson,New Jersey.[2]They also had an open space for tests,Cybertek Weapons Development Testing Facility 4, also in Paterson.[20]Roxxon stored some of Cybertek's products inRoxxon Branch Warehouse #23,Lynchburg,Virginia.[3]Also like Brand, Cybertek was involved in a number of criminal operations in theUnited States,[21]although many of its employees were unaware of this, believing they were simply involved in immoral activities such as developing state-of-the-art technology for military uses by other countries.[2]\nHarlan Ryker was reassigned to Cybertek[14]as the company's division head, in charge of all the other employees.[6]The following people are confirmed Cybertek employees:\nClayton Burr, as Vice President of International Development for Roxxon Oil Corporation, was not an employee of Cybertek, but Burr allocated Roxxon funds for Cybertek projects, and Ryker answered directly to Burr,[6]demanding constant successes of him.[2]\nThe Worker Ants were one of Cybertek's products.\nSome of Cybertek's products include:\nWorking for Cybertek, Ryker designed a new version of Deathlok, initially intended to be used by the United States Military,[8]and adding technology fromTimely Industries(which was secretly very advanced technology from the future provided byNathaniel Richardsfor his own ends).[27]along with other technically advanced data incorporated by Roxxon in the Phase 3 of the[14]\"Cybertek military cyborg designate: Deathlok\" project.[28]Innuendos about Ryker's Deathlok project reached fellow industrialist entrepreneurAnthony Stark; Stark knew quite some details about Deathlok (being able to recognize the final design at sight), but Stark did not know how much had Cybertek progressed.[23]\nAt that point, Roxxon and Cybertek were involved in a number of international activities,[10]the most urgent of which was in theSouth AmericancountryEstrella. Supported by the Estrellan government (which was illegally in Roxxon's payroll),[7]Roxxon intended to build a dam to obtain building terrain,[29][2]but in the process they would destroy several villages, and the locals organized a resistance movement that opposed the operation. More successful than they thought, the guerrilla were shooting up Roxxon's expenses.[29][7]The \"Estrella national dam project\" was protected by a 600-man military force, and included thirty-twoCybertek Worker Antsas construction devices, controlled from a Cybertek command center in the area, but still the guerrillas had to be dealt with.[7]To that end, Estrella intended to lease some Cybertek autonomous weapon that would take care of the guerrilla with extreme prejudice,[29][7]Several other investors also leased Cybertek weapons and unifnished products[14]all over the world for several years, which attracted the attention of international law enforcement agencySHIELD,[7]an attention that Burr knew of and wanted to minimize.[6]SHIELD however lacked evidence to go directly against Cybertek or Roxxon.[7]\nRyker disregarded weapon designerBen Jacobs'Cybertank[2]and instead focused on Deathlok for the Estrella operation,[2]using the investors' funds along with Roxxon's to improve the cyborg's offensive and defensive capacities and endurance.[14]Ryker recruited American military veteran ColonelJohn Kelly[8][9]for a \"Cyborg Super-Soldier Program\", so as to transplant Kelly's brain into a military cyborg body, explaining it was not a reversible process - but Kelly was unhappy with his life and agreed.[9]Cybertek made a test run in the Testing Facility #4, witnessed by Burr[20]and other parties interested in the lease,[9]during which Kelly argued the orders and in response the cyborg's onboard computer electrocuted Kelly's brain, killing him.[9][8]Ryker insisted on ending the test, which was considered a success[20]- but Cybertek needed both a new brain donor[20][2]and to correct the error so that the computer would not fry the following brain.[2]The new brain, however, was to be lobotomized[30]and used only for storage purposes.[2]\nSeveral Cybertek employees working in the Deathlok project\nHarassed by Burr to reach the deadlines in the Deathlok project, Ryker's team corrected the software problem, discarded Kelly's brain and found another donor, Cybertek's director of computer programming sectionMichael Collins, who was threatening to expose Cybertek's secret projects which he had discovered by hacking the company's system, but instead was knocked down by Ryker.[2]Pretending that Collins had suffered an accident, Ryker spoke withCollins' wife[6]and promoted Collins' subordinateJim Dwormanto Collins' former position.[6]Deathlok's cybersurgeon[5]Dr. S. Hu, worried about organ rejection, insisted to keep Collins' body as a potential organ bank.[10]\nCollins' brain was inserted in Deathlok without his authorization,[2]but Cybertek failed to lobotomize him properly.[30]Deathlok and the project's team were sent to Estrella, where Deathlok massacred a resistance encampment,[2]but Collins had been a pacifist[8]and his brain gained control over the cyborg before he could kill young girlEmilia Verdugo. Collins obtained full control over the cyborg body[2][29]once he and the Cybertek staffers were back in Paterson; even though Cybertek tried to stop him, Deathlok escaped, destroying the Cybertank in the process - but, unwilling to return to his family home in Paterson in his new state,[2]Deathlok became a superpowered vigilante active inConey Islandwhile also trying to find more information, and hopefully a cure, for his situation. Deathlok used the phone to hack information on Cybertek, finding a mention to \"Project: Estrella\", then contacted his friend Dworman for help, hoping Dworman could obtain that file. However, Ryker had foreseen this, and had Dworman bugged and followed. Once Ryker discovered that Deathlok was hiding near Coney Island Amusement Park, he sent Cybertek private contractorIan Wajler, alias Mainframe,[6]also a superhuman technopath,[24]to lead an attack using Cybertek weaponry (Dragonflies,Terminal Armors, and theSQ1 Deep Sea Attack Craft) to apprehend Deathlok. Mainframe not only failed, but he also wrecked the park in daylight, attracting attention, and being arrested himself - however, Cybertek's contacts ensured that SHIELD would not be in charge of the investigation.[6]Still, Ryker was unaware that SHIELD had been tailing him for some time, in an attempt to link him with illegal weapon sales in Estrella, but they could not prove the crime.[7]SHIELD also failed to link Ryker with his other criminal activities, negotiating to sell a shipment of Cybertek weapons toJapaneseentrepreneurShiro Yoshida[7]for three billion dollars, transferred to aSwissbank.[10]However, SHIELD agentN'Gamidid steal from Cybertek a tape with the Deathlok test run.[7]\nDiscovering about Roxxon's illegal activities in Estrella in the file, and understanding that he had been used to murder the guerrillas there, Deathlok used a refitted Dragonfly[7]to fly to Estrella and join resistance forces led by localJoseph Verdugoagainst Roxxon and theEstrellan Armed Forces.[29][7]Ryker placed Jacobs in charge of the defense of the dam, insisting that the dam's protection was his first concern; but Jacobs instead prioritized several attempts to kill Deathlok, as Jacobs was angry that Deathlok had defeated his Cybertank and humiliated him. Jacobs' behavior contributed to[7]the victory of Deathlok and the guerrillas, defeating the soldiers, deactivating the Worker Ants[29][7]and destroying the dam (with Roxxon's explosives), which caused such expenses that Roxxon had to abandon the project[7]in shame[29]while the Estrellan government collapsed.[29][7]Enraged, Burr wanted Ryker's head on a plate.[7]\nTrying to escape, Ryker sold Yoshida his weapons,[10]unaware that Yoshida was being manipulated by fellow Japanese nationalistYoritomo, who intended to exploit Yoshida's naïve honor to illegally rearm Japan and start an attack. Before Ryker could leave Paterson for Japan, both Deathlok and SHIELD, the later using aStane Industries Mark XIVLand Attack Vehicle, surrounded Cybertek's facilities. SHIELD directorNick Fury, correctly assuming that Ryker would be protected by high-tech weapons, allowed Deathlok to raid the facility first; indeed, Ryker usedHunter Dronesand a warhead-bearing missile against Deathlok, but then convinced Deathlok to join him by offering a return to Collins' original body.[7]Ryker and Deathlok stealthily left forKobe, slipping past SHIELD, although Deathlok contacted SHIELD from there. During the day of the negotiation, Yoritomo betrayed both Ryker and Yoshida, pretending that either of those two was trying to murder the other; but SHIELD joined the fray and Deathlok convinced Yoshida that he had been tricked. SHIELD seized Cybertek's assets and arrested both Yoritomo and Ryker. Ryker asked Deathlok to vouch for him in exchange for being returned to Collins' body but, as Ryker intended to continue his illegal arm trafficking deals, Deathlok instead gave Fury data he could use against Ryker in a criminal process.[10]\nWith Cybertek's crimes made public,[21]Roxxon attempted to steer clear from them[3]and dissolved Cybertek, disposing of its assets (including equipment, technology and contracts) by selling those to several corporations, includingMagnum Munitions.[31]However, more than half of Cybertek's research ended up in the hands of criminal organizationAIM[22]and Roxxon still claimed ownership over several specific technologies, including Deathlok's.[9]Roxxon promoted programmer Jim Dworman so that he'd oversee the closure of the facilities, ensuring that all the employees were given notice and that the resources were disposed.[3]At that point, Deathlok was skimming every possible information source in search of his body and of Dr. Hu, the Cybertek cybersurgeon who performed the procedure and who could, theoretically, reverse it,[10]and Dworman allowed Deathlok to access Cybertek's records, unauthorized, during this time.[3]\nSeveral Cybertek ex-employees and associates were sent to jail, some like Mainframe imprisoned inRyker's Island(not related to Harlan Ryker),[22]and others imprisoned inDanburyMaximum Security Federal Penitentiary, a number of them agreeing to testify against Ryker. TheNSA, in charge of the investigation, had already copied some evidences from Cybertek's computer. Ryker, from jail, managed to activate Cybertek's hunter-seeker assassinWarwolfso that it'd track and kill the witnesses, and destroy the evidences. Warwolf succeeded in killing former Cybertek employeeWilliam Hansen, also a former friend of Ryker who had managed to be released on bail; and then Warwolf destroyed both the records and the copies; then going after former Cybertek accountantJohn Rozum, imprisoned in Danbury. Deathlok however found of Ryker's plan and stopped Warwolf; Warwolf's backup memory, accessed by Dworman, provided additional proofs against Ryker.[3]\nDeathlok kept an eye on any Cybertek file related to him so that, should anyone open it, he would be notified via thecyberspace. Such happened whenStark ProstheticsR&D directorCurtis Carrstole a file from Magnum Munitions, alerting both Deathlok and Magnum. Deathlok tracked Carr toDenverand confronted him; having only partial information, Carr believed that Deathlok was John Kelly, sent to kill Carr, and that Cybertek was still active in secret. This also led to a confrontation with Magnum Munitions' forces, that demanded the return of any Cybertek asset.[31]\nThe Cyberwarrior, surrounded by several ex-Cybertek employees (Left to right: Ben Jacobs, Stanley Cross, and Harlan Ryker)\nSeveral ex-Cybertek employees, including Mainframe[22]and Ryker, managed to escape from jail; others likeStanley Cross, Ben Jacobs, Dr. Hu andDr. Kimblemay have never be apprehended. These six in particular associated with other cybernetic specialists inParis,France, to build cyborg super-soldiers calledCyberwarriors, that were to be sold internationally,[9][32]including toIraqso that they could attackKuwait.[33][5]The ex-Cybertek employees were wanted people in the U.S. and would be sent to jail if they returned, but most of them had no reason to go back; Cross claimed that the government had closed Cybertek because the later \"wouldn't play ball\", and that they were entitled to profit overseas. Roxxon's Clayton Burr, by then promoted to President of International Development,[9]was secretly associated with Ryker to get a part of the profits,[26]but betrayed Ryker by sending after him both Deathlok and another cyborg assassin,Coldblood-7,[9]saying to the later that both Deathlok and Ryker were criminals,[26]and to the former, that he'd be returned to his human body but Roxxon would keep the cyborg one \"for research purposes\". Simultaneously, SHIELD moved to stop the Cyberwarrior operation, claiming that Roxxon was trying to recover Cybertek's assets for illegal ends and through illegal means.[9]While Collins' body was lost, SHIELD, Deathlok and their other allies stopped the former Cybertek employees, and both Ryker and Burr were arrested.[34]\nWith Cybertek totally closed, Deathlok still kept an eye on any rumor related to Cybertek or his human identity, eventually hearing thatStark Enterprisesowned Cybertek weapons partially designed by Collins - which was true, as Stark had absorbed Stane International, which had made deals with Ryker, but Stark was unaware of this. Deathlok infiltrated Stark's mainframe, confirmed that there were 37 results when looking for Cybertek and Collins, then had to enter physically Stark's facilities to delete those. Deathlok was confronted by Iron Man (secretly Anthony Stark himself), who at first thought Deathlok was Harlan Ryker's industrial spy, while Deathlok believed that Stark Enterprises was openly corrupt. Once they settled their differences, Iron Man allowed Deathlok to delete any Cybertek weaponizable product from Stark Enterprises' files.[23]"

Ernst, however, was aware of his brother’s envy.[6]\nIn 1959, he was recruited into theAvengersalongsideUlysses BloodstonebyNick Furywhile inBoston.[7]The newly formed team then traveled to Helsingborg, Sweden, in pursuit of theRed Skulland his Fourth Reich. The group hijacked a Nazi truck bound for the Skull's castle headquarters, with the Silver Sable acting as the driver. He was forced to open the back doors to the truck as the guards were suspicious of him, at which point the rest of the team jumped out and opened fire on the unprepared Nazis.[8]When the team stormed the castle, they found a NaziCaptain America impostorwho attacked them.

The heroes soon overpowered and killed the impostor whileNamorasucceeded in capturing the Red Skull.[9]Nick Fury then took the contents of the Red Skull's briefcase and left, telling the rest of the team that he would meet up with him later. He then disappeared for over a month.[10]When he resurfaced, he gathered the Avengers together at theStork Clubin New York City to congratulate them on a job well done.

Morty suggested Ernst adopt Fritz’s personality traits, but Ernst dismissed the idea.[2]"

This greatly complicates what is going on in his life. For five years, Ben thought he was a clone of Peter Parker. It was later revealed that he was the original Peter Parker all along and that his clone had taken over his life. The discovery of a third body throws all past claims into question.[Continuity 1]He thinks about how the real clone, took over his life as Peter Parker, married his old girlfriendMary Jane, and are expecting their first child.[Continuity 2]The only friend he had during this period of time wasSeward Trainer, who is no help to him now as he has been in a coma since his mind was trapped in cyberspace.[Continuity 3]Putting the bones away and changing into Spider-Man, Ben also recounts the return of Kaine and his recent battle with theRhino. He doesn't know why the two were fighting but intends to put them behind bars.\nMeanwhile,James Johnsmeyerhas a conference call with other backers of theGreat Game. The other backers are concerned about the involvement of Spider-Man and Kaine in the current wager. They want to know if they should cancel the current wager or factor the new elements into the bet. James tells them not to be hasty and insists that they incorporate the two outsiders into their current game and begins asking for wagers. While at a warehouse on theLower East Side, Kaine andShannon Fitzpatrick-- the woman known as Muse -- have been laying low after Kaine's battle with the Rhino. She insists that Kaine use this opportunity to rest and heal, pointing out that Johnsmeyer is a man of many resources and won't like Kaine's lack of interest in participating in the game. When Kaine questions Shannon's trustworthiness, she reminds him that she put her own career into jeopardy in helping him out.[Continuity 4]Their discussion is interrupted when the Rhino comes bursting through the wall intent on eliminating Kaine. While at theDaily Bugle,J. Jonah Jamesonis with his senior staff. After seeing Spider-Man stealing the mysterious corpse in a Spider-Man costume, he has jumped to the conclusion that the original Spider-Man was murdered by this new comer. WhileKen Ellisis eager to roll with this narrative,Urichisn't sure they should jump to a conclusion, pointing out that Spider-Man has changed his costume in the past.[Continuity 5]Joe Robertsoncautions Jonah about going with this angle until Urich and Ellis learn the facts. Jameson points out that the Daily Bugle reports facts, not the truth and that truth is in the eye of the beholder. Elsewhere in the city, Spider-Man continues his search for Kaine and the Rhino and comes up with nothing. He decides to change his strategy by hitching a ride on a nearby news helicopter figuring they'll take him to the villains faster when they show themselves.\nBack on the Lower East Side, Kaine continues to battle with the Rhino, a battle that becomes more complicated whenJoystickandPolestarjoins the fray. Kaine quickly finds himself overwhelmed and begins losing the battle. That's when Muse tries to join the fight and use her powers to incapacitate the other members of the Great Game. Sadly, this fails when Joystike manages to ambush her. This distracts Kaine, allowing the Rhino to finally land a blow. That's when Spider-Man arrives on the scene to lend a hand, despite Kaine's insistence that he doesn't need help. While Spider-Man deals with Joystick and Polestar, Kaine tries to get to Muse only to be impeded by the Rhino. While at a hospital, a nurse checks on Seward Trainer who is still in a coma. He is visited by his daughterCarolyn. Unaware that Carolyn is also the new Doctor Octopus she decides to give Trainer some privacy with his daughter. Carolyn thanks the nurse, ominously telling her that she doesn't how much time her father has left. While back at the scene of the battle, the Rhino's confidence begins to waver when Kaine uses his rarely used wall-crawling ability to rip a large section of a building and uses it to club the Rhino into submission. Shannon has recovered by this point and tells him that he doesn't need to kill the Rhino as he has already won by scoring first blood in this game. Kaine is disgusted that they treat violence so frivolously, telling her that it is all he has known his entire life. Meanwhile, Spider-Man manages to stop Joystick by crushing the wrist bands that power her weapons. She congratulates the wall-crawler for finding this weakness as she flees, vowing he won't be lucky next time they meet. Before Spider-Man can go after her, he is ambushed by Polestar. However, Polestar is too busy complaining over how unfair the battle has become that Spider-Man is able to knock him out as well. However, once the members of the Great Game is down, he is angry that they prevented him from catching Kaine.\nLater, while Kaine is off looking for refuge, Shannon contacts James Johnsmeyer. Kaine's suspicions prove to be valid as she is working with Johnsmeyer to ensure large profits before Kaine is destroyed. While back on the Lower East Side, Spider-Man waits until the authorities arrive to collect Rhino and Polestar. With the two villains in police custody, Spider-Man resumes his search for Kaine. He is certain that he'll track his old enemy down, as he managed to tag Muse with a spider-tracer during the battle.\n... The Return of Kaine continues inSpider-Man#66."

Ryker betrayed Collins and had his brain placed into the Deathlok cyborg body. When Michael awoke, he found himself in the cyborg body, but unable to control it. The Deathlok cyborg was then tested, and Michael watched in horror, unable to do anything, as his cyborg body killed a couple of soldiers. Eventually, Michael gained control of the Deathlok cyborg and set out to find Harlan Ryker and make him pay for what he had done to Michael. Michael caught up with Ryker as he was making illegal weapons sales to a private army.

Roxxon stole the cyborg[9][11]and delivered it to Ryker[9]for him to study,[11]disassemble and replicate it[9][10](Ironically, on Earth-7484,an alternate version of Harlan Rykerhad created Deathlok in the first place).[7]Ryker created a robot duplicate of Deathlok,[10][11][7]that Deathlok delivered to another of its divisions,Nth Command;[7]the robot was sent to infiltrateProject P.E.G.A.S.U.S., but was then defeated and destroyed.[11][7]This robot however served as a prototype for Ryker's further version of Deathlok. Ryker's team was known to have spent more time studying Deathlok's design than really trying to replicate it.[10]\nRoxxon was forced to close up Brand Corporation when Brand's irregularities were exposed, but secretly continued using Brand for illegal operations.[13]Meanwhile, Ryker managed to reactivate and reprogram the original Deathlok, reprogramming it as a faithful servant of Roxxon.[7][11]Roxxon delivered Deathlok to the Nth Command, that was involved in a doomsday operation that would replicate the apocalyptic Earth-7484 future; but the meddling ofCaptain Americaand some travellers from Earth-7484 spoiled the project;[11][9][13]Deathlok, his original mind restored, returned to his original timeline. Brand's crimes were again exposed and many of its members were apprehended,[14]but Ryker's involvement was apparently not known.\nMeanwhile, Ryker was involved in the education of his daughter, trying to transmit his stern values - such as how allies are useful, but friends are a hindrance, how she should devote all her time to learning, not to loitering, and how a single decision made under duress can define a person's whole life. Rebecca grew up as a shy girl,[1]but also as a scholarly thinker, with a focus on mathematics, and a dedicated sportswoman, with a focus on swimming.[8]Since 8 years of age to 14, Rebecca was sent to swim five days a week, even if she repeatedly expressed how she failed to be interested in it, simply because her father wanted her to build character through competition - She became one of the best swimmers in the state, even if she wanted nothing about it.[1]Only many years later she would know that her father paid her extracurricular training by building ghastly weapons.[8]\nRoxxon then created a new Roxxon-owned company,[15]Cybertek Systems, Inc., the applied cybernetics division, based inPaterson,New Jersey,[3]to replace Brand, and transferred to it Brand's equipment, knowledge and some of the staff,[10]including Ryker, who became the Division Head of Cybertek.[16]Ryker was assigned a secretary,Laurie.[3]Like Brand before it, Cybertek was secretly involved in illegal development of weaponizable technology with Roxxon's complicity, including the hunter-seeker assassination cyborg with lupine organicsWarwolf, stored in a Roxxon warehouse inVirginia.[17]Other of Cybertek's designs had hidden capacities, like theWorker Ants, unmanned robot drones designed by Ryker's team and presented as construction devices, with non-obvious military capacities.[15]Many of Cybertek employees were aware only of the existence of a weapons development area in the company,[18]but they mistakenly believed that the work done for other areas was not used for weapons: Instead, Ryker absorbed that work, without the developers knowledge.[3]For instance, Cybertek software development headMichael Collins[19]believed he was writing software for prosthetic limbs to be used by disabled people, but Ryker reused this for military cyborgs.[3]Collins' work on bionics was also used in patents, some of them for weapon systems, that Ryker licensed without Collins' knowledge and sold toStane International,[20]always presenting a friendly face to Collins.[17]Ryker also met Collins' wifeTracyin person, and knew that Collins' best friend was their coworkerJim Dworman.[16]\nCybertek weaponry appearing all over the world attracted the attention of international law enforcement agencySHIELD, whose directorNicholas Furycorrectly deduced that Ryker[15]and his superior, Roxxon's Vice President of International DevelopmentClayton Burr,[16]were involved in illegal gunrunning activities - and this was true, Roxxon, like other multinational corporations, had several governments on their payroll and sold them Cybertek weapons. For years, SHIELD tried to obtain evidence to take both to justice; but Roxxon had very high-ranking contacts that prevented Fury from getting what he needed.[15]\nHarlan Ryker (bottom left) leading the Deathlok project in Cybertek\nRyker's pet project for Cybertek was the continuation of Deathlok, brought for Brand. Ryker redesigned the future Deathlok to create a better weapon systems, usingencephalonic technologyas its core component, nanotech to repair minor damage to organic systems,Adamantiumfor the skeleton and an adamantium-steel alloy for muscles and cartilage, a fusion generator to power it,[21]and a very advanced onboard computer complementing the organic brain.[22]Ryker formed a team for the project[22]including genius expert technician and scientistStanley Cross, who had security skills;[17]genius scientist researcherBilly Hansen,[19]who became Ryker's best personal friend and right-hand man;[17]weapons designerBen Jacobs;[3]cybersurgeonsDr. HuandDr. Kimble;[5]and any Cybertek contractor[16]or employee who needed to know about the project, and could handle that information, was informed about as much as needed.[3]Ryker took the data obtained from Brand and added technology fromTimely Industries(which was secretly very advanced technology from the future provided byNathaniel Richardsfor his own ends).[23]along with other technically advanced data incorporated by Roxxon in the Phase 3 of the[10]\"Cybertek military cyborg designate: Deathlok\" project.[24]Besides spending Roxxon's financing, Ryker managed to found investors willing to lease his still-unfinished weapon, which, in combination with Collins' software, allowed him to increase the endurance, reflexive action and offense/defense capacities of the cyborg.[10]Still, Roxxon had stringent deadlines for Ryker to finish his weapon, as they already had battlefields to use it.[3]\nAs the design was officially for the United States Military,[11]Ryker approached military officers to transplant a voluntary's brain to the cyborg.[3]On Earth-616, like on Earth-7484, Ryker approached ColonelLuther Manning, but in this universe, Manning was uninterested in Ryker's cyborg supersoldier program, indeed failing to grasp all the details, and rejected him. Manning came to serve under Harlan Ryker's brother, General Simon Ryker.[2]\nRyker had better luck with a later candidate, ColonelJohn Kelly, aVietnam Warveteran[note 1]who later worked forNYPD, in both cases believing that he was not allowed to win, and whose wife and daughter had abandoned him. Ryker tempted Kelly with the idea of \"the first in a series of military cyborgs designed for victory\", Kelly volunteered,[4]and his brain was transplanted to Deathlok. Ryker then staged a test run attended by Burr and by several parties interested in leasing Deathlok,[4][22]to take place in Cybertek Weapons Testing Facility 4, also in Paterson. Ryker hired twelve armed mercenaries to confront Kelly, the later armed only with paint pellets, the former with real weapons.[22]Mid-exercise, when Kelly tried to fight his own style, the computer considered this a faulty behavior,[4]and electrocuted Kelly's brain, lobotomizing him dead.[22][4][11]In the bunker, Dr. Hu noticed the problem and Cross suggested aborting the test, but Ryker refused. Deathlok, controlled by the computer, raided the bunker and aimed at Ryker, but did not shoot as the test conditions had been met and there was no reason to attack anyone there.[22]\nBurr complained to Ryker that delays in the Deathlok project would not be accepted and, if the board of directors was unhappy, Ryker would be in trouble. Ryker reassured Burr, then went to Cybertek facilities to manage the situation. Ryker demanded that they find and correct the software glitch that had allowed the computer to kill the brain and take over the cyborg, in less than 24 hours, as Ryker wanted a new brain transplant the following day - even if they didn't have a brain donor yet. Hu decided that Kelly's brain was useless and discarded it, no autopsy needed, yet they agreed that Hansen could take it for his personal research. Hansen ordered the programming team to review all of the software, which prompted its director Michael Collins to investigate the reasons. Hacking Cybertek's computers, Collins discovered that his work was being used for military purposes he disagreed with.[16]Believing that this must have been a secret to Ryker too, Collins went to whistleblow this issue to Ryker. Ryker was meeting with Jacobs, who wanted to recommend the Cybertank as an alternative weapon (but Ryker disagreed because the Cybertank offered him only firepower and he needed more versatility), and then Collins confronted Ryker. Ryker humored Collins, took him to a secluded office, then knocked him down[16][25][26]with a dart gun and phoned Laurie to prepare the brain transplant, with Collins as an unwilling donor.[3]Dr. Hu was against it, as Collins had proven to be particularly moral, which could affect the results.[16]After Hansen corrected the software glitch, the brain was to be used only for storage[3]and Ryker ordered cross to lobotomize Collins, which Cross failed to do properly.[27]Hu was also worried that Deathlok's organic components may reject Collins' brain, so she suggested to keep Collins' body \"in ice\" as a potential organ bank; Ryker agreed to do so, and took good care of the body even after they proved that there was no rejection.[28]Ryker also made up a story about Collins having had an accident and promoted Dworman as head of the programming section.[16]\nRoxxon had interests inEstrella, aSouth Americancountry whose government had been bribed by multinational corporations controlling the local economy.[15]With few solid land on which to build, Roxxon was erecting a dam[3]using Ryker's Worker Ants as construction devices, but this was affecting negatively the local's life (not to mention damaging the environment), which led to them organizing a resistance movement with armed guerrillas. More successful than they could have expected, the guerrillas were causing the cost of the project to skyrocket,[15]which prompted theEstrellan Armed Forcesto lease Deathlok to complement their own soldiers. Ryker accompanied Deathlok and the team to Estrella and once there, from a bunker, the team oversaw as Deathlok was sent against a resistance campament, which he destroyed while killing almost all the people there - Collins' mind imposed itself over the computer when it tried to kill young girlEmilia Verdugo. Hansen detected and reported the glitch, but Burr convinced the Estrellan military that the operation had been successful. Still, Ryker and his team knew that there was a problem, and that it could be replicated, so they returned to Paterson with the intent of solving it immediately.[3]\nRyker arranged a meeting to find the reason, but then Collins took control over the Deathlok body and, using its capacities, released himself and tried to escape the facility. Security was unable to stop him, then Jacobs asked Ryker to let him try using the Cybertank. Deathlok defeated Jacobs, broke the Cybertank and the floor of Cybertek, and humiliated Jacobs by leaving him helpless among the wreckage of his pride and joy. Deathlok escaped but, unable to return home (as Collins' wife saw him as a monster),[3]he became a vigilante inConey Island.[16][11]Collins understood that Ryker had turned him into an assassin,[17]but programmed countermeasures so that Deathlok would not kill.[16]\nSimultaneous to this, SHIELD agentAl Mackenzie, deducing that Cybertek was behind the Estrella skirmish, tried to link Ryker to the sales of arms made to Estrella. SHIELD director Fury ordered agentPierceto monitor Ryker, but Pierce and his team failed to obtain evidence. AgentN'Gamihowever stole from Cybertek a tape from the test where Kelly had been killed.[15]At this point, neither SHIELD not Roxxon knew that Ryker had hidden another prospective deal withJapaneseentrepreneurShiro Yoshida, who offered to buy a shipment of ready-to-use Cybertek weaponry for three billion dollars; Ryker stalled his final decision on this matter.[15]Still, SHIELD raised the pressure on Burr, claiming that they knew about his lost weapon; and Burr in turn passed the buck to Ryker, threatening to use an alternative weapon on Estrella and getting rid of Ryker in the process. Ryker met again with his team, and Hansen correctly deduced that Collins was the new vigilante in Coney Island. Ryker then ordered Cross to monitor Dworman while Ryker himself talked to Mrs. Collins, foreseeing that Collins may contact either his friend or his wife - and once they'd track Collins, he'd unleash a superpowered agent on him.[16]\nRyker lied to Tracy claiming that her husband was in medical care, no visits allowed, but offered her her husband's full salary \"while he recovers\"; he also warned her against a robot \"pretending\" to be Collins. Meanwhile, Collins indeed contacted Dworman, asking him to steal records from Cybertek; Dworman did, unaware that Cross was following his steps, and thus Ryker discovered that Collins was hiding near the Coney Island amusement park. Ryker sentMainframe,[16]a superhuman cybernetic technopath[29]and Cybertek private contractor, with several Cybertek weapons including theSQ 1 Deep Sea Attack Craft,Dragonfly air vehicles, and agents inTerminal Armors. Mainframe escalated the situation to an open battle in a park full of people, and when Ryker called him to order minimal public impact, Mainframe only tried to destroy the press helicopter. However, in the end, Deathlok escaped andthe policearrested Mainframe. Using Roxxon contacts, Ryker had theNational Security Councilto be in charge of the investigation, which prevented SHIELD from finding anything on him. Even after talking in person with Fury at Coney Island, Ryker was not worried about SHIELD - and intended to prepare a plan to deal with Deathlok, correctly deducing that the later would return to Estrella.[16]\nIndeed, a few weeks after Collins had became Deathlok,[28]he returned to Estrella (in an \"appropriated\" Dragonfly) to ally himself with the guerrillas and organize an attack against the dam: If the dam could be destroyed, then the cost would be so high that Roxxon would abandon the project altogether. The dam was protected by 637 Estrellan soldiers and 32 Worker Ants, which had military capacities. Ryker remained in Paterson, but sent Jacobs to Estrella to control the Ants and the Cybertek technology. When Deathlok revealed his presence with the armed guerrillas, Ryker ordered Jacobs to prioritize the protection of the dam, and only try to destroy Deathlok if it was possible; however, Jacob had developed a thirst for revenge against Deathlok, and disregarded his orders. This was one of the reasons of the battle result, in which the guerrillas blew up the dam and the Worker Ants using explosives, the army surrendered to the rebels, and Deathlok captured Jacobs and forced him to reveal where he could find Ryker, not to mention a political situation in Estrella that derailed Roxxon's plans. Burr phoned Ryker (through Laurie) to notify the later that his troubles had just started.[15]\nBeing nothing if not ready, Ryker had a fallback plan ready: He immediately phoned Yoshida and accepted his deal,[15]planning to exile himself to Japan.[28]However, at that point Ryker was still physically in the Paterson building, and two forces had laid siege to it: Deathlok, and SHIELD, the later using aStane Industries Mark XIV Land Attack Vehicle. SHIELD's Nick Fury tried to ally with Deathlok against Ryker, offering to use Deathlok and his data as evidence to arrest Ryker; and, he agreed to let Deathlok raid the center first, correctly assuming that Ryker would have had high-tech defenses. Indeed, Ryker sentHunter Drones, a warhead-bearing missile and other defense systems against Deathlok - but once Deathlok reached Ryker's office, Ryke revealed he had Collins' body and could return Deathlok's brain there[15](as long as he had Dr. Hu's help). In exchange for that, Ryker recruited Deathlok's help for the Yoshida operation. Ryker guided Deathlok through a escape route that allowed them to slip past Fury with the shipment of weapons.[28]\nRyker and Deathlok met Yoshida in person inKobe. Yoshida, protected byninjabodyguards, assumed that Deathlok was Ryker's security. Yoshida promised to deposit the payment in aSwissbank the following day, and Ryker would then arrange the weapon delivery; once in a hotel in central Kobe, Deathlok criticized Ryker's immorality (and as soon as he was alone, Deathlok contacted SHIELD). However, Yoshida was allied with Japanese nationalistYoritomo, who wanted to rearm Japan and take it to war (while Yoshida only wanted toprotecthis country), and abused Yoshida's naïveté: Yoritomo cancelled the bank transfer, staged an attack against Ryker using ninjas so that Ryker would believe that Yoshida had betrayed him or die in the process (Ryker survived as Deathlok protected him); and used English-speaking agents in Cybertek's Terminal Armor to stage a heat-based attack on Yoshida to make the later believe that Ryker had betrayed him; as Yoshida was the superhuman mutant Sunfire, the attack was doomed to fail. Yoritomo also told Yoshida that Ryker's weapons were defective and useless. Ryker decided to leave Kobe by boat with Deathlok; but Yoshida, in Sunfire garb, attacked their transport and kidnapped Ryker, leaving Deathlok behind. Brought to Yoritomo and hand tied, Ryker was accused, and Yoritomo convinced Yoshida that Ryker was lying. Deathlok and SHIELD both tracked Ryker and attacked Yoshida's facility, while Yoritomo also told Yoshida that Ryker had brought SHIELD. However, during the conflict, Yoshida fought Deathlok, and the later convinced the former that Yoritomo had been tricking him. In a final attempt to achieve victory, Yoritomo tried to use a Cybertek nuclear missile launcher to attackWashington, D.C., but was stopped. SHIELD arrested both Ryker and Yoritomo; but Ryker tried to convince Deathlok to vouch for him in exchange for returning Deathlok to Collins' body. However, when Ryker revealed that he intended to continue his gunrunning activities, Deathlok instead offered Fury any data he had to use as evidence against Ryker.[28]However, Deathlok's testimony was rendered null in the United States because the court doubted whether Deathlok was a sentient person or just hardware; the case against Ryker needed to be based on other evidence and witnesses.[17]\nRoxxon tried to distance itself from Cybertek's crimes to reduce its own responsibility, and instead arranged to close down Cybertek. Many employees also involved in the illegal activities were arrested and sent toDanburyMaximum Security Federal Penitentiary, a number of them, including account managerJohn Rozum, agreeing to cooperate with theNSAin the investigation and provide evidence against Ryker or be witnesses in the case. Billy Hansen made a deal to obtain a suspended sentence and be released on bail.[17]Dr. Hu and others escaped capture.[28]However, Roxxon intended to not move a finger to help Ryker.[17]\nRyker's arrest was processed in an NSA center inVirginia. Instead of calling a lawyer, Ryker used his call to activate Cybertek assassin cyborg Warwolf, also stored in Virginia, so that it would destroy the stored evidences against him, and any copy of those in Cybertek's facilities, and also murder the prosecution witnesses. Warwolf murdered Hansen, then destroyed the evidences in both NSA and Cybertek facilities, but in the process revealed itself to Deathlok. Correctly deducing what was happening, Deathlok warned the NSA, with Dworman as his middleman, that the witnesses were in danger; but the NSA believed that the prison offered enough protection. Deathlok then sneaked into the prison to threaten Ryker, but Ryker was sure that holier-than-thou Deathlok would not kill or even hurt him. Deathlok left Ryker when Warwolf reached that same prison and tried to kill Rozum. Deathlok stopped Warwolf and damaged it beyond repair; and then Dworman accessed Warwolf's backup memory and obtained proof that Ryker had ordered Warwolf murder Hansen.[17]\nThou Ryker was in prison, not all the details about him were publically accessible.Curtis Carr, director of research and development forStark Prosthetics, stole Cybertek files already owned by a different company, and was then tracked by Deathlok. Carr wrongly believed that Cybertek was still active and had sent John Kelly, the previous Deathlok, to kill him. Deathlok took a moment to explain Carr the real events.[25]Similarly, innuendos about Ryker's Deathlok project reached fellow industrialist entrepreneurAnthony Stark; Stark knew quite some details about Deathlok (being able to recognize the final design at sight), but Stark did not know how much had Cybertek progressed.[20]\nAt some point, Ryker hired the secretTailor Group, created to hunt dangerous superhumans, to go after Deathlok and destroy it. Ryker offered twenty million dollars and provided Tailor with the Deathlok schematics, explaining that Deathlok was merely a robot. Tailor Group leader and agentTracereventually went after Deathlok but, during the fight, a cyberscan revealed that Deathlok was a sentient individual, a person with a life and family, meaning that Ryker had lied to Tailor. Tracer cancelled the operation altogether.[30]\nRight to left: Ryker, a Cyberwarrior, Cross, and Jacobs\nRyker got released on bail, then associated[31][32]with several other former Cybertek employees (Cross, Hu, Jacobs, Kimble and Mainframe) who settled inFrancefor an ilegal project related to theCyberwarriors,[4][33]a mass-produced cyborg super-soldier[34]designed by Ryker himself,[11]with strategic programming written by Jacobs[6]and with lobotomized human brains used as \"wetwarestorage\" so they could run up to 37 software programs simultaneously.[35]Associating with other cybernetics specialists, including Fox and Borruso,[4]they aimed to build and sell Cyberwarriors[4][33]to the highest bidder[35]and even before finishing the tests, they had already made pre-sales all over the world,[4]including to terrorist organizationULTIMATUM[35], to the terroristHydra-splinter branchGenesis Coalition(shipment already delivered at this point),[35]and to theIraqimilitary.[36][5]\nAfter Ryker's situation in Kobe, these people risked going to jail should they ever returned to the United States.[4]The team had a main underground base under the city ofParis[4]and a secondary base in the outskirts, the later calledCyberbase.[5]Ryker had not only evaded prison, he had also brought Michael Collins' body to France with him, even though some of his partners recommended him not to.[35]At this point, however, he had not joined his teammates in person in their base.[4]To obtain brains for Cyberwarriors, Ryker ordered the team to bribe medical institutions so that they supplied them with brains of recently-deceased patients to be used in the Cyberwarriors but, as this was ineffective, Ryker then made coma-induced patients to be falsely diagnosed as in terminal state, so that their brains could be accessed - even though Kimble complained at the immorality of the operation.[5]\nRyker was secretly in cahoots with Clayton Burr,[35]by then promoted to Roxxon's President of International Development.[4]Burr was to manipulate the events so that Deathlok visit the Cyberwarriors base, apparently to allow Ryker's men to capture Deathlok and take over the Deathlok technology.[35]Indeed, Burr recruited Deathlok to stop the secret Cyberwarrior operation in France, claiming that the Cyberwarrior technology belonged to Roxxon. To bait Deathlok, Burr both appealed to the later's morals (Deathlok opposed to those weaponizable cyborgs being sold around the world), and also told him that Michael Collins' body was being kept in France by Dr. Hu, and that Deathlok's brain could be restored.[4]Burr had also warned Ryker that Deathlok would go the base, so they'd be on alert.[35]However, Burr also hired cyborg mercenaryColdblood-7to murder both DeathlokandRyker, betraying his ally for profit.[4][5][37]Coldblood being moral for a mercenary, he agreed to track Deathlok and Ryker for their \"bounties\"[37]only after seeing false evidence that linked both to murders in Estrella, Japan and the United States - although only Ryker was guilty of those crimes;[5][37]Coldblood intended to track Deathlok before going after Ryker.[35]Simultaneous to all this, international law enforcement agencySHIELDwanted to obtain the Cyberwarrior technology to be used by them[6]while also going after Roxxon's illegal deals, and SHIELD's directorNick Furytried to mislead Deathlok so that he would not go to Paris[4]by openly lying to him.[4]\nDeathlok did go to Paris and called his former allySilver Sable, leader of the mercenary groupWild Pack, for reinforcements. They discovered that a Parisian branch of ULTIMATUM had bought Cyberwarriors, and raided the ULTIMATUM base so that the terrorists would reveal the Cyberwarrior secret base location.[35]Meanwhile, Ryker arrived to the Paris base, to check the results of the final phases of his own plan,[4]witnessing, along with Cross and Jacobs, the Cyberwarriors being tested under controlled conditions. Ryker and Jacobs noticed the advantages of working without Roxxon's oppressive bureaucracy, and when Cross mentioned that the only problem in the Deathlok project had been Collins, Ryker reprimanded Cross, reminding him that Cross's responsibilities had included lobotomizing Collins' brain. Jacobs was angry at Mainframe because the later had prevented him from killing Deathlok in the past; but Jacobs required a prosthetic super-strong armor to move, and Mainframe used his own powers to control Jacobs' armor, controlling Jacobs' movements with Ryker's approval, and forcing Jacobs to work as a forklift for warehouse duty against his own wishes - Both Ryker and Mainframe agreed that Jacobs was erratic and prone to not follow orders, making remote servo-restraints a necessity; thou Ryker was happy to see Jacobs no longer requiring a wheelchair[6]like when they worked for Cybertek,[3]he understood that Jacobs could not be trusted to move completely unrestricted.[35]Jacobs was however in charge of controlling the Cyberwarriors during combat operations.[6]\nWhile Ryker was in a meeting with some of his colleagues (including Cross and Hu) to detail the current situation and sales,[35]Deathlok and the Wild Pack raided the underground base through the warehouse where Jacobs and Mainframe were. Jacobs immediately wrestled Deathlok, being his match in a one-on-one, while Mainframe called in a squad of Cyberwarriors for reinforcements and directed them against the Wild Pack.[35][38]During the fight, the Wild Pack proved superior to the Cyberwarriors,[35]and Deathlok tried to connect to a Cyberwarrior's software so as to override Mainframe's control over it - but at that point, the consciousness of the previous Deathlok, John Kelly, was active in Deathlok's hardware as an artificially-intelligent software and, wanting more independence and mobility, Kelly inserted himself in the Cyberwarrior and controlled it. Taking the alias \"Siege\", Kelly used his new Cyberwarrior body against the other Cyberwarriors, contributing to turn the tide so that the Cyberwarriors were systematically being beaten and destroyed. Mainframe (wrongly believing that Siege was a glitched Cyberwarrior) contacted Ryker to report that, as expected, Deathlok had attacked but, not as expected, Deathlok and his allies were wrecking the stock of Cyberwarriors they intended to sell. Worried to the point of sweating, Ryker ordered Mainframe to retreat and abandon the base for the Cyberbase, so as to protect as many Cyberwarriors as possible, then revealed to his partners that he had Collins' body at hand as an asset. Ending the meeting, Ryker video-called Burr to inform him, but Burr just ordered Ryker to take care of the situation, or Burr would send SHIELD after Ryker. Ryker submitted to Burr's will, not knowing that Burr intended to betray Ryker even if Ryker prevailed.[35]\nMainframe tried to flood the base so that their enemies wouldn't get useful information from it; but Silver Sable discovered the secondary base before that. After a battle against the Cyberwarriors in the city, she told Deathlok where it was, but she herself and the Wild Pack left to fight their own enemies, the Genesis Coalition, who had received a shipment of Cyberwarriors. Deathlok and Siege then tried to blow up the remainder of the main Cyberwarrior base, but SHIELD stopped them, so as to do a forensic analysis on the facility.[35]The parties struggled, and Siege was accidentally buried alive - but he emerged unscathed soon afterward. En route to the Cyberbase, Deathlok was ambushed by Coldblood-7, but the former managed to convince the later that they were both on the same side and that Roxxon had deceived Coldblood - so Coldblood allied with Deathlok,[5]both going after Ryker (Coldblood to get the bounty on Ryker's head).[5]\nRyker's team and the remaining Cyberwarriors regrouped in the Cyberbase, where Jacobs told them that, for what he heard during the fight, the rogue Cyberwarrior was being controlled by Kelly's consciousness - making Mainframe and Ryker consider the commercial possibilities of compressing a human consciousness in a chip that could be inserted in a body. Dr. Kimble also complained openly about the unethical measurements they were taking,[5]and Ryker transported a shipment of Cyberwarriors toBaghdad,Iraq,[5]in a first attempt to sell those to the Iraqi military,[36](specifically a ColonelSinje, whom Ryker had previously met)[6]which wanted to militarily recoverKuwait. This transaction was detected by SHIELD, and, expecting problems there, they took theirHelicarrierto Iraq.[5]\nThe Cyberbase was first attacked by Siege, who wanted to kill Ryker and damaged Jacobs' armor. Soon afterward, Coldblood and Deathlok joined independently - Coldblood wanting Ryker for the bounty, so that Deathlok was the only enemy who wanted to capture Ryker alive. Mainframe activated the Cyberwarriors as a defense. Ryker, wanting to recover control over the situation, murdered Hu and took Kimble hostage, saying that only Hu and Kimble could restore Deathlok's brain to his original body, which was kept in the Cyberbase; and, Ryker also activated a bomb in Deathlok's body that would trigger a nuclear warhead in the facility, with Ryker being the only person who could stop the detonation - thus, he thought, Deathlok would be forced to save Ryker's life.[5]However, Kimble escaped Ryker's grasp, and Coldblood put his weapon on Ryker's head. Ryker then asked Jacobs for help, and both Jacobs and Ryker were teleported[6]to Iraq,[37]their other allies abandoned in Paris. The former Cybertek scientists worked with Deathlok and Coldblood to successfully stop the nuclear detonation and, once they did that, Siege tracked the Cyberwarrior signal using his own Cyberwarrior body; the three cyborgs agreed to go after them, and Deathlok even hacked SHIELD's communications to pinpoint the Cyberwarriors, as the Helicarrier had detected them in detail.[6][37]\nIn a secret installation in Iraq, Ryker and Jacobs met with Sinje in the secret basement of a military installation, where they coordinated to stage a 10-Cyberwarrior attack aiming to destroy the oil fields of northern Kuwait, with Jacobs controlling the attackers from a nearby bunker. The fields were surprisingly defended by airborne Siege and by Deathlok and Coldblood, both riding Deathlok's flying vehicleDragonfly. Sinje was surprised seeing his Cyberwarriors destroyed. Ryker made the overpowered Cyberwarriors retreat to attack a nearby American Military Outpost, where they were to destroy all the equipment and soldiers; but then even the Helicarrier joined the fray with artillery attacks. Deathlok's scanning found the source of the Cyberwarriors command and informed his allies. Deathlok literally surfed on a damaged, flying Cyberwarrior to attack the bunker, using the Cyberwarrior as a ram to break its wall (and knock Jacobs in the while), then battered Ryker; Nick Fury stopped Deathlok from killing Ryker, promising that Ryker and other traitors would be legally punished - and indeed Fury used Ryker to arrest Burr too: Fury took Ryker to Burr's office in theRoxxon Oil Corporate Headquartersand, with Fury listening in the shadows, Ryker spoke to Burr so that Burr would speak incriminating evidence; then Fury arrested Burr while Ryker reminded Burr that Ryker had threatened to bring others like Burr down should Ryker fall.[6]The Cyberwarrior sale to Iraq was stopped,[36]and Siege left to track yet other Cyberwarrior shipment[6]while Deathlok, Coldblood and SHIELD returned to the United States.[6]Other Cyberwarriors sold to the Genesis Coalition were destroyed by the Wild Pack and other people like theKnights of Wundagore.[39]\nDuring theInfinity Crusade, Deathlok was forced to relive important events and reconsider whether his actions had been moral. Deathlok, who refused to kill, was forced to confront his own respect for life because he had had a chance to kill Ryker and instead protected Ryker's life, which led to Ryker murdering Billy Hansen and releasing an army of Cyberwarriors.[40]\nAfterward, Deathlok still kept an eye on any rumor related to Ryker, Cybertek[41][20]or his human identity so as to find a way to recover his body, eventually hearing thatStark Enterprisesowned Cybertek weapons partially designed by Collins - which was true, as Stark had absorbed Stane International, which had made deals with Ryker, but Stark was unaware of this. Deathlok infiltrated Stark's mainframe, confirmed that there were 37 results when looking for Cybertek and Collins, then had to enter physically Stark's facilities to delete those. Deathlok was confronted by Iron Man (secretly Anthony Stark himself), who at first thought Deathlok was Harlan Ryker's industrial spy, while Deathlok believed that Stark Enterprises was openly corrupt. Once they settled their differences, Iron Man allowed Deathlok to delete any Cybertek weaponizable product from Stark Enterprises' files.[20]\nRyker's wife and son, a moment before being killed by a future Deathlok\nRyker, recognized as a one of the foremosts specialists in cybernetics, was released from prison to work as a weapons scientist for U.S. government agencies, thou he was forbidden from performing unauthorized or illegal experiments and kept under a watch. He thus returned to his family life and obtain prestige among professionals and amateurs (likeKaty Bashir) as a genius in his field; him having being behind the Deathlok project was also made public. Through these years, Ryker was intermittently attacked by time-travelling rebels from alternate futures who wanted to kill him before he could invent the Deathlok technology, and every now and then a Deathlok from the future reached the present time and tried to kill him in vain. Ryker cared little for this threat, as he considered himself properly protected against it, and he also noticed that his enemies were unable to use time travel properly, missing the moment where they should have attacked. Ryker failed to foresee, however, that one of these attacks would target his family home at a moment he was not in: ADeathlokexploded, fatally wounding Ryker's wife and son, and severely wounding his daughter.[note 2]\nHarlan Ryker, expert in cybernetics\nHarlan Ryker is a doctor of medicine and expert surgeon,[7]and also one of the main experts in cybernetics in the whole world. His most advanced work, either hardware or software, is so advanced that other specialist in the field are flabbergasted when trying to understand it, and his prowess is recognized both in his field and in the mainstream community. He managed not only to successfully create Deathlok cyborgs from corpses, but to use the technology to save and maintain the life of his daughter, something that would be many times more difficult when dealing with a living subject.[1]\nRyker also proved to be quite acrobatic, as he was able to escape Coldblood-7 by flipping while his enemy opened up point-blank fire on him.[5]\nRebecca Ryker (right) with a LMD pretending to be her father (left), but not Harlan Ryker"

His mother, a survivor of the atomic bombing inHiroshima, died on the night of his birth. Raised under the influence of his uncle,Tomo, Shiro was indoctrinated into hating the Western world. When visiting the ruins of Hiroshima with his uncle, Shiro had hismutantpowers activated, turning him into a raging furnace of atomic fire. Trained by his uncle in the use of his abilities, he was given a costume that evoked Japan's imperial colors. AsSunfire, Shiro, alongside his uncle, planned to get revenge against his enemies, the Americans. However, Shiro's father,Saburo, as one of Japan's greatest ambassadors, advocated for pacific relations with the West, which led him to disapprove his son's vindictive tendencies. Regardless, Sunfire attacked theUnited Nations Plazaduring a diplomatic ceremony held by his father, where he was stopped by theX-MenBeast,Angel, andIceman, who had detected his mutant signature. After escaping, he attempted to destroy theCapitol Building, but was fended off this time by the X-MenCyclopsandMarvel Girl. During the conflict, Saburo was murdered by Tomo. In a burst caused by his immediate grief, Sunfire murdered his own uncle in retaliation. As his last words, Saburo asked Shiro to live for the future and to fight for peace.[1]\nA divided Sunfire returned orphaned to the land of the rising sun. InTokyo, he met theDragon-Lord, who sought to restore Japan's status as a world power by threatening the world and found in Sunfire an agent for his goals. On the island ofKrakinowa, Sunfire was caught in a conflict withNamor the Sub-Marinerwhen one of the Dragon-Lord's prisoners made contact with Namor's ally,Betty Prentiss. Later, as Sunfire was sent to capture an American cargo ship, Namor intervened. However, Sunfire ultimately burned the ship down. As destruction ensued, Sunfire realized the ramifications of his actions and was convinced by Namor to team up with him to rescue the shipwrecked and defeat the Dragon-Lord. After the Dragon-Lord was defeated, Sunfire attempted to have a revenge against Namor, though he failed miserably.[5]They would clash again whenCaptain Americaand Namor battled inOsakaover a piece of theEvil Eyeduring theconflict between the Avengers and the Defenders. Sunfire interrupted them and took the Eye for himself feeling neither of them had the right to fight over it in his homeland. He held it for a moment before Namor knocked him out of the sky, causing it to fall into Captain America's hands.[6]\nIn order to regain his honor in Japan, Sunfire took it upon himself to advance Japan's reconstruction work inVietnam. There, a Vietnamese Major proposed an agreement for him to eliminateIron Manto gain top priority from his government, which was just a deception to off the golden avenger for his benefit. Sunfire gladly agreed, considering taking out the bodyguard of Tony Stark, whosecorporationrivaled those of Japan's. When Sunfire ambushed Iron Man andRoxie Gilbert, the two heroes fought until Sunfire was suddenly teleported to theMandarin's underwater base. Mandarin, trapped in theUnicorn's dying body, baited the trapped Sunfire into powering his Mind-Exchange Machine to return him and Unicorn to their proper bodies.[7]As Iron Man attacked the Mandarin's base, Sunfire realized the potential for his escape. However, the ensuing destruction of Iron Man and Mandarin's fight resulted in the base flooding, and Sunfire nearly drowned, only to be freed with Iron Man's assistance.[8]Later, Sunfire endeavored to defeatUltimo, whom Mandarin summoned to take backhis castlefrom theYellow Claw. He had very little success, though, due to using up most of his solar power earlier in his escape. Sunfire tried to use his remaining solar power to fly away, but he wasn't fast enough and ended up in its grasp. Fortunately, Iron Man managed to free him once again, and they worked together again to trick the alien robot into burying itself under a mountain. As Sunfire parted ways with Iron Man, seeing him as an ally and reconsidering his views of America.[9]\nWhen most of the original X-Men were trapped byKrakoa, Sunfire was one of the mutants recruited byProfessor Charles Xavierto rescue his original students. Though he had no interest in joining other mutants, Sunfire agreed by feeling honor bound and wishing to reintroduce himself as a warrior to the world. During the mission, Sunfire formed an assault team withNightcrawler. The rescue was a success[10]but, right after the mission, Sunfire left the team, alleging his loyalty lied with his country only and departing on bad terms with the X-Men.[11]\nWorking to protect Japan's sacred honor in his views, Sunfire attackedStark Industries, claiming Tony Stark's interventionist approach in Japan was disgraceful since he allegedly bribed Japanese officials to perform his transactions. Stark went to protect his facilities, wearing theGuardsman Armor, which prevented Sunfire to recognize him as Iron Man. The fight was interrupted byMichael O'Brien, who wore the Iron Man suit. However, the Mandarin, seeking revenge for his last defeat, captured O'Brien with a teleportation device, believing him to be the real Iron Man.[12]When Stark returned to the fight, this time as Iron Man, he believed Sunfire had blasted O'Brien out of existence and a battle ensued. With the intervention ofJasper SitwellandFujiko Watanabe, Sunfire was knocked out.[13]\nSunfire and the X-Men met again when the latter, after becoming adrift following an incident in theSavage Land, were rescued by theJinguichi Maruship's crew and docked at Agarashima. The city was devastated by a fire, a result of an earthquake. As the X-Men attempted to help, they were confronted by Sunfire, who led a team of combat troops and ordered their arrest. Sunfire was stopped by theDaughters of the Dragon, the detectivesMisty KnightandColleen Wing. The groups settled at the Yoshida Manor, where they were surprised by another earthquake and attacked by mercenaries wearingMandroid Armors. After Sunfire and the X-Men defeated the villains, the architect behind the attacks was revealed to beMoses Magnum, who schemed to threaten the Japanese government into crowning him Emperor of Japan.[14]Sanctioned by the Prime Minister of Japan, Sunfire accompanied the X-Men in infiltrating Magnum's complex in theKuril Islands. WithBanshee's effort, Magnum's base was destroyed and his plans foiled. Sunfire then signalled the Daughters of the Dragon to rescue the X-Men and welcome them back to his home during Christmas.[15]As the X-Men left, Sunfire for the first time declared he regarded the fellow mutants as friends.[16]\nSunfire rose as Japan's greatest super-hero warrior, always operating for the Japanese government's best interests. When several heroes of Earth were abducted by theGrandmasterandDeathto be part of theContest of Champions, Sunfire was part of the large group of players. Grandmaster battled Death over the right of restoring his brother, theCollectorto life. Sunfire was recruited to be part of Death's first team of champions, who were tasked of assembling theGolden Globe of Life.[17]On theNorth Pole, alongsideInvisible GirlandIron Fist, Sunfire was supposed to compete againstDaredevil,Darkstar, andTalisman. However, he chose to act without his teammates' consent and search for the prize by himself and attacked Darkstar, causing a conflict between the two groups. When Daredevil claimed a piece of the globe, Sunfire's squad found their defeat.[18]At the end of the contest, the heroes returned home.[19]\nWhen the X-Men returned to Earth coming from an adventure in theBattleworld, they emerged in theKanagawa Prefecturewithgiant dragonwho had disrupted their teleport. As the dragon headed toTokyoseeking to destroy it, the Japanese defenses forces, assisted by the lord of Yashida Clan, Sunfire's cousinMariko, sent Sunfire to help with the crisis. Sunfire joined forces with his allies, the X-Men, in combating the dragon, who was eventually convinced byLockheedto leave.[20]\nAs Japan's prime hero, Sunfire tried to keep his community free from menaces, like super-villains such as theCorruptor, who believed Japan provided opportunities for his activities as a bank robber. As Shiro Yoshida, however, he maintained a humble disguise, by enrolling at theUniversity of Tokyoas a student. When attending the inauguration of a new science building he had built for Tokyo university, Yoshida had the opportunity to encounter the funder of the building,Dr. Kishi Oramosha, as he discoursed to the crowd. Oramosha, much to Yoshida's disappointment, revealed himself to be an ultranationalist terrorist named Deadline and shared his plans of destroying major cities, using a solar-based device to force an international union against corporate exploitation of Earth. His first chosen target was Tokyo, a city with no super heroes. Enraged by this revelation, Yoshida came out as Sunfire and fought Deadline, hopelessly trying to destroy his machine. Being supported by his colleague, Erin, a French exchange student, Sunfire redirected the machine's energy using his powers, rendering it useless. With Deadline arrested, Tokyo was saved.[21]\nSunfire was eventually enlisted byYoritomo, a Japanese nationalist who had been Shiro's idol since he was a child. With Yoritomo by his side, Shiro Yoshida rose as a powerful businessman, making deals withRoxxonto acquireCybertekweaponry. After a transaction was made withHarlan Ryker, Yoshida and Yoritomo discussed their plans of creating an army of super-agents to restore Japan's grandeur. However, a disagreement ensued between the two partners, as Yoshida wished to restore Japan's honor with a defensive task force and Yoritomo sought for revenge and power. Enraged, Yoritomo secretly attempted to murder Yoshida usingTerminal Armors, who had no chance against the power of Sunfire. Though Ryker was framed by Yoritomo, Sunfire learned the truth after being restrained by Ryker's unwilling bodyguard,Deathlok. WithS.H.I.E.L.D.'s assistance, the heroes joined forces to stop Yoritomo's plans of nukingWashington, D.C.[22]\nWhen an experimental drug, known asSleet, was introduced to the water supply of a small village in Japan, its inhabitants tragically perished in an act of chemical warfare. The Japanese government commissioned Sunfire to investigate, and the clues brought him toMadripoor. There, he contacted one of his father's respected friends,Cable, whose investigation, similarly to Sunfire's, led him to reach theMutant Liberation Front. Teaming up with Cable'sNew Mutants, Sunfire confronted some MLF's members and invaded their hideout. Sunfire and the New Mutants were captured byStryfe, who confirmed the MLF was behind the production of Sleet, part of a plan to poison the major capital cities of the world.[23]As Sunfire and the New Mutants broke free, the MLF was fended off with the help ofWolverine, allowing Sunfire to incinerate the Sleet supply.[24]\nWhenMagnetodisrupted Earth's magnetic field by unleashing a massive electromagnetic pulse, Sunfire was unprotected when caught by the onslaught wave.[25]The experience caused him to uncontrollably release his atomic blazes upon Tokyo. Though no one was harmed by this incident, the Japanese government, fearing a potential nuclear disaster, reacted with extreme caution by imprisoning Sunfire. He was freed by his cousin, the new leader of the Clan Yashida,Silver Samurai, with the assistance of Wolverine. Concurrently,Bastionsaw an opportunity to carry out hisOperation: Zero Toleranceagainst mutants all over the globe, including Japan, convincing the Japanese government to reactivate the mechanoidRed Roninas an anti-mutant asset. The Silver Samurai, a mutant himself, asked for Wolverine's and Sunfire's help in shutting the Red Ronin's installation down. After the Red Ronin was activated, Sunfire lost control of his powers one more time in order to escape from being crushed by the already deactivated robot. Wolverine managed to calm him down and suggested him to get support inCanada, withDepartment H, since Sunfire's reputation was damaged by the Japanese media.[26]\nNow a man without a country, Sunfire arrived at Department H, where he was immediately identified and apprehended as an intruder.[27]As a prisoner, Sunfire was experimented on as part of the \"Helios Project\" run byDr. Horatio Huxley, who claimed Sunfire was afflicted by radiation poisoning.[28]Unexpectedly, Sunfire was rescued byAlpha Flightrookie membersRadius,Murmur, andFlex, who left Department H.[29]However, the band of runaways became victims ofMesmero's mental manipulation powers in a restaurant. Though Sunfire initially resisted Mesmero's control, he was ultimately forced to act as a cook for his restaurant. Although Murmur managed to break them all free from Mesmero, the other, more experienced, members of Alpha Flight were targeted instead.[30]As a battle ensued, Sunfire and Alpha Flight overpowered Mesmero, who managed to escape.[31]\nAs Sunfire worked with Alpha Flight, his condition worsened, evidenced by a dark spot developing on his abdomen.[2]Still subjected to Huxley's experiments, Sunfire's entire right half of his body was covered by the black splotch.[32]Since he found no help in Department H and Alpha Flight, Sunfire decided to return to Japan, even if it meant for him to be imprisoned.[33]Before leaving, he helped Alpha Flight to counter an invasion performed by theZodiac.[34]\nSunfire made a private return to Japan, settling in an abandoned ancient temple in the Quonon province, where he intended to await for his end in peace. However, his was located byHiro Takachiho, a young genius who idolized Sunfire as a hero and tracked his bio-atomic signature. Their reunion was interrupted by the Silver Samurai and his new super-hero group, theBig Hero Six, who wished to recruit both Sunfire and Hiro for the team. Sunfire refused, alleging his heroic days were over,[35]but accepted help from Big Hero Six to assess his condition. However, Hiro's mother was kidnapped by the villainEverwraith, in an blackmailing attempt to have Sunfire. When Hiro approached Sunfire a second time, he found only a shadow of a hero and lost his hope for help.[36]Hiro and the Big Hero Six attempted to stop Everwraith, in order to rescue his mother and protect Tokyo. Sunfire decided to join the group as a hero and learned Everwraith wished to forge a stronger Japan by causing destruction. When Everwraith tampered with Sunfire's powers, Hiro suggested him to release it as a way to control it, assuming a bio-kinetic charge had been introduced to his organism, causing conflicts with his solar-based powers. The action caused Everwraith's defeat, apparently at the cost of Sunfire's life. However, Hiro once again met him, as he was sure his hero had survived. As Sunfire departed back to Canada to investigate his condition, Hiro shared Sunfire had not only a fan but also a friend.[37]\nRecovered from his infection with the Zero Fluid, Sunfire returned to serve Japan, this time by working withYakiba, a clandestine elite defense faction of the Japanese military. When investigations identified a shapeshifter involved in murderous secret activities in Japanese facilities, Yakiba sent Sunfire to trackMystique. As Sunfire and Yakiba agents invaded Mystique's apartment inBrooklyn, they clashed with her daughter, the X-ManRogue, instead.[38]With Sunfire believing Rogue to be Mystique, they engaged in a fight. After proving her identity, Rogue convinced Sunfire that Mystique had actually been framed.[39]\nThe X-Men revealed to Sunfire thatSkrullsunderApocalypse's orders were behind the misguiding leads and that he was named as one of the mythical \"Twelve\" mutants. After Sunfire got access to this information, he alerted his associates in Yakiba. However, before they could take any action, Sunfire was abducted by theHorseman of ApocalypseFamine.[40]As one of the \"Twelve\", Sunfire represented the power of nature along withStormandIcemanand was trapped by Apocalypse, who wished to channel their powers for himself.[41]Apocalypse was ultimately stopped by the X-Men, an action that allowed Sunfire to get his freedom again.[42]\nAfter being exposed to \"Zero Fluid,\" Sunfire began having problems with his power. TheWeapon Plus Projectfalsely told him his powers and the fluid had formed cancer throughout his body and that he would have had to serve them for the necessary treatments. After refusing, Sunfire was shot byWild Childand was thought dead, though he managed to survive.[43]With a new outlook on life after his near death experience, Sunfire looked at things differently, re-joining the X-Men after they went global.[44]\nIt was publicly leaked that Sunfire and his uncle had dealings with mutant terrorists from the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,Mystique,Rogue, andBlindspot, back in the day. They plotted to steal the plans for theAdamantiumbonding process created byLord Dark Wind. Tomo Yoshida wished to create an army of \"invincible samurai\" with this process, while the Brotherhood would have received a substantial amount of money in return. However, the plot failed forcing Blindspot to remove the memories of all involved, including Dark Wind's daughter,Lady Deathstrike. While Deathstrike's cybernetic implants enabled her to restore her missing memories and plan for revenge, Silver Samurai was reverted to being a criminal by Blindspot. Rogue contacted Sunfire about the crisis and the two sought to learn the truth.[45]During a subsequent battle with an enraged Deathstrike, Sunfire's powers triggered a sprinkler system, filling the environment with steam. Lady Deathstrike furtively moved behind him and severed his legs from his body.[46]While prisoners to Deathstrike, Sunfire told Rogue to absorb his mutant powers so she could fight her. She agreed, but only with a momentary touch so as not to strain his condition. Blindspot pushed Rogue onto Sunfire however, forcing a permanent absorption. Sunfire was presumed to be dead, and the X-Men were unable to find his body.[47]\nIn actuality, Sunfire was taken to a private infirmary and kept under watchful guard by members of Clan Yoshida and theHand, who tried to convince him to accept prosthetic limbs. However, being suicidal, Sunfire only wished for a sword so that he could end his misery. He then received a visit from the newly resurrected Apocalypse who gave him an enticing offer to join him in saving mutantkind, in return for which Apocalypse would restore his powers and his lost limbs, allowing him to get revenge against those who had maimed him. Sunfire accepted.[48]Soon before starting the process of being transformed into a Horseman, Sunfire regretted his alliance with Apocalypse and attempted to escape his pyramid ship after defeatingOzymandias. As he struggled with his choice of escaping, he decided not to leave the mutantGazerbehind to suffer by also being turned into a Horseman. As Sunfire failed since Gazer's transformation intoWarhad been a success, he was also transformed into one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse.[49]\nAs Apocalypse's loyal HorsemanFamine, Sunfire assisted in an attack against the X-Mansion, using his solar flares to give their eyes and brain imagery that forced them to feel like they were starving.[50]Famine was ultimately knocked out by Rogue and taken into the X-Men's custody.[51]As Gazer attempted to recapture him for Apocalypse, Sunfire proved to have overcome his brainwashing and refused to rejoin the Horsemen.[52]Slightly recovered, Sunfire then fled the X-Mansion and joined the X-Men in their final battle against Apocalypse at theUnited Nations.[53]After Apocalypse managed to escape, Sunfire decided to help the Horseman ofDeathGambitrecover his reason by cleansing him with scorching hot flames, that led him to abandon his loyalty to their former master. The duo joined forces to recruit the Horseman ofPestilencePolaris, but were met with her rejection. Back to Japan, Sunfire and Gambit were approached byMister Sinister.[54]\nUnder Sinister's guidance, Sunfire and Gambit got a new purpose withMarauders, a group of mercenaries assembled by Sinister to findDestiny'sDiariesand eliminate people who had had contact with information about the future. Sunfire and Gambit attacked the time-travellerCablein the dead island nation ofProvidence, apparently being successful in eliminating him.[55][56]Sunfire then interceptedIcemanandCannonball, who had been attacked by the other Marauders but managed to escape.[57]Sunfire failed and was incapacitated and restrained by the two X-Men,[58]but soon rescued by the Marauders.[59]\nThe Marauders' actions aimed at keeping the X-Men ignorant about the birth of the hefirst mutant babyborn afterM-Day. When the child was born inCooperstown,Alaska, the Marauders violently clashed with the mutant-hatingPurifiers, a massacre the X-Men were unable to prevent.[60]The X-Men followed the Marauders to their base but were overpowered for being attacked by multiple enemies.[61]Their attack also led the Marauders to realize that Cable had survived the murder attempt and was protecting the mutant baby by himself.[62]The Marauders managed to find the baby with Cable andBishopinEagle Plaza, the latter was put out of commission by Sunfire.[63]During the final battle to get the baby onMuir Island, Sunfire was knocked out while most of the other Marauders died or escaped.[64]\nLost and facing an identity crisis, Yoshida gave up his Sunfire identity and wandered in a drunk haze aroundTokyo, whereWolverineoffered him a position withAvengers Unity Squad. He initially refused for regarding himself as disgraced and no longer a superhero. Wolverine informed him about theRed Skullviolating Charles Xavier's telepathic brain, which prompted Sunfire to accept the offer. When revealing their roster to the public, the team was attacked by theGrim Reaper, who was accidentally killed by Rogue.[65]\nSunfire joined the Avengers just before Apocalypse'sClan Akkabahad its leadership taken by theApocalypse Twins. As their first action, the twins assassinated aCelestial Gardener, catching the attention ofS.W.O.R.D.'s directorAbigail Brand, who invitedCaptain Americaand Sunfire to thePeakfor help. Clan Akkaba's Ship attacked the Peak forcing its occupants to escape. When Captain America's escape pod did not function, Sunfire sacrificed his own to save Captain America.[66]As the escape pods drifted away, the Twins' ship blasted the Peak in half. Sunfire fell to Earth, atomizing the debris and saving millions of civilians inRio de Janeiro. AlongsideThor, Sunfire travelled to theAkkaba Metropoliswhere the Apocalypse Twins fully introduced themselves. In an act of mischief to damage the relationships in the Unity Division, the twins revealed that Wolverine and hisX-Forcehad secretly assassinated a child version of Apocalypse andArchangel, the twins' father.[67]\nThe Unity Division members ultimately found themselves divided, and Sunfire sided with Wolverine alongside Thor and Rogue.[68]Searching for Clan Akkaba, Sunfire and his teammates found Ozymandias inCairo, who led them to a base inSocotrawhere theAkkaba Nebulawas hidden. There, they fought the Horsemen of DeathSentryandDaken.[69]Sunfire andRoguefoundWolverine, after he had been crucified byDaken. Wolverine erroneously informed them about theScarlet Witchbetraying the team, causingSunfireto pair up with Rogue to stop her from calling the mutants to the Twins' ship.[70]they ultimately failed as Rogue killed the Scarlet Witch, who managed to sacrifice herself to cast a spell and gather all the mutants like the Apocalypse Twins had planned.[71]\nEarth was destroyed by theCelestialExitarin retaliation for the Celestial Gardener's death.[72]The surviving Apocalypse TwinEimincreated a mutant exclusiveplanetpopulated by the mutants the Scarlet Witch had collected. For years, Sunfire was kept hidden and locked in a pod in stasis alongside Wolverine, since they knew about the real reasons that had caused Earth's destruction. During this time they were guarded and tortured byBanshee.[73]They were rescued byHavokandKang the Conqueror'sChronos Corps, which allowed Sunfire to have his revenge against Banshee. Sunfire refused to work with Kang, but was knocked out by Wolverine before he could react. This allowedMagistrate Braddockto send their psyches to the past, to a time before the Scarlet Witch's death and Earth's destruction.[74]\nIn the past, the Unity Division put their differences aside as Sunfire reasoned with Rogue. As the Avengers attacked the Apocalypse Twins united, they unwillingly allowed Kang the Conqueror to absorb the Celestial power to become omnipotent.[75]Sunfire and Havok attempted to interrupt the process, but Kang managed to destroy Sunfire's body. However, for having had contact with the cosmic energies of the Celestial, Sunfire was reborn in a state of pure energy. With his new powers, Sunfire managed to obliterate the Apocalypse Twin's armada while Havok defeated Kang.[76]\nWhen Sunfire and otherAvengersfoughtPlantmanin New York, they came to know that the Red Skull had ascended to Red Onslaught, causing tremendous telepathic havok all over the world. Under Steve Roger's orders, Avengers and X-Men went toGenoshato fight Red Onslaught.[77]Sunfire was captured along with the other heroes and stored within one of Red Onslaught'sStark Sentinelsafter being shrunk withPym Particles.[78]They were freed when Magneto led ateam of super-villainsagainst the Stark Sentinels. The Scarlet Witch andDoctor Doomthen stopped Red Onslaught by casting an inversion spell which forceed a fragment of Charles Xavier's psyche to emerge and knock the villain out.[79]\nThe spell had inadvertently caused heroes and villains to have their moral axis inverted, including Sunfire. Sunfire joined the X-Men, at theJean Grey School for Higher Learning, to declare the unification of mutants and to reveal their new agenda of no longer wanting coexistence between humans and mutants. Instead, the mutant heroes wanted to stand above humans, being led byGenesis, who had become Apocalypse due to the inversion spell.[80]\nApparently still under Red Onslaught's influence, Sunfire teamed up withLongshotto retrieve a nuclear device that was in possession ofServal Industries' private superhero teamX-Factor.[81]Sunfire had the opportunity to reunite with his former allies, Polaris and Gambit. During the fight,Cyphermanaged to teleport Sunfire and Longshot to Tokyo, causing them to fail in their mission.[82]\nUnder the new Apocalypse's orders, Sunfire was among the X-Men who invaded New York City in the Celestial Ship. The X-Men violently defeatedCaptain Americain theAvengers Tower.[83]They also broadcast a warning forhumankind, proclaimed Manhattan their mutant capital and issued an ultimatum that all humans should be evacuated or perish. Clan Akkaba also devised a gene bomb to kill every non-mutant being on Earth.[84]\nSunfire and the X-Men got into a fight against theteamMagneto assembled with supervillains that had been inverted on Genosha. The X-Men defeated them,[85]but an invertedCarnagesacrificed himself to prevent the X-Men's gene bomb from fully detonating.[86]Later, theinverted Avengersattacked the X-Men. In the ensuing battle, an inverted Doctor Doom and Scarlet Witch, possessed by the spirit ofDaniel Drumm, cast another inversion spell that returned almost every hero and villain to normal, including Sunfire.[87]\nAfter the incident, Sunfire chose to make amends with X-Factor by approaching them to beg for forgiveness. Polaris invited him to join X-Factor in a mission in the Middle East to fightAmmit, the Soul Eater.[88]Sunfire's temper ignited a violent confrontation between X-Factor and Ammit. The demon goddess was ultimately defeated byDanger.[89]Sunfire returned with X-Factor to Serval Industries after the mission and did not rejoin the Avengers after that.[90]\nAfter it was revealed that theInhumanTerrigen Cloudswere toxic to mutants,[91]Sunfire joined Cyclops and his X-Men in his activities to protect mutantkind.[92]The X-Men planned to render one of the Terrigen Clouds inert usingAlchemy's powers. Sunfire carried Alchemy by flying through the mists. Although they were successful in nullifying its lethality, Alchemy tragically perished during the process.

Merzah reveals that he knows about Slo-Mo having witnessed certain moments betweenCortezand theAmerican Ace. He warns Slo-Mo that a time would be coming soon when he would be tempted to reveal Cortez's secret to the rest of the group, but he urges him not to once the time came. Slo-Mo was constantly tempted to reveal Frank's secret because, as a black man, he was the lowest person in the social hierarchy of the unit. If he revealed Frank's secret, that would all change as Cortez would become the unit's outcast, however, Slo-Mo did do his best to keep his word to Merzah.\nIn the present day,Steven Rogers (Earth-616)is urgently summoned to the Dept. of Defence's headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama. Here he learns about the secret nature of Operation Firefly, a project which holds a level fourteen security classification. Operation Firefly was a secret project of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and was run concurrently with a number of other projects which were aimed at a singular goal. One of these other projects, which Captain America is familiar with, was an intelligence directive known as Project Alberta. In July of 1944 the Captain had travelled to Wendover Army Airfield in Utah to meet with a Colonel Ledford to discuss the transfer ofTaxi Taylorfrom the Crazy SUE's. Captain America felt that Taxi and hisT-Mechwere imperative to the continued success of the SUES' operations in Northern France. The Colonel divulges that the SUES' operations in Europe and the Pacific are merely training grounds and that they are being groomed for a much bigger operation. He reveals that in 1940 the government began a very important and expensive project that will eventually turn the tide of the war. The Crazy SUES are an important part of a highly classified operation known as Project Alberta. Taylor has been reassigned to an intelligence gathering under the direct command of Ledford. The rest of the SUES are ordered to continue with their mission, with a particular emphasis on the progress of Captain Flame. Ledford gives the Captain a set of instructions to follow for Cortez's development, stating that \"you're going to have to push him to his absolute limit.\"\nSlo-Mo Jones continues to relate the history of the Crazy SUES to Alyssa, claiming that she, as theYoung Avenger'sgranddaughter, is the only person he would trust with this information. In late August of 1944 the unit liberated Paris despite harsh resistance from the Nazis. The men decided to go chasing some girls during a little downtime after Paris had been liberated. WhenCaptain Stronginvited American Ace along he refused, stating that he was a happily married man. This comment greatly upset Cortez, who stormed off amidst the confused stares of the rest of the unit. Soon after the unit continued to move across the French countryside, a much more dangerous task without the services of Taxi Taylor and T-Mech. The unit acted as reconnaissance for the 101st airborne. The unit was ambushed in a small French village, withMoon Manbeing shot in the throat. The unit was pinned down under heavy fire while Slo-Mo and Cortez watched from a position nearby. Slo-Mo recognized that the SUES would have little chance if they did not do something to save them, watching as theInvisible Manwas also shot, though not fatally. Despite Slo-Mo's pleading, Cortez said that he wasn't able to do it anymore, that he just couldn't go out there. Running out of options and wanting to save his friends, Slo-Mo threatens Cortez by saying that unless he goes out there he will tell the rest of the unit about his relationship with American Ace and that he is a homosexual. Slo-Mo recognized that he had betrayed Frank, just as Merzah said he would, but he hadn't seen any other way to save everyone else. He knew at that moment that Frank was going to die and that it was his betrayal that caused it.\nSlo-Mo ends his recounting of events here and reminds Alyssa that she made him a promise. He then hands her a list of names and addresses, telling her to visit them in order to understand the rest. Alyssa then leaves, saying that she will come back tomorrow. When she gets outside of Slo-Mo's house, however, she is met by two government agents claiming that she needs to go with them. They take her phone and shove her inside of a waiting limousine where she comes face-to-face with none other than Captain America andNick Fury."

She first encountered Havok in Mexico, where he andWolverinewere caught up in a gunfight. Posing as a simple bystander, she waited until Havok used his powers. Once she had confirmed his identity and abilities, she shot him and Wolverine with bullets laced with bubonic plague.\nSwitching identities to that of a red-headed nurse, she took Havok to a hospital staffed by Meltdown's agents. When he awoke, she told him that Wolverine was dead, and attempted to use various drugs and subliminal messages to control him. However, Havok resisted the attempted brainwashing, and McKenzie was forced to use alternate means to manipulate him. Since he refused to believe the story about Wolverine's death, she began to feed him enough information about Meltdown's plot to make him believe that Wolverine was being held hostage, and that she was a helpless innocent who had become wrapped up in a web of espionage.\nMcKenzie led Havok across Eastern Europe, and then to a nuclear reactor inIndia. Spending so much time with him in her false persona, she began to develop genuine feelings for him, and began to hope he would somehow survive Meltdown's plan. When Havok and Meltdown finally confronted each other, McKenzie stepped between them, and Meltdown incinerated her with an energy blast. Whether this was a genuine effort to warn Havok of Meldown's threat, or a calculated sacrifice to enrage Havok sufficiently to ensure the success of Meldown's plan to absorb his energy is unclear.\nAfter the battle, Havok mourned McKenzie, and Wolverine chose to keep to himself what he had learned about her, letting his friend continue to believe she had been the innocent hero she'd pretended to be.[1]"

Reconverted into an agent ofHydra, Trefkov apparently killed Ernst Sablinov inTokyoand took his corpse, emotionally affecting Silvija. In reality, Ernst was still alive and Trefkov attached him to a machine to use as a living battle computer.\nErnst's twin brother,Fritz Sablinov, posed as Ernst to allow himself to be captured and attract Trefkov's attention. Fritz was tortured, but convinced Trefkov to create a faction in Hydra, theGenesis Coalition, which would then secede, destroy Hydra and take its place, with Trefkov in command - or at least that was the plan that Fritz told Trefkov. In reality, Fritz intended to use this maneuver to destroy Hydra and the Coalition; but Fritz spent several years undercover as co-leader of the Coalition and went insane.\nOver the next few years, the Coalition initiated several plans that Trefkov ensured followed the Reich's ideology, including the development of hybrid supersoldiers, the use of cyborgs to attempt to captureMount Wundagore, and various plans that would harm Hydra. Hydra's leader,Baron Strucker, hunted down those who deserted his ranks to go to the Coalition; and as soon as Silver Sable learned that Trefkov was with the Coalition, she went the extra mile to find him. Trefkov had several problems with an ambitious Coalition officer,Dmitri Petrovich, and eventually had him arrested for his constant failures, because the Coalition was going to launch an attack onBosniapretending to be Hydra so that Hydra would be blamed, and he didn't want Petrovich to ruin it. Petrovich managed to escape and lured Sable to the Coalition so she'd destroy it, although he died in the process, and then Fritz tried to convince Sable not to interfere because he had started a plan to both destroy Hydra and the Coalition; instead Sable allowed Fritz to capture her, much to Trefkov's glee. During the battle in Bosnia, Trefkov attempted to kill Baron Strucker, but failed; and then Sable reached Trefkov'sbattlecruiserand killed him in cold blood; shortly afterward, Fritz was also killed in battle. The deaths of Petrovich, Sablinova, and Trefkov marked the end of the Coalition, and for a time Sable had moral problems for having killed Trefkov.\nAs a Nazi.\nIvan Trefkov was a member of theNazi PartyofGermany[6]and war criminal[8]who escaped the country when the Nazis were defeated in theWorld War II.[6]After 1959,Ernst Sablinov, veteran of the war[12]and former intelligence minister ofSymkaria, foundedWild Pack,[8]a military unit[13]of Nazi hunters,[8]especially war criminals,[14][13]under the orders of the King of Symkaria.[5]Ernst's wife,Anastasia, found her husband's work worrying[14][5]and tried to hide the details from her young daughterSilvija, wishing to keep her away from the violence. When Silvija was seven years old, she saw Trefkov talking to other Nazi agents about a plan to assassinate her father and ran to warn him.[5]In doing so, she inadvertently revealed to the Nazis where her father's base was. The Nazis began a firefight against the Wild Pack, during which Anastasia was killed in the crossfire,[5][13]explicitly shot by Trefkov.[8][14][12][5]Trefkov escaped through the sewers, swearing[5]that he would track down and take revenge on Sablinov.[5][12]Anastasia expired in her preteen daughter's arms, asking the little girl to swear not to continue her father's violent fight;[13][5]Silvija agreed to stop violence, but only after avenging Anastasia's death.[5]After that, Ernst trained Silvija in all kinds of forms of combat,[5][14]so that she would join the Wild Pack in her teens and became Ernst's second-in-command;[13]or so she thought: Secretly, Ernst's supposedly missing brother,Fritz,[5]was his right-hand man, posing as Ernst at any time.[3]The shock of losing her mother at the hands of Trefkov, and the efforts to perfect herself in defiance of her mother's wishes, caused Silvija's hair to prematurely turn silver.[5][13]\nDeserting to Hydra.\nStabbing Ernst Sablinova.\nTrefkov later joined the neo-Nazi criminal organizationHydra,[5][13][6][15][16]led byBaron Strucker, at a time when multiple factions of the Nazis where reappearing.[5]Both Ernst Sablinov and his daughter Silvija Sablinova jumped at the chance to hunt down Trefkov,[5][13]and Ernst was also especially eager to destroy Hydra. Sablinov's intelligence found Trefkov inTokyo,Japan. Ernst organized the operation so that he could go alone after Trefkov, and thus be able to kill him in revenge for the death of his wife, with Silvija and the rest of the team as a mere diversion for Hydra troops. However, Silvija decided to defy her father's orders and follow him. This led to[5]a distraction by Ernst at a critical moment, which gave Trefkov the opportunity to stab him,[17][5]apparently killing him.[17][13][5][12][14]Trefkov then escaped[5][13]with Ernst's body,[5]despite Silvija's efforts to stop him.[9]Silvija ordered his men to finish off each of the enemies,[5][9]but Trefkov had the numerical superiority and a boat, and gave orders to his agents to sacrifice their lives until he had escaped by ship acrossTokyo Bay. An agent of Silvija,Yanover, warned her that Trefkov had surely set a trap in the hold, but, emotionally affected by the loss of her father, Silvija dismissed his advice, insisted on her orders, and caused her own soldiers' deaths,[9]while Trefkov managed to flee with Ernst's body.[5][9][18]Silvija cried, affected by the situation, the last time she cried for a long time[5]and, convinced that Ernst had died because emotions had clouded both his and her judgment, she decided not to be guided by her feelings in the future.[13][14]Adopting the name \"Silver Sable\",[13]she took command of the Wild Pack, turning it into an elite mercenary corps,[8][13][14]and swore revenge on Trefkov.[14]\nIn reality, Trefkov had kidnapped Ernst and kept him alive to use him as a living battle computer,[3][12]connecting him to advanced Hydra technology[3]to take advantage of Ernst's tactical genius.[3][13]Ernst tried hard to sabotage this effort by focusing his mind for years on gambits that he knew were destined to fail, so that Hydra would lose the battles in which they trusted him. During his captivity, Ernst was confident that one day his daughter would find him and rescue him.[3]Trefkov also knew that Silvija was still alive and that one day she would come for him.[18]\nTorturing Fritz Sablinov.\nAfter Ernst's funeral, Fritz Sablinov decided to infiltrate Hydra, taking advantage of the fact that her brother's body had not been found. Posing as Ernst, Fritz attacked a Hydra outpost, hoping to attract Trefkov's attention, and was captured, then brought before Trefkov, as Fritz himself had anticipated. Trefkov had Fritz tortured for months, without telling him anything about Ernst's body; but during his ordeal, Fritz developed a desperate plan to destroy Hydra, which he presented to Trefkov[3]as his way of joining him[12]and defecting from the Wild Pack:[8]Create a faction within Hydra,Genesis Coalition, to eventually secede,[12][8]stealing equipment and personnel from Strucker, and seeking a time to annihilate Hydra to take its place[3]when in reality Fritz's plan was to provoke a civil war[12]that would destroy both organizations.[3][12]Trefkov however was convinced by the plan and supported Fritz,[3]after which Trefkov personally convinced a former faction of Hydra to form the Genesis Coalition.[1]\nThanks in part to acquisition specialistDmitri Petrovich,[9]the Genesis Coalition obtained some of Hydra's most advanced technology[19]at a time when Hydra was especially weakened following the death of Strucker.[15][16]The Coalition took advantage of the moment to openly secede[19]before Strucker resurrected and reorganized Hydra, opposed by the Genesis Coalition.[15][16]Becoming a Hydra splinter group,[20][13][15][16]the Genesis Coalition was persecuted by Strucker, who branded them traitors.[19]\nwith other Genesis Coalition leaders.\nTrefkov and a large group from the Genesis Coalition, including Fritz Sablinov, Petrovich, and geneticist[21]Franz Lubischt,[7]established a secret base hidden behind a waterfall[7]in the lush rainforest ofSouth America, with multiple low-level agents and scientists at their command. The Genesis Coalition captured humans and animals to subject them to[21]very painful experiments[21][7]in an attempt to create extraordinarily powerful hybrid super-soldiers, with support from international investors and advanced equipment stolen from Hydra.[21]Trefkov made sure of maintaining Nazi ideology in the Genesis Coalition.[7]\nIn the South American base.\nPetrovich had attracted Silver Sable's attention onLong Island,[17]and she sent the mercenaryPaladinto track him down.[22]Paladin found Petrovich in South America with the Genesis Coalition, and reported to Sable,[21][13]who traveled there with the Wild Pack to stop them; the purpose of the operation was to stop Lubischt 's experiments[7]since Silver Sable did not know that Trefkov was with the Genesis Coalition.[1][13]The Wild Pack infiltrated the base, but set off alarms; Sablinova and Trefkov reproached Petrovich for his security system having allowed an intruder to get so far. Petrovich assured them that he would eliminate the intruders quickly, even after discovering that they were Silver Sable and the Wild Pack; Trefkov insisted that Petrovich was to, or Trefkov would punish Petrovich by putting him in Lubischt 's hands for his experiments. Trefkov left the base then, but Petrovich failed: Sable and the Wild Pack stopped the experiments, freed the test subjects, and killed Lubischt before destroying the base. They would have also killed Petrovich, but he managed to escape from her by confusing Sable[7]when he told her that her father was alive.[7][13][14]Trefkov worked with smugglerLeviathan, previously linked to Hydra, to provide stolen Hydra technology to the Genesis Coalition through Petrovich. Trefkov intended to attack severalEastern Europeancountries with weaponry provided by Leviathan.[1]Petrovich also stolea mobile base from Hydrafor the Genesis Coalition,[9]and they bought a shipment ofCyberwarriors, mindless weaponized cyborgs, fromHarlan Rykerand his people;[10]Trefkov planned to send the Cyberwarriors on an attack onWundagore Mountain, inTransia,[9]which they intended to use as the Genesis Coalition headquarters from where they could expand their base, ambitiously considering an invasion toLatveria.[18]Trefkov was also satisfied with the mobile base stolen by Petrovich.[9]\nDuring the \"Cyberwar.\"\nSilver Sable tracked down Leviathan through his contacts with Petrovich,[1]and Leviathan revealed to Silver Sable that Trefkov was with the Genesis Coalition.[1][13]Shortly after, collaborating withDeathlokagainst Harlan Ryker inParis, Sable discovered that the Genesis Coalition had purchased Cyberwarriors, and decided to focus her efforts on pursuing them.[10]Baron Strucker's Hydra also tracked down the Genesis Coalition,[9]hiring the mercenary groupNext Waveto recover the stolen base.[9][23][24][13]\nSilver Sable and Next Wave simultaneously attacked the Genesis Coalition base; Petrovich reacted by sealing off the affected areas and sending some of the Cyberwarriors there. Trefkov ordered the area to be flooded during the fighting, since this would kill the intruders while the Cyberwarriors, who did not need to breathe, would survive; but at the same time he assigned another group of Cyberwarriors,[9]thirty in total, to the mission of attacking Transia.[18]Fritz Sablinov suggested personally taking care of his niece Silver Sable, and Trefkov did not object, since he did not doubt his colleague's loyalty.[9]However, seeing that there was danger, and although Petrovich insisted that the Cyberwarriors would be enough to end the threat, Petrovich and Trefkov evacuated towards Transia in a mobile battlestation. Meanwhile, Fritz Sablinov tried to keep Silver Sable at bay. In Transia, however, the cyborgSiegeattacked the Genesis Coalition Cyberwarriors and, due to his appearance, everyone initially took him for another Cyberwarrior, granting him the element of surprise. The Cyberwarriors then faced theKnights of Wundagore, defenders of Wundagore, and were unable to gain the advantage. Petrovich and Trefkov retreated, with the latter criticizing the former for yet another failure, while the Wild Pack arrived to help the Knights against the Cyberwarriors. All Genesis Coalition Cyberwarriors were destroyed on Wundagore by the Knights, the Wild Pack and Siege, with the participation of Next Wave.[18]\nTrefkov had been at odds with Petrovich for some time.\nThe Genesis Coalition settled in an old underground base abandoned by Hydra, and there they set up a plan to cause a war inBosniaand blame it on Hydra[11]by sending Genesis Coalition agents disguised as Hydra agents. Fritz Sablinov had developed this plan, with the idea of provoking a conflict that would destroy Hydra and the Genesis Coalition in a large-scale war with multiple collateral casualties[3]and the participation of theU.S.military and law enforcement agencySHIELD,[3]but Trefkov believed that the plan would leave the Genesis Coalition unscathed and in a privileged position to obtain the spoils of Hydra. However, Trefkov wanted to get rid of any possible impedance during this operation, including Silver Sable and also Dmitri Petrovich, whom Trefkov considered too incompetent for the authority he had in the Genesis Coalition. Trefkov sent hitmanDeadpoolafter Silver Sable,[11]although Fritz convinced him to[3]order Deadpool to capture her alive, claiming that if she died, her Wild Pack would seek revenge and they would have a bigger problem, while if they captured her, they could hold her hostage. Trefkov accepted, although he would have preferred to see Silver Sable dead. Simultaneously, Trefkov had Petrovich arrested at the base, sending him to a cell until they could decide whether it was better to execute him, or hand him over to Strucker as a bargaining chip.[11]\nDeadpool failed to defeat Silver Sable, and revealed to her that the Genesis Coalition had hired him.[11]Additionally, Petrovich escaped thanks to several Genesis Coalition agents being on his side.[25]Petrovich attacked Silver Sable in Symkaria[25][13][8]in a daring plan doomed to failure; Petrovich planned it so that she would defeat him and then he pretended to be intimidated and agreed to take Sable and her Wild Pack to the Genesis Coalition's secret base where her father was. Petrovich hoped that Sable would kill Trefkov for having attacked and kidnapped Ernst Sablinov; and then Petrovich's followers would kill Sable and his Wild Pack, so that Petrovich could take over the Genesis Coalition.[25]At the base, however, Fritz Sablinov intercepted Sable, explaining his presence[3]and assassinating Petrovich[3][13]before he could insist that Ernst Sablinova was alive and at the base. Implying that the confusion was due to his own resemblance to Ernst, Fritz falsely told Silver Sable that Trefkov had killed Ernst, and told him that his plan to attack Bosnia was vital to destroying Hydra and the Genesis Coalition; and then he convinced Silver to allow herself to be captured, with the Wild Pack, so that Fritz would take them to Trefkov so he could protect them. Silver was suspicious, but accepted, keeping two secrets: That his enemy and occasional ally theForeignerwas infiltrating the Genesis Coalition base in order to free her, and that a second group of Wild Pack, theIntruders, would go to Bosnia to stop the conflict.[3]\nSable and the Wild Pack were locked[3][13]on a submarine that Trefkov was using as a base in theBlack Seafor the military operation. Trefkov agreed to keep them alive as hostages, but assured Silver that he intended to kill her for all the inconvenience she had caused, and that he regretted not having killed her at the same time as Ernst (Trefkov was also lying, because he knew that Ernst was still alive). Silver told him that SHIELD and Baron Strucker would go after him; but Trefkov told him that he had incorporated them into his plan.[3]\nBy then, Trefkov's agents had already begun the attack on Bosnia,[25]although SHIELD had noted that their tactics were too mediocre to be obeying Strucker. Strucker, for his part, saw the attack not only as a ploy, but also as an insult, and decided to go to Bosnia to combat the Genesis Coalition forces, all following Sablinova and Trefkov's plan. Trefkov personally traveled to Bosnia aboard abattlecruiserstolen from Hydra to maintain the deception, with the purpose of using it to destroy Strucker and his people before Strucker could realize that the vehicle was not manned by agents of Hydra. One of Strucker's soldiers pushed him to protect him, and Strucker understood the deception, immediately ordering the cruiser to be destroyed. Sablinova realized the problem and contacted Trefkov to have Trefkov activate the cloaking of the cruiser before Strucker destroyed it.[3]\nSilver Sable was eager to confront Trefkov...\n...in a final fight.\nMeanwhile, in the submarine, the Foreigner rescued Sable and the Wild Pack,[3][13]and took them to Ernst.[3]Sable rescued her father,[3][12][14][13]and quickly developed a plan: Just as Trefkov used technology stolen from Hydra to approach Hydra and attack them by surprise, Sable and the Wild Pack stole one of Trefkov's mini-submarine to reach Trefkov's battlecruiser without being detected. Once on board, while the Wild Pack dealt with the defenses, Sable arrived at the command room and confronted Trefkov. Trefkov defended himself with a semi-automatic weapon, but Sable dodged the blasts and pummeled the man he hated,[3]breaking his bones with her bare hands and seeking to kill him.[3][13]Trefkov resisted and drew a knife, but Sable took it from him and stabbed him in the belly,[3]killing him.[3][14][13]\nFritz Sablinov immediately realized that Trefkov had stopped responding, and teleported to the command room, where he confronted Sable, also accusing her of having ruined his plan with the Intruders' intervention in Bosnia. The Foreigner[3]killed Fritz Sablinov,[3][8][13]and the day ended with the apparent destruction of the Genesis Coalition, albeit Strucker and Hydra escaped.[3]\nTrefkov incorporated Nazi ideology to the Genesis Coalition.\n\nTrefkov was a competent leader of an underground criminal organization[7]and a good strategist, thou not as good as geniuses likeBaron Strucker.[3]He was able to hide from Nazi hunters for decades and to obtain adequate funding for his goals.[21]\nTrefkov demonstrated a number of other skills, including the capacity to navigate in a motor boat[18]and to operate a huge flying battlecruiser stolen from Hydra.[3]In combat, he has been seen using melee weapons,[3]fireweapons of different types[3][5]and military gear.[18]He was able to fight without weapons to some extent, although in his old age he was not a match for Silver Sable. However, he was able to withstand punishment without complaining, keeping on fighting even when several of his bones had been broken.[3]"

HowardFirstConan the Barbarian#28(April, 1973)\nThe founders of Turan were adventurers fromHyrkania, and theTuraniansremained proud of their Hyrkanian heritage. Originally a minor state situated at the western shores of theVilayet Sea, it grew to become a major empire.[6]\nBy the time ofConan, Turan was in an expansion phase. The rulers ofBrythunia,Shem,Koth, andZamoraall paid tribute to their eastern overlord. Itsarmieshad threatened the borders ofCorinthia,Hyperborea,Nemedia,Ophir,Stygia, andVendhya. The entire Vilayet Sea, 2000 miles (3218.69 kilometers) in length and 300 miles wide (482.8 kilometers), had become the domain of theTuranian Navy.[6]\nTuran entered at some point a conflict known as the \"Great WarwithKhitai\". Little is known of the conflict, apart thatAmirofKhawarizmparticipated on the Turanian side, and that he hinted that the conflict caused massive casualties to the Khitans.[7]\nWhile resting in a rain forest south of the Vilayet Sea, Conan was attacked by a lakhmu, a native giant reptile which was then killed by the StygianThutmekri, even though Conan himself got stuck in quicksand. The Cimmerian managed to drag himself out and came across the tortured Stygian, who told him about the religious idol he stole fromZembabweiand the Witch-Dancers sent to kill him. Conan then confronted the bearerM'Gorah, who was actually possessed by Thutmekri's enemyDalboor, and eventually defeated the golden fanged apeZembaitself, freeingHelgi.[8]\nAfter enlisting as a mercenary in the Turanian Army, Conan participated in the campaign against the rebelhill-men tribes, who ambushed his party, whittling them down to a handful of men.Captain Malthuzcalled for a retreat and the group took refuge in a cave. The hill-men trapped them inside, and offered a bargain: a Turanian champion will fight a hill-man to the death. Conan took Malthuz's place and eventually defeated their champion, who died buried by a landslide, so that the Turanians were allowed to leave in peace.[9]\nBack in Turan fromWan Tengri, Conan andBourtaiheaded through the desert southeast of the Vilayet Sea, when they encountered a man hassled by bandits. They rode to the man's rescue, but were too late; with the man's dying breath he tells them about the Azure Eye, a great jewel from the city ofKara-Shehr. A sandstorm consumed them, and when it dispersed, they found the lost city and began searching through the ruins.[10]\nA short time later, while Conan and his Turanian party were escortingPrincess Yolindathrough the northern hills of Turan, they were attacked by rebel raiders. The raiders defeated them and brought them back to theValley of the Sun.[11]\nConan and Turghol returned to theTuranian Steppesjoining the Bahari Kozaks, a mixed population of peasants and fugitives who was warring against the Turanian Army. As their village was accidentally set ablaze and their hetman killed, Conan was appointed as their new leader and traveled to the Turanian camp where the survived Kozak families were being kept. Imprisoned byPrince Yezdigerd, the Cimmerian managed to escape and free the prisoners byTania, Turghol's wife. Returning to their burned out village, they were visited by a man from the Dyari Kozaks. As Conan offered him to join forces against the Turanian horde, the Free Companions and theSword-Thief Isparanawere spotted approaching from the steppes.[12]\nAfter killingMiloand imprisoningZorka, Conan got the Free Companions by his side against the Turanian empire. Conan then brought together six tribes of Kozaks and reunited with his old friendZula.[13]\nAfter he was reported thatGrimmhad assumed command of the Turanian troops on the steppes, Conan nearly blanched and remembered when he first met the hellish warrior, many years before inCimmeria.[14]\nConan then rode to Northern Turan in search of allies. Conan's forces were suddenly assaulted by the immense magical Hand ofNergal, which decimated them until turning back into mist and vanishing back towardYaralet. He then allied withHobar'sKezanks to join forces withPrince Thannof Yaralet against Turan.[15]\nConan then returned to the Kozak camp withRed SonjaandGonar. Confronted by several people who knew him well, the mirror-Conan told stories of their shared past to convince them of his true nature, but then mirror-Conan and Gonar exposed Fafnir's demon hand, making the Kozaks suspect him to be evil. With their suspicion aroused, mirror-Conan challenged Fafnir; they fought evenly, but when Fafnir recognized and began to voice that \"Conan\" and \"Sonja\" were using their opposite sword hands, mirror-Red Sonja stabbed Fafnir from behind, seemingly killing him.[citation needed]\nThrough this victory, mirror-Conan seemingly proved himself to be the Kozak's hitman, and he then grabbed Conan's woman,Roxelana, to prove himself to her through her other methods. Zula and Turgohl took Fafnir away to bury him, but he quickly revived due to the magical power running through his body. Fafnir shared the knowledge of \"Conan\" fighting with the wrong hand, strengthening Zula and Turgohl's suspicions, but then Gonar, having followed and listened to them, suspecting that Fafnir may not have perished, extracted their souls into one of his little mirrors, leaving their bodies apparently without life. Meanwhile, the real Conan and Sonja continued their trek back to the Kozak camp.[16]\nOnce arrived, the real Conan and Red Sonja fought their mirrored counterparts; meanwhile, the souls of Fafnir, Turghol and Zula were reunited to their bodies and Tuzun Thune was eventually destroyed. Conan reunited with his wife and was once again acclaimed as the Kozak leader.[17]\nSome time later,Jumainfiltrated the Kozak camp and persuaded Conan to look forPrincess Yolindain the city ofKherdpur.[18]\nYezdigerd eventually succeeded his father as king of Turan.\nTuran maintained many important port cities, the most significant being its capitalAghrapur. Almost equal in fame is the trading city ofZamboula, the westernmost outpost of the Empire.[6][verification needed]\nIn Zamboula, a subordinate ruler reigned over a mixed populations of Stygians and Shemites. A slave force from Darfar continues to practice cannibalism. The Turanian marketplaces offer slaves from distant lands.[6][verification needed]\nThis proud empire still faces internal threats. There are pirate strongholds in the Vilayet, and Kozaki raiders prey on provincial cities. The government and military have repeatedly attempted to eliminate these groups to little lasting effect.[6][verification needed]\nOne of Turan's dishes was the Turanian kebab.[19]Specialities in theEastern Desertincluded flatbreads and a thin brew calledShaki.[20]\nThe people of Turan spoke Hyrkanian.[7]\nInZamboula, the lower classes worshipedHanuman.[21]A pagan sect in Zamboula had children strangled for holy sacrifice,[22]presumably worshipingYajur(see \"Strabo's religion\").\nThe name ofYenagrawas invoked byHamar Kur.[23]\nHoruswas seemingly worshiped or at least acknowledged during theHyborian Agecirca 10,000 BC, by the people of an unnamed small city in theEastern DesertofTuran, as one of them mentioned \"the resurrection of Horus\". All the inhabitants of this city were slain byRune, the Dark God, whom they had come to revere as a god.[20]"

Upon his arrival Xuthl sucked the squealing sorcerer that summoned him into his flaming embrace, and then playfully spat out his burnt bones. The Devourer, unimpressed by Xuthl's antics, requested a host of Xuthl's Shedu in return for a favor to be repaid later. After the Devourer concealed the glowing orb containing the Shedu in his cloak he then departed on his mission to destroy Conan. Arriving atBhoraji, and just prior to attackingKaleb the Destroyerin an attempt to seize the vast eldritch power of his daughterSolaise, the Devourer loosed the Shedu from their containment in the orb. The Shedu killed at leastone helpless possessed villager, several of Conan's men, toyed with the barbarian by making Anneka threaten to slit her wrists, and then assumed the form of a herd of wild boar and later animating an entire hillock with their essence to battle Conan. Meanwhile, the Devourer trackedKalebandhis mysterious daughterto the temple of Mitra they were hiding in. Leaving his daughter in the basement to check on things upstairs Kaleb discovered the Devourer in the temple and a pitched battle began.[8]\nAfter a fierce battle, Kaleb the Destroyer became the only \"mortal\" to defeat the Devourer in physical combat. Impaling him on the outstretched arm of an idol of Mitra, Kaleb left the Devourer for dead. Meanwhile Conan finally defeated the Shedu with the help of the Footslave of theElder Gods, using theFootslave's totem. Solaise acquired her pet catSedrick, whom she constantly talked to and who helped her access her dread powers.[9]\nThe Devourer's corpse hung from the arm of the holy statue while the townspeople of Bhoraji looted the wrecked temple. A man namedDimitrisaw the Devourer's sword and against his friend's warnings seized it, thinking only that such an ornate, well crafted weapon would bring a good price. Lightning suddenly crashed down from the heavens and the villages fled as a terrible transformation begins. Dimitri was struck dead instantly, but in his place the Devourer lived again.[10]\nThe Devourer then approachedBahktand transformed him as his Dark Apostle, to use his deep hatred and loathing of Conan in his soul.[11]\nInSyreb, Wraarl visited Prince Ihram, telling him to be patient, that everything was going as planned and to do nothing, unless instructed otherwise. He later met Solaise andSedrick.[12]\nAfter Bahkt reported what he had done toRed Sonja, the Devourer was pleased with his work and gave him more souls.[13]\nThe Devourer of Souls then watched with amusement from the edge of the woods asConanand his one time allyKaleb the Destroyerwaged a pitched battle. Determining it would be to his advantage to bring them to the river, he summoned thefelineandSolaiseran after her pet into a portal in the air, soon followed by the Cimmerian and the Aesir. After the terrible truth was revealed to Kaleb in theForest of the Eternal Verities, the Devourer appeared to them with Solaise and Sedrick the Cat in his arms, revealing something of his plans and how he concealed his presence from Conan for so long in order to piece together the truth about the sacred child. He had somehow seduced Solaise into helping him to seize the power of the Elder Gods. As Conan moved in to fight the Devourer for Solaise, Kaleb struck him down, desiring to face the Devourer alone. The Devourer then proffered a knife for Kaleb to finish off Conan, pushing him to fulfill his destiny and protect the child, saving it from the fate the Devourer had in store, and regaining his youth and power. Therefore he must kill Conan as a man and not the being empowered by the Elder Gods that he had become. Kaleb stood indecisive. The forest erupted in flames and rising from the conflagration is the embodiment of all evil. Wrarrl, mounted on his winged steed, Solaise and Sedrick in the crook of his arm, flew off into the night sky, flaming sword held aloft.[14]\nRiding upon his flying steed the Devourer carried Solaise and Sedrick the Cat intoArallu, Land of the Evil Dead, for the purpose of consultingThulsa Doom, who related to him the origins of the cat. Thulsa Doom then explained to the Devourer that the cat contained the power, but lacked the will to use it. Solaise had the will, but only a fraction of the power. In gratitude for his help, the Devourer shattered Doom's chains, granting him the freedom to wander Arallu at will. He then turned his steed and found theFootslave of the Elder Godswandering an ancient cavern deep beneath the earth under an inland sea. Wrarrl lured the Footslave to him by calling out his human name, Maxmelle, which no one had used in ten thousand years. On another plane of existence, the Devourer then began an unholy ritual involving Solaise, her cat Sedrick, and the Foot-slave. A wave of the 'white death' swept across the area onEarthwhere Conan's comrades were awaiting his return. This coincided with Sedrick being returned to human form. The Devourer said Sedrick could remain human on one condition: he must give the Devourer his power, so Wraarl completed his ritual and absorbed the power of the Elder Gods into his frame. He released a huge fireball, propelling it through the dimensional barriers towards his intended victims a world away. Thulsa Doom's magic protected Conan and his allies from a death dealing fireball, unleashed upon them by the Devourer after he attained the power of the Elder Gods. Wrarrl, finally giving in to his hatred of Conan and his fury, unleashed a blast of eldritch energy so powerful it created a mushroom cloud, but theGolden Sword of the Elder Godsprotected Conan and his allies, who remained untouched. In a fit of rage, the Devourer childishly flung a portion of his destructive power southward, destroyingEl Shah Maddocand engulfingSyrebin a city-wide inferno; to the north, another small kingdom was destroyed beneath the massive tidal waves tossed up by a usually quiet sea. Furious, the Devourer teleported away. High atop theKenzankian Mountainsthe Devourer bellowed his pain, driven insane by the agony of the power of the Elder Gods inside him. For once, the Devourer had grossly miscalculated. Solaise felt no pain because she was an innocent child, her virtue intact. The Devourer had no such purity and therefore was in mind-numbing agony.Xuthlsoon appeared to the now god-like Devourer, demanding repayment of the debt owed him for the loan of his Shedu. In order to repay his debt to Xuthl the Devourer was commanded to find the most beautiful and unspoilt maiden in the western kingdoms and sacrifice her unto Xuthl, but first the Devourer must win the girl to himself by love. The Devourer then found the most perfect and unblemished maiden in the land and teleported to southern Aquilonian province ofPoitainto begin his seduction of her. He created a mortal vessel for himself called Acheron, hiding the Devourer's body in a sepulcher beneath the manor he had taken possession of. MeetingCount Trocero, Baron of the province of Poitain, Acheron was presented to Trocero's daughterSephra. Over the next few weeks Acheron began his seduction of Sephra, proceeding apace with the girl falling in love with the Devourer's human guise. However, the Devourer soon discovered himself falling in love with the girl as well. Sephra's father refused to allow her to see Acheron any longer. Sephra then snuck out of her father's castle and met with Acheron, who was just debating abandoning his life as the Devourer altogether. Just as they revealed their feelings to one another, Xuthl blasted the girl into a blackened skeleton and charred meat, driving the Devourer insane. Acheron took an axe from the wall and proceeds down into the crypt, fully intending to slay his demonic half and sever his ties with his dark past forever. Conan and his allies arrived at the manor outside and battled their way through an army of skeletal warriors. They made their way to the catacombs beneath the manor, while Conan and the mentally unbalanced Devourer and Conan squared off in a titanic battle that carried them across worlds. At last, Conan finally slew the dread demon with the magical sword in a thunderous explosion of power. Sometime later, the Devourer's human incarnation, Acheron, awakened on a beach on one of theIslands of Pearl. Much to his surprise, he was both alive and human. Xuthl appeared to Acheron and explained that what destroyed the Devourer also saved him. The humanity the Devourer learned in his walk amongst the mortals was his crippling flaw in the battle with Conan. Using that flaw to destroy him was Xuthl's plan all along. The Devourer's demonic shell was destroyed by the magic blade in Conan's hands thus the only part of the Devourer left for Xuthl to save was his human side: he took the liberty of restoring Acheron to his original form as a matter of professional courtesy. Xuthl flowed into a nearby bottle half buried in the sand, which Acheron promptly corked. Acheron wandered away, bottle in hand, telling the demon lord he intends to find a warm place in the sun.[15]\nOver the years, Acheron almost completely forgot who he was. When Conan and his Free Companions docked at his island, he welcomed them and was instantly enchanted with Conan's allyIsparana. Later that night, some of Conan's crew ambushed him and took his bottle. As Jubal of Venzia burst into flames, Xuthl was released once more. The demon proceeded to incinerate several of the crewmen, but Acheron raised the bottle into the air, and Xuthl was pulled back into it. The bottle was corked anew, and under Conan's instruction, it was put in a sack, weighed down with rocks, and dropped into the ocean after they had set sail again. Acheron joined Conan and his crew, although the spirit of the Devourer rumbled just beneath his conscious mind.[16]\nAsConanand Free Companions set up camp inDagoth Hill, Acheron andIsparanacontinued to grow closer, and one night they consummated their love. However, that same night, Acheron was awakened from his sleep and drawn into the catacombs, where he found the empty armor of the Devourer. Isparana awakened and followed Acheron, while Conan heard their voices and investigated. Conan threatened Acheron to keep away from the armor, which caused Isparana to draw her sword to defend him. As Conan and Isparana struggled, Acheron fell the rest of the way under the sway of the call of the Devourer, and he donned the helmet. After putting on the entire suit of armor, Acheron was transformed both physically and mentally back into the Devourer. The Devourer burst forth from the catacombs, slaughtering any of Conan's crew he encountered. He callously swatted Isparana aside and proclaimed himself the new lord of Dark Valley.[1]"
