Warlock asks why he was awakened from his cocoon before the proper time, and Khan answers that the time isexactlyright. As Warlock threatens Kang because of his trophies of deceased heroes scattered around his fortress, Kang shows he means no harm and that he just wants to help. As such, he opens a warp in which he shows Adam his own past: his birth, his fights withThor, theHigh Evolutionary,Man-Beast,MagusandThanos, his entering theSoul Gemand his return to fight Thanosonce again. Now, at the end of time, Kang shows Adam what lies ahead if the past isn't changed: Infinity's end. Adam sees the vision of all the heroes of Earth dead, while only a future version ofGamorain despair still stands against a menacing figure.\nKang immediately takes Adam back to his citadel, saying he needs to reposition him to a more advantageous place in time. In answer to Adam's objections, he explains that he has already tried 112 times to avert this horrible fate, but to no avail. He's now convinced that Adam can stop this from happening, but he'll need to find theSoul Stoneand keep it safe. Kang will send Adam in the past, so that he can get to 2018 without being located by the wielder of theTime Stone, which Kang asks as compensation for his help after all this has ended. Kang throws Adam into a warp, telling him to find his past self and explain to him everything. After that, a mysterious entity attacks Kang, who claims that its ending will be its being omnipotent but not omniscient. Then, Kang fades away, leaving only his shadow in the citadel.\nAdam finds himself in AncientEgypt. As he's attacked by a group of marauders, he's found by Kang's past version of himself,Rama-Tut. As they walk inside a pyramid, Rama-Tut explains he already knows everything, as he is able to communicate with Kang. Adam is taken to the Celestium, a place where Rama-Tut was able to observe the continuity and understand that a specific spot in the universe, where a single planet revolves around a star, is the location Adam will have to keep safe, to prevent all life from being snuffed out. There he will find Magus, armed with the Soul Stone, and returned from the dead in parallel with Adam as his doppelganger.\nRama-Tut explains that they must be stealthy in approaching 2018, as Kang's death in the future means the entity already possesses the power infinite. Thus, as Adam enters a tomb, Rama-Tut stabs him in the back, and has him locked inside a sarcophagus. His cocooning process will be slowed down so that he will awaken at the right time, in a few millennia."

The leader of the 13, Talonar, says that their spies have been collecting sensitive data about them: the Novas have been rebuilding strongholds all across the galaxy, but their headquarters are positioned within a large asteroid between the Shi'ar and the Terran systems, who they informally call \"The Rock\". Here, the Nova Corps get their fundings from donations and the minings from the asteroid itself. The overall morale of the troops is weak, though, and the leaders are too weak to change the current state of affairs. On top of that, the Raptors' infiltrates are ready to destroy the Corps from the inside.\nMeanwhile, on the Rock, commander Scott Adsit from Planet Earth starts a discourse to his demoralized and Earth-hostile troops. As he can't seem to stop the soldiers' complaints, he turns to the new arrivals, who happen to be the Guardians of the Galaxy: Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket Raccoon, Groot and the latest entry in the team, Scott Lang a.k.a. Ant-Man.\nLater, Adsit breaks the team up so that they can interact with as many corpsmen as possible in order to identify possible infiltrators. Drax and Groot are sent to a forest planet to take care of some problems; Ant-Man and Gamora go check out a distress call; Quill is appointed with finding out if anyone knows the location of the Infinity Stones (that have apparently disappeared when the Multiverse got re-built from scratches afterSecret Wars). As Quill consults his tablet with info about each Nova member, he realizes that Rich Rider is alive. Rocket starts roaming the base, talking to corpsmen and reprimanding two of them who are drinking confiscated wine.\nFocusing on the Gamora/Ant-Man team, they arrive on a seemingly deserted spaceship from which a distress call had arrived. They soon discover that the aliens aboard have been infected by Ultron and have killed most of the sane dwellers. As they fight their way through multiple Ultronized aliens, Ant-Man questions his decision to leave for space adventures, as his closest enemies seem to be following him. Gamora suggests him to go toKnowhereif he really wishes to leave his past behind for good. They find the door the survivors have locked themselves behind not to be infected or killed: Ant-Man shrinks to get behind it and assures them they are now in good hands. When they get to the docking where they left their ship to the cares of their subordinates, they find that said subordinates left without them. At the same time, a horde of Ultronized aliens corner them.\nFeatured Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nTHE INFINITY QUEST Part 1"

She is the sole survivor of theZen-Whoberis, who were exterminated by theUniversal Church of Truth, worshippers of theMagus. Taken byThanosto thepast, she was forged from victim into the killer of the Magus.[17]Under Thanos' care, Gamora was trained as an elite assassin and had her body mechanically improved.[18]Gamora's mission eventually led her to meetAdam Warlock, the Magus' younger self.[19]As a temporal anomaly, Gamora's help was crucial for Warlock and Thanos to defeat the Magus.[20]With the Magus defeated, events in the future changed so that her people were slaughtered by theBadooninstead, and Gamora's memories of those events have been affected by these timeline changes.[16]\nGamora questioned her father's macabre obsession with death and ultimately betrayed him, joining Warlock.[13]Alongside Warlock, she became a regular player in major cosmic adventures, becoming a member of hisInfinity Watchand being a protector of theTime Stone.[21]During theAnnihilation Waveinvasion, Gamora got close with other cosmic protectors, such asNova, whom she got romantically involved with.[22]AfterHalawas conquered by thePhalanxandUltron, Gamora was invited byPeter Quillto be part of a team of protectors to act in a preventive manner against galactic threats, theGuardians of the Galaxy.[4]\nFor years Gamora was seen as a true hero, until the return of theInfinity Stonesmade her follow her father's goals. Adopting a new identity asRequiem, Gamora killed Thanos and started her quest for the Infinity Stones.[23]After collecting the stones by betraying her former friends, she folded the universe into theWarp World, but was eventually defeated.[24]Gamora was ultimately forgiven by her former allies and rejoined the Guardians of the Galaxy to prevent Thanos' resurrection.[25]\nIn the alternate future ofEarth-7528, Gamora was born to the peace-loving alien humanoid race called theZen Whoberis, where she lived with her parents and little brother. When she was 13,[26]the Zen-Whoberi population were wiped out by theUniversal Church of Truth, a zealous religious order seeking to establish a galaxy-wide empire. Agents of the Church, calledGrand Inquisitors, herded the entire population of the planet into a valley called the Plains of Sorrow and exterminated them all for their resistance.[17]The mad TitanThanoswas on the planet seeking to kill the Church's objectives before they could be converted, but he saved Gamora when he saw she could see the embodiment ofDeathlike he could.[12]Thanos brought her through time to a period at least two decades prior to her people's deaths, travelling toEarth-616. Aboard his space station Zero Sanctuary, Thanos introduced Gamora to hisButcher Squadron, whom he tasked with keeping Gamora imprisoned. When she managed to escape, Thanos killed Butcher Squadron memberInfesti Macerafor her bad behaviour, and Gamora knew she would be safe around Thanos.[26]Later, Thanos took Gamora with him to planetSakaarto kill its troops while they remained in a pupal state. The rough expeditions broke Gamora's leg and arm, but Thanos replaced them with metal prosthetics. Thanos' signs of gentleness, coupled with his increasing mental instability as Death refused to show herself to him, caused his Butcher Squadron to mutiny against him and kidnap Gamora.[27]Gamora killed her captor, capturedR'Hosand returned to Thanos, keeping R'Hos's ship as booty and considering herself part of the Butcher Squadron. Later, she overheard them plot to steal Zero Sanctuary from Thanos, so she rushed to tell him, but he remained uninterested and left to take care of theMagus, his enemy.[28]While escaping from the Squadron, Gamora realized Thanos was being baited by the Magus into a confrontation at the end of the Universe, where he'd die. Gamora rushed to his location, where an exasperated Thanos had already defeated Magus and called her unimportant. Angry, Gamora attacked him.[29]Afterward, Thanos realized the vision of Lady Death that caused him to adopt Gamora had merely been Magus, shape-shifting. With pre-prepared timing, Thanos launched Zero Sanctuary as a missile against the Universal Church of Truth's headquarters, destroying both. The blow weakened the Magus' faith-based powers. Considering the Magus beneath him, Thanos dared him to start his church again from scratch and warned him that Gamora would kill him one day. After that, Thanos built a replacement space station for his men calledSanctuary, and promoted the surviving Butcher Squadron members into theCull Obsidian, with Gamora among their rank.[30]\nOne day, after slaughtering a population, Thanos told Gamora that the universe had a natural order where only the strong survived, and it worked through him. However, not even he would live forever.[31]Thanos used advanced technology to endow Gamora with enhanced humanoid abilities.[17]He also subtly altered her perceptions so that she would not recognize the evil of her deeds.[32]Wanting Gamora to be a killing machine with a sound and rational mind, Thanos gave her as normal a childhood as he could muster, assigning her a birthday (the anniversary of the Zen-Whoberi genocide)[33]and celebrating holidays, including the pre-Christian Yule with shades of modern Earth's Christmas thrown into the mix. On her first Yule, Thanos gifted Gamora a doll. Later, while Thanos worked in his lab, Sanctuary was infiltrated byXtoral Laxtan, a victim of Thanos seeking revenge. When he was about to shoot Thanos' turned back, Gamora threw her doll at Xtoral, making him miss his shot and alerting Thanos. After Thanos killed Xtoral, he offered to replace the scorched doll, but Gamora said she would repair \"Dolly\" herself. After that, Thanos and Gamora visited a lagoon.[34]\nLater, Thanos sent Gamora to an alien planet with the task of killing one person. However, Gamora couldn't bring herself to do it and brought an already dead corpse to Sanctuary, hoping to trick Thanos. Seeing through her deception, Thanos destroyed the entire planet as punishment.[35]\nWhen Gamora was 15, she went on a trip with Thanos. Though explicitly against Thanos orders and warning, out of curiosity she decided to venture planetside. In turn she fell into an ambush set up by a group of thugs. The attackers used their numbers advantage and were able to defeat her in spite of her great skill. She was severely injured in the fight and gang raped. Near death, Thanos arrived and quickly dispatched the assailants. After returning to Sanctuary, Thanos restored and augmented Gamora. This was achieved via bionic implants and replacement parts of Thanos' own design. These physical and power upgrades made her an equal toAdam Warlock's own physical abilities. She also received specialized training and abilities including resistance to reality distortion as well as an accelerated healing factor, but she lost the ability to shed tears for many years.[18]\nAfter this, Thanos adopted another young woman,Nebula, who became Gamora's sister, with the two always having a high degree of tension between each other.[33]\nWhen Gamora was 22, she met a youngRocket Raccoon, but the two were captured byBadoonsand needed to be rescued by theSupernovasJesse Alexander,Titus, andMister Z'zz.[36]\nThanos planned to send Gamora to assassinate his enemy, the Magus. She practiced for this assignment by killing the Church'sGrand Inquisitors.[19]Thanos hoped that the presence of a non-contemporary element such as Gamora inserted into the Magus's present would disrupt his opponent's plans and eliminate the divergence of events that created the Magus from this timeline.[17]Gamora's presence was detected by the Magus, who prevented her from getting close enough to assassinate him.[11]Gamora did, however, assist Adam Warlock in his final battle against Magus.[37]\nWhen Magus was defeated, events in the future changed so that her people were slaughtered by theBadooninstead, and Gamora's memories have been affected by these timeline changes.[16]Gamora returned to her master Thanos, but after a couple of weeks atSanctuary, Thanos' base of operations at the time, Gamora expressed her boredom to Thanos. Thanos then told her to find Warlock and become his unofficial bodyguard. While locating Warlock, she was attacked byDrax the Destroyer, a being whose sole purpose in life is to kill Thanos.[38]She escaped Drax, and returned to Thanos. On her 31st birthday, eighteen years to the day Thanos found her, he presented Gamora a gift. The entire Badoon Royal Line had gathered onMoordto welcome the ascension of a new Monarch, allowing Gamora to slaughter them all, thus fulfilling her revenge. However, on his deathbed the previous Monarch confessed that he had an illegitimate daughter, now the only heir to the throne, and a captured member of the Council made that information know to Thanos' daughters. Gamora went to finish her mission toUbliex, a planet days away from falling into ablack hole, with hope of escape and wishing only to complete her quest of revenge before her own demise.[33]\nGamora eventually foundL'Wit, but before she was able to kill her she also came across theVestigials, a group ofZen-Whoberissexiled to Ubliex for their crimes who were now the only living remains of her people. As the planet was hours apart from falling beyond the event horizon, the Vestigials found the only way off the planet and offered Gamora a seat on their ship.[39]However, in her pursuit of L'Wit Gamora had realized that her quest for revenge had consumed her, leaving her no other meaning life. When the leader of the Vestigials left for dead to save his own skin, Gamora saw them as being no better than Thanos and decided to abandon her only ties to the past, taking L'Wit and a bunch of other refugees with her instead. They were able to escape being swallowed by the black hole but were attacked byNebulaand, knowing that her sister was after her only, Gamora let the survivors escape to safety while Nebula took her back to Thanos.[40]\nUpon returning, Gamora found out Thanos planned to destroy the universe as a sacrifice toDeath. Horrified, she tried to slay Thanos with a dagger, but Thanos slew her instead.Adam Warlockfound Gamora with one last spark of life remaining in her body and used hisSoul Gemto absorb her consciousness.[13]\nGamora's spirit remained in the Soul Gem until theInfinity Gauntlet crisis, when in a plan to stop the Mad Titan from destroying the universe, Warlock projected his, Gamora's and Pip's souls into three deceased bodies. His powers reshaped their shattered bodies into new, more powerful versions of their old bodies.[41]She joined Warlock in his plan to stop Thanos, but she herself was not present for most of the fighting. In the end, when Warlock had seized possession of the Infinity Gauntlet for himself, Gamora remained at his side for whatever would come next, although she was a bit against the idea of leaving Thanos free.[42]\nA couple of months later, Warlock was convinced by theLiving Tribunalthat he was unworthy of wielding the power of all Infinity Gems, so he decided to divide the gems among those he trusts. Gamora was entrusted with the supposed defunctTime Gem, and was made a member of theInfinity Watch.[43]The team, led by Adam Warlock and consisting of Drax, Pip andMoondragon, settled inMonster Island, the sovereign nation ruled by theMole Man.[44]Not long after that, the Watch was forced to team up with Thanos after the reappearance of an old foe of theirs, the Magus. However, this Magus was the result of Warlock expelling both the bad and the good from his body in order to truly become a logical being. She and Thanos appeared to have reconciled their relationship and even went a round of friendly sparring while on their mission to defeat the Magus. The Watch, Thanos, and Earth's heroes managed to defeat the Magus, and he was banished to Soul World.[45]\nAt times, Gamora would inadvertently tap into the power of the Time Gem and get a good glimpse of the future. One of her visions was of a man standing over, what appeared to be, a deceased Adam Warlock. This frightened her, even more so when Warlock was put into a coma after the battle with the Magus.[46]While the Watch, struggled to come together as a team, Gamora stayed by Warlock's bedside and protected the island from foreign invaders. However, one day, a man by the name ofMaxamwashed up on their shore, and she immediately recognized him as the man from her vision. This suspicious man had no idea who he was nor where he was, but even so, Gamora voted for the Watch to not help him, but Warlock (who had recently woken up from his coma) said they'd help him for the time being.[47]\nYet another universal threat emerged whenAdam Warlock's good sidesought to eradicate the universe of all sin by simply eradicating the universe itself. However, Gamora (and many of Earth's heroes, including fellow Infinity Watch member Moondragon) was manipulated into joining the Goddess' crusade. A war broke out between those manipulated and those non-manipulated with both side suffering heavy casualties. Those manipulated were broke out of trance when Warlock and Thanos defeated the Goddess and banished her to soul world.[48]The team returned back to Monster Island where they could focus on helping Maxam, to Gamora's displeasure. It was a much-needed break, but then Warlock called the Watch to help theSilver Surferdefeat the mentally unstableThor. The Watch went against Adam's instructions and attacked Thor without him present, which resulted in Thor taking the Power Gem from Drax. After this catastrophic mistake, Warlock and Silver Surfer were forced to enlist the help ofDoctor Strangeto take them and the rest of the Watch toAsgard. They were not met gladly there, for they had to fight their way through Trolls and Asgardians warriors (and even had to get help from Thanos)) to getOdinto finally help Thor. In the end, Thor was cured and Asgard was indebted to the Watch.[49]\nHer true feelings for Adam Warlock began to show further when Maya came to the island and she and Adam fell in love because ofCount Abyss' love potion. She believed the best answer was to simply kill Maya. Eventually she accepted it for what it was and went to help rescue her from Abyss in his dimension. The Watch were successful in rescuing Maya, but she ended up marrying someone else.[50]\nThings would quickly get out of hand for Gamora again. This time due toMaxammaking what he thought was a harmless tease about Gamora's feelings towards Adam and referring to it as puppy love. Due to her still being unable to express herself to Adam and her unease and concerns about Maxam, due to the visions from her gem, Gamora attacked Maxam. The two had fought before but this time Gamora was aware of her opponent. The fight favored Gamora to triumph until it was broken up when Moondragon, whom was currently in a coma, used Drax and his power gem to communicate. Adam was displeased with Gamora's actions and told her so. This in turn angered and caused Gamora to verbally lash out. For it was not her mistrust of Maxam directly concerning Adams own well-being. Unable to accept Adam siding with Maxam over her, she quit the team and threw her gem at Adam when he asked for it back. Which Warlock in turn gave to Maxam. She then had Pip teleport her away from Monster Island andEarth. She was tracked down by Thanos, who sought out the Time Gem in order to erase his troubled history. However, just as Gamora was going to make a decision to help him or not, all the Infinity Gems of the Watch, and Thanos' Reality gem, disappeared.[51]\nGamora later separated herself from Thanos and went back to being an assassin/lone wolf for a couple of years. She was walking around the space port Baligiest, when she heard that Thanos was there and working with the Nihilist Sect, a religious group he founded, again. She saw him, but he looked different. She described his new look as \"a bad parody of Iron Man,\" but before she could question it, Thanos spotted her and attacked her. She barely escaped the space port and flew to Thanos' old hideout back when he was retired to find some answers. The hideout was trashed and a Skrull research vessel was right outside. There, she found the real Thanos, who was injured, and he showed her the answers to her questions. Thanos created clones of himself many years ago, but never activated them. They remained dormant until a secret enemy of his activated five of them recently, and those five clones all had fixation on destroying the universe and the programming \"Adam Warlock is the key to oblivion\". Just then, the Thanos clone she recently encountered tracked her to her location, so she and Thanos had to destroy it. After they did that, Thanos began to spy on the other \"Thanosi\", he did, and their plan was revealed. Gamora was later sent to aidSpider-ManandCaptain Marvelin protectingAtleza, a human girl who was destined to become an anchor of their reality. They, with the aid of Moondragon, protected the little girl until Adam Warlock, Pip the Troll and Thanos arrived. They arrived to defeat the Omega Thanosi, who was combination of Thanos and Galactus. After they won the battle, Gamora and Adam Warlock entered a loving relationship and decided to depart into another dimension to protect and raise Atleza.[52]\nGamora and Adam would return sometimes, if their aid in others' adventures was called upon. Such was the case when they attempted to stop the tyrannical rule of theChampion of the Universeon the planetSkardon. After Adam's defeat,She-Hulkwas cosmically summoned to fight the Champion, and she too was defeated. However, she was allowed a rematch. In the meantime, Gamora trained Jen intensively and got her strength to unprecedented levels. In addition to this, She-Hulk got the Champion to fight her with hisPower Stone, making the task of defeating the Champion and freeing theSkardsrelatively easy.[53]\nWhen Atleza outgrew the need for their tutelage, Gamora and Adam joined Pip to travel the universe. Afterward, the trio encountered unidentified cosmic entities who humbled, abused and discarded Gamora, who left her friends to seek refuge from her mistreatment alone. Gamora was among the adventurers subconsciously drawn to the Kree planetGodthab Omegaby the would-be world-shaperGlorian. Whether due to Glorian's influence or not, Gamora launched a reign of terror against Godthab, conquering territories and killing hundreds as if imitating the slaughter that awaited her own people in the future; she gathered several other alien women as her lieutenants, Gamora'sGraces, and via their alien science or magic, augmented her powers significantly. In the early days of theAnnihilation War, Gamora and herGracesran into conflict withRonan the Accuser, whom Gamora faced in single combat, even brandishingGodslayer.[54]Much later, Gamora began sleeping withNovaand joined theUnited Front[22], using her skills to launch quick counter-attacks against theAnnihilation Wave.[55]Near the end of the war, Nova put Gamora in charge of interrogating several Kree collaborators, but Gamora felt it would be quicker to just kill them. This act ended their relationship.[56]\nDuring thePhalanx's invasion of theKreehomeworld ofHalafollowing the Annihilation War, Gamora was assimilated as a \"select\" of the hive mind. They dispatched her to apprehend Nova after he fled the planet.[9]The Phalanx then attacked, slaughtering everyone. Ko-rel attempted to draw them away, leaving only Select Gamora to infect Rider with the transmode virus, accelerating his recovery.[57]On planetoid Nil-Rat, Rider and Gamora subdued Drax the Destroyer and brought him in for selection. Once they deposited him, Rider confided in Gamora that he feared that he'd lose himself in the Phalanx collective. Gamora told him that the Phalanx had evolved and valued individuality. Ko-rel refused to be a murderer for her son's sake. However, she was stabbed in the back by Gamora.[58]The Selects Gamora and Drax were sent after Nova with the task to kill him.[59]At theKnowherestation Gamora and Drax found Nova.[60]\nRider and Gamora lay unconscious beside each other. Then, an ominous noise woke them. When they come to, they realized whom they were face-to-face with and reacted; Gamora moved quickly to kill him; Rider tried to ask her what the last thing was she remembered besides trying to kill him, while putting a phased pulse ready to clear off her head from her neck. She relented and expressed that all she could recall was that she and Drax caught up to him. Rider asked Worldmind as to where they were; the Xandarian gestalt was unable to present any answer, mostly due to their diminished power levels. All around them was what looked like a graveyard of ships. Also, their passport bracelets were inactive, and Gamora's precognitive sense was dulled. Worldmind then detected another life form ahead, which he identified as a pachyceph voidnaut, stranded and lost from his herd. Rider attempted to assist him, but bright creatures appeared out of nowhere and started mauling on the voidnaut. Rider grabbed Gamora and fled from the creatures. Once they were far away, Rider took a moment to rest, for every time he lost concentration, the virus took a firmer hold. Gamora encouraged him to surrender to the transmode virus so they could be together again. He slapped her away, stating that he would fight it with every ounce of his being.\nWhen the creatures attacked again, Worldmind reminded Rider that he couldn't fight them at a fraction of his own power and advised him to withdraw and abandon Gamora. However, Rider refused to do the latter and carried her away from the creatures. They then headed through a portal that landed them somewhere else. Rider started coughing up the virus; Gamora urged him to give in to it or else it would kill him, which he refused. Frustrated at his stubbornness, she made one last plea for him to be with her again. Worldmind then formulated a hypothesis; they were trapped inside a Vore, a creature that prowled in the spaces between dimensions. They were currently in the birthing canal, where its young were about to be born. Rider formed a shield around himself and Gamora, as they were thrown out of the Vore. Once outside, Gamora attempted to stab him in the back, only for him to strike first, crushing her leg; he didn't trust her for a second. He then dumped her on top of Drax, who was furiously firing at the Vore, before resuming transit to Kvch, hoping to find a cure to the virus before it regained control or killed him in the next two hours.[56]Drax and Gamora followed Nova's trail. However, the transmode virus within them reacted to the planet, merging them with the very metal of the planet to form a Babel Spire, summoning a Technarchy Siredam.[61]\nA massive siredam was drawn to the signal made from the Babel Spire Drax and Gamora were trapped in, intending to find Tyro and kill him. After the siredam had ripped him apart before engulfing him, its techno-organic code was being rewritten from the inside and Tyro took control of the siredam, bringing Warlock back to life and curing Drax and Gamora of the virus. Drax was grateful for being free, but Gamora was scared, feeling that she was worthless without the transmode virus. Nova comforted her, assuring her that he had found a cure to save the Kree.[6]\nHaving no purpose and wanting to do things for the greater good, Gamora joined the team of heroes known as theGuardians of the Galaxy.[4]At first she was not trusted because of her past, but after risking her life to save the others, she was seen in a different light. While trying to close a fissure located inside a Dyson Sphere, the team decided to stop threats to them by turning off the shield that protected them from the star's immense heat.[62]They planned to teleport out but were unable to do so. Gamora braved the intense heat in order to turn the shields back on, charring her entire body from head to toe.[63]\nIt took some time for Gamora to heal from this. After theSkrullswere found onKnowhere, the team's base, accusations ran high, especially towards Gamora.[64]After they found the Skrulls, it was revealed to all thatStar-LordhadMantismildly brainwash them into joining the team.[65]Disgusted, Gamora quit the team and headed off with Adam Warlock.[66]After a short run in with the Universal Church of Truth,[67]Gamora and Adam returned to the Guardians in order to help them continue to save the universe.[68]\nWhen theInhumanKingBlack Boltunleashed theTerrigen Bomb, which created a massive rip in space-time known as the Fault,[69]Warlock was able to stop the tear from expanding, but in doing so he had to overlap the timestream, causing himself to turn into the Magus.[70]Gamora, along with many other Guardians, was killed by the Magus before finally being stopped by Star-Lord and aCosmic Cube.[71]But this was a trick and the Magus only faked her death, taking Gamora's soul and remaking her with the Church of Truth's belief energy. As a captive of the Magus, she was subject to the torture of their interrogators in an effort to convert her to the Church's beliefs. For a time, it was believed this had worked but when the other team members broke free of their captors, she fought alongside them.[5]\nGamora along with the other Guardians teamed up withTony Starkto stop aBadooninvasion of Earth (specifically London) only to be captured by theSpartax Empireforces sent byJ'sondue to a newly created off-limit rule for Earth.[72]While being held captive aboard a Spartax ship,Grootmanaged to rescue the Guardians along with Tony Stark from captivity and the group was able to take over the entire Spartax ship.[1]\nAngela and Gamora against the Badoon\nWhile the Guardians celebrated their freedom within a bar, Tony Stark hooked up with Gamora. After the two had sex Gamora decided to return to the bar. On her way the warrior was attacked and injured by bounty hunter Maxilin the Accuser, just as she was about to be executed the bounty hunter was shot byRocket Raccoon. After her brush from death the Guardians hid from Spartax forces within the Seedy Side of the Andromeda Galaxy. Aboard the Guardian's ship Gamora walked into an awkward encounter with Tony in which she simply ignored him. The group detected an object moving towards Earth and proceeded to intercept it. The object turned out to be the newly arrivedAngelawho was transported fromHevendue to the time-space continuum fracture.[73]Gamora proceeded to battle the deadly angel on the dark side of the Moon. After barely defeating the overpowering angel and encountering theThe Watcher, the Guardians captured Angela. Angela recollected her story of struggle into the 616 universe and was set free under Star-Lord's command.[74]Gamora, along with the Guardians, helped rescueAbigail Brandduring Thanos' invasion of Earth. Gamora later fought alongside Angela against the Badoon slave traders and the two became close friends.[75]\nLater, Gamora forced Peter to reveal how he, Drax and Thanos had returned from the Cancerverse. In his tale, Peter revealed Nova had turned himself into a gate so the rest could escape, and in his final words, he confessed he had been in love with Gamora and had dreams of convincing her to settle down.[76]Hearing this made Gamora fall in love with an idealized version of Nova.[77]\nAfter retrieving theBlack Vortexfrom his father,Mister Knife,Star-LordandKitty Prydegathered both the Guardians of the Galaxy and the X-Men atSpartaxto decide what to do with such powerful item. The heroes were tracked down by Mister Knife's cosmically-empoweredSlaughter Lordsand overpowered.[78]During the battle, Gamora submitted to the power of the Black Vortex and had her cosmic potential unleashed, turning the tide of the battle, and allowing the Guardians and the X-Men escape from the Slaughter Lords to Spartax's moon and decide whether to submit to the Black Vortex or not. After Beast of the X-Men submitted to the Black Vortex, attaining cosmic powers, and X-23 attempted to destroy it, Gamora used the Black Vortex to show both teams, along with Sam Alexander, what they stood to gain by submitting to its power.[79]\nBeast and Angel submitted to the Black Vortex and accompanied Gamora in a journey to attempt to empower the entire universe.[80]However, at the first planet they stopped they were assaulted by theAccuser Corps, who took the Vortex from them. In retaliation, they attackedHala.[81]A cosmically-empowered Ronan managed to force them to flee to a distant planet.[82]J'son would take advantage of Hala's condition following Gamora, Beast and Angel's attack, and used all of his firepower to finish off the entire planet.\nMagik and Rocket Raccoon later tracked them down and talked sense into them, so they could help them fight J'son and his Slaughter Lords.[83]After J'son recovered the Vortex and used its power onThaneto encase the entirety of Spartax in an amber construct,[84]the heroes got the Vortex back and used it on X-ManKitty Prydeso she could use her now-enhanced phasing powers to phase Spartax through the amber construct and save the planet. Before getting rid of the Vortex, some of the cosmically empowered heroes decided to remove their cosmic powers, Gamora wasn't one of them.[85]\nGamora empowered by the Black Vortex\nGamora left the Guardians of the Galaxy after her presence onSpartaxcaught the attention ofKindun, a vengeful victim of Thanos and Gamora's attacks many decades ago, thinking herself to be a threat to the safety of her teammates. The conflict also helped Gamora realize the kind of power she held and decided to use it to hunt down Thanos once and for all.[86]\nThe following months, Gamora worn out the enhancements of the Black Vortex, having exerted them on her arduous search for Thanos,[87]which bore no results as Thanos was temporarily existing outside the universe.[88]This almost cost Gamora her life when she came into conflict againstHala, a Kree on a quest for revenge due to the destruction of her planetary namesake. Gamora tried to stop her from reachingSpartax, targeting Peter Quill for being J'son son, but failed.[89]Following Hala's defeat at the hands of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Gamora rejoined the team.[90]\nTogether with the rest of her teammates, Gamora was summoned toEarthby their friendCaptain Marvelto assist her during thesecond superhuman civil war.[91]After waging war at theTriskelionagainst the faction of heroes led by Iron Man that opposed Captain Marvel,[92]Gamora turned on her allies when she found out not only that Thanos was being held on Earth, but also that Captain Marvel had kept that piece of information from her on purpose. Following a brawl with Captain Marvel, Gamora decided to cut her ties with the Guardians of the Galaxy when she learned that Star-Lord had been aware of Thanos' status too.[93]While grounded on Earth, Gamora ran into Nova, who had returned from the Cancerverse. Gamora felt conflicting emotions, as he had avoided meeting her for a while after returning, he disapproved of her plans to kill Thanos,[94]and she had fallen in love with Nova's wishes to settle down, but seeing he was back and couldn't stop being in action broke down her fantasy and her infatuation.[77]\nGamora attempted to break into the Triskelion once again but was stopped by the combined forces of theUltimatesandAlpha Flight. Captain Marvel updated her on Thanos' status, claiming that he was no longer on Earth, and gave her an ultimatum, to be escorted out of Earth by theShi'aror face Earth's justice system. While being delivered to theImperial Guard, Gamora escaped and made her way back to the Triskelion and into Thanos' cell, which she discovered was completely empty. Having forced Captain Marvel's hand, Gamora was locked inside that very same cell that held her father.[95]When Thanos returned to Earth not long afterwards, Gamora was freed to join the brawl against the Mad Titan. She stood in front of him when he laid defeated and decided to spare his life after seeing him humbled.[96]\nAfter experiencing reoccurring dreams concerning encounters with an older version of herself, Gamora came to the realization that a portion of her soul remained trapped inside the Soul World. Determined to set it free, Gamora set out to find the Soul Gem.[97]To this end, she locatedGrandmasterand made a deal with him. To perform missions for him with the Guardians of the Galaxy in exchange for information, hoping to find about the Soul Gem this way.[98]When carrying a heist on theCollector's collection, Tivan agreed to help Gamora in her mission. He made a deal with Gamora, offering his assistance in stealing the Soul Gem if it turned out the Grandmaster possessed, in exchange for the Infinity Gem Gamora bluffed about possessing.[99]\nWhen the Collector interrupted the Guardians' rendezvous with their client, the Grandmaster revealed he had challenged his brother just to test him. The Collector and the Grandmaster learned that some of their fellow Elders were mysteriously altered or gone and determined they could be linked to the disappearance of the Infinity Stones. Since helping the Grandmaster and the Collector gather the stones aligned with her plans, Gamora convinced her teammates to embark on a quest to find them.[100]After helping theNova Corpsdefend thePower Stonewhich had manifested in the planetXitaung,[101]the Guardians took off with it toOblitus. They were approached by Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror, who had joined forces to find theTime Stoneand already had theSoul Gemin their possession. Gamora attempted to force Warlock to hand over the Soul Gem, and a fight broke out. During the battle, Drax managed to hold it, but was exposed to the corruption of Soulworld. He struck Gamora to prevent her from opening the gem and departed with Warlock and Kang. In addition to Drax's betrayal, the other Guardians refused to follow Gamora into pursuing Kang. Outraged by her teammates' behavior, Gamora left them to obtain the Soul Gem on her own.[102]\nGamora as Requiem\nIn order to help her quest, Gamora kidnapped a master forger fromNidavellirand forced him to make her an armor, killing him afterwards.[103]She later agreed a parley with Star-Lord in order to steal the Power Stone from him, by switching it with a fake without him noticing, and encrusted the hilt of herInfinity Bladewith it.[3]Sporting her masked armor and the encrusted sword, Gamora attacked Thanos before he could set out to gather the Infinity Stones to prevent his interference. After being felled, Thanos remarked that Gamora was going to conduct his requiem. Despite brushing off her father's comment and killing him,[23]Gamora decided to adopt that word as her new alias and became known as Requiem.[3]After murdering Thanos, Gamora started being plagued by apparitions of him.[31]\nRequiem subsequently interrupted a conclave of the new Infinity Watch to steal the Infinity Stones, and her true identity was quickly revealed to her former allies. Star-Lord was surprised by Gamora's uncharacteristic behavior, and she tried to kill him,[3]he was only saved by the intervention ofDoctor Strangeusing the Time Stone. As the conflict continued, Gamora managed to get her hands on theReality Stone, and quickly claimed the remaining Stones from their owners. Encouraged by Thanos' apparition, Gamora hesitantly opened a portal to the Soul Gem and reunited with the fragment of herself, becoming whole again. She then set out to rebalance the Soul Gem.[31]\nTo prevent opposition from her quest and to feed the beingDevondra, who was responsible for the Soul Gem's hungering for souls, Gamora used the Infinity Stones to fold the universe in half and merge the two halves together before sending the new universe into a pocket dimension calledWarp Worldinside the Soul Gem. Gamora planned to create a reality once Devondra devoured all the souls and ensure that suffering no longer existed in this new universe. She also sealedLokiinto the Soul Gem when he asked to be her counsel. Gamora and Loki's companionFlowathen traveled to theGod Quarryso Gamora could investigate what laid beneath it as she couldn't see past it.[104]\nGamora in possession of the Infinity Gems\nEven with the Infinity Stones, Gamora was unable to breach the barrier at the bottom of the God Quarry.[105]After fendingalternate realityversions ofCaptain MarvelandMoondragon, Gamora was confronted by Loki and his newly assembledCosmic Avengerswho had managed to escape the Soul Gem. Wielding copies of the Infinity Stones Gamora unintentionally created when she created Warp World, the Cosmic Avengers easily subdued Gamora and took the Infinity Stones from her. However, Loki used his sorcery to take control of Gamora's Infinity Stones and used them to send her and the alternate reality Phyla-Vell and Moondragon to Warp World before transporting himself to the unknown realm that existed beneath the God Quarry.[106]\nWhile in Warp World, Gamora was clobbered bySoldier Supremeand nearly consumed by Devondra but was rescued byPeet, the fusion of Star-Lord and Groot. The Cosmic Avengers eventually returned with the Infinity Stones after Loki relinquished them. With Adam Warlock's help, the Cosmic Avengers restored the universe while also allowing Warp World to remain in existence. They then fled Soul World using the Soul Gem with Gamora, Star-Lord, Groot, Rocket Raccoon, Moondragon, and Phyla-Vell, but Drax had to stay behind to keep the portal opened. They arrived on Earth and crash-landed in Egypt. Phyla-Vell and Moondragon wanted to punish Gamora for destroying their universe, even though that was the work of a different Gamora. Adam Warlock decided to send Gamora to a random location using the Infinity Stones in order to redeem herself. Gamora ended up on an unknown planet with a resurrected Magus.[107]\nGamora and Magus obtained the spaceship Lachesis, and, upon learning Rocket Raccoon was deadly ill and withering away inHalfworld, Gamora decided to take them there to protect the raccoon until his death and bury him afterward.[108]On the way, Gamora told Magus about her childhood and recorded the tale. After crash-landing in Halfworld, Gamora finished telling her story. Later, she told Magus to get on Lachesis and fly away to wherever he wanted, but left some coordinates in the ship to a planet that had been damaged by the Magus, if he wanted to go there. Gamora believed those people could help the kid. She was sorry for not being able to raise Magus, but he assured her she was saving him. Gamora continued seeing Thanos' ghost at this stage, but seemingly stopped afterward.[109]While looking after Rocket, she and the raccoon sometimes got together for drinks, and she told him about Magus' location in one of these occassions.[110]Some time later, Gamora was visited by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who warned her theDark Guardiansplanned to kill her after it was learned from Thanos' will that he planned to resurrect himself by uploading his consciousness into an unrevealed being. Nova arrived shortly after to warn Gamora of the same thing, but he was followed by the Dark Guardians, who took Gamora prisoner.[111]\nThe Dark Guardians took Gamora toLilandra IV, the flagship destroyer of theShi'arroyal armada. There, Gamora learned their leader was her uncle,Starfox. As the Dark Guardians were about to kill Gamora, all of them were knocked out by the Asgardian death goddessHelaand theBlack Order, who allowed Thanos to resurrect in Starfox. When the Guardians arrived, Gamora informed Starfox had gone to Knowhere to try to put his mind in Thanos' body.[112]Gamora, the Guardians and the remaining Dark Guardians attacked Knowhere, where Gamora stabbed Starfox with a sword in order to stop his mind transfer. This caused Thanos to be brought back with a broken mind. Grieving, Hela shot a black hole cannon, but it accidentally hit Thanos and swallowed up Knowhere. The Guardians and Dark Guardians managed to escape, and Peter told Gamora he loved her.[25]Gamora wasted no time in responding Peter's feelings, and the two slept together. Gamora gave her heart to Peter because Nova had given lip-service to settling down and finding a home away from combat, but he didn't have it in him to stop, whereas Peterwashome for Gamora.[77]Later, the Guardians faced a newUniversal Church of Truth, and the crisis forced Rocket Raccoon to return to the fold. In the aftermath, the raccoon agreed to undergo treatment to heal his body in Halfworld while the Guardians took a vacation while veiling for his recovery.[113]\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy had settled down in Halfworld when Nova approached them for their assistance in stopping the conquering rampage of theOlympians, who had been reborn as bloodthirsty rogue gods. Gamora was one of the Guardians who turned away out of concern for the safety of each other, saying they were a family now.[114]Some of the members, including Star-Lord, snuck away to assist Nova and were successful in their mission of trapping the Dark Olympians in an alternate dimension at the apparent cost of Quill's life.[115]As a result, Gamora broke off the team with the other Guardians who had stayed behind and formed theirown teamof Guardians of the Galaxy to return to their mercenary ways.[116]During their first mission, the mercenary Guardians came at odds with their former teammates, but eventually reached a truce.[77]\nStar-Lord returned from the other-dimensional world ofMorinus, where he had spent a hundred of years of his life, albeit unageing, to herald the escape of the Dark Olympians from their imprisonment.[117]The two Guardians teams came together for the final confrontation against the Dark Olympians which saw their defeat.[118]In the aftermath, the Guardians of the Galaxy were sanctioned by theGalactic Councilas protectors of the cosmos in light of the increasing uncertainty of the galactic landscape, providing them with headquarters in the space stationProscenium.[119]Despite being reunited with Gamora, Peter became distant toward her due to the life he had lived in Morinus, where he had joined a new relationship and even fathered a son.[120]\nArtificially Enhanced Physiology:Gamora was enhanced to levels of superhuman strength, durability, endurance and reflexes, and healing factor.[18]Gamora received treatments from Thanos that enhanced her physiology. While engaging theU.S. Military, it was mentioned that the armed forces were under the impression that she was no stronger than Spider-Man. However, her skill combined with her strength made them estimate her to be close to as dangerous as Iron Man but she's even stronger now due to later enhancements.[124]She was stated to have a \"Village/City\" threat level by theNova Corps, but that she had a potential Universal one when in possession of theTime Gem.[125]\n\nBlack Vortex Empowerment:After exposure to the power of theBlack VortexGamora's cosmic potential was unleashed, vastly improving on all of her previous abilities and bestowing additional ones.[79]\nCosmic Augmentation:While leader of theGracesGamora underwent a process that granted her abilities almost on par with those ofRonan the Accuser. She apparently lost these powers after leavingGodthab Omega.[32]\nVs.Ronan the Accuser\nMost Dangerous Woman in the Universe:Gamora is said to be the most dangerous female assassin in the Milky Way galaxy. She is a highly accomplished athlete trained in gymnastics, hand-to-hand combat, the uses of the known weaponry of the galaxy, and stealth techniques.[16]\nGamora uses a number of weapons. In the past she wielded theGodslayer.[131][16]and a special dagger designed to kill the Magus.[11]\nInfinity Blade:As Requiem, she commissioned a sword that was made alongside the armor.[102]The sword was later destroyed.[106]"

The leader of the 13, Talonar, says that their spies have been collecting sensitive data about them: the Novas have been rebuilding strongholds all across the galaxy, but their headquarters are positioned within a large asteroid between the Shi'ar and the Terran systems, who they informally call \"The Rock\". Here, the Nova Corps get their fundings from donations and the minings from the asteroid itself. The overall morale of the troops is weak, though, and the leaders are too weak to change the current state of affairs. On top of that, the Raptors' infiltrates are ready to destroy the Corps from the inside.\nMeanwhile, on the Rock, commander Scott Adsit from Planet Earth starts a discourse to his demoralized and Earth-hostile troops. As he can't seem to stop the soldiers' complaints, he turns to the new arrivals, who happen to be the Guardians of the Galaxy: Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket Raccoon, Groot and the latest entry in the team, Scott Lang a.k.a. Ant-Man.\nLater, Adsit breaks the team up so that they can interact with as many corpsmen as possible in order to identify possible infiltrators. Drax and Groot are sent to a forest planet to take care of some problems; Ant-Man and Gamora go check out a distress call; Quill is appointed with finding out if anyone knows the location of the Infinity Stones (that have apparently disappeared when the Multiverse got re-built from scratches afterSecret Wars). As Quill consults his tablet with info about each Nova member, he realizes that Rich Rider is alive. Rocket starts roaming the base, talking to corpsmen and reprimanding two of them who are drinking confiscated wine.\nFocusing on the Gamora/Ant-Man team, they arrive on a seemingly deserted spaceship from which a distress call had arrived. They soon discover that the aliens aboard have been infected by Ultron and have killed most of the sane dwellers. As they fight their way through multiple Ultronized aliens, Ant-Man questions his decision to leave for space adventures, as his closest enemies seem to be following him. Gamora suggests him to go toKnowhereif he really wishes to leave his past behind for good. They find the door the survivors have locked themselves behind not to be infected or killed: Ant-Man shrinks to get behind it and assures them they are now in good hands. When they get to the docking where they left their ship to the cares of their subordinates, they find that said subordinates left without them. At the same time, a horde of Ultronized aliens corner them.\nFeatured Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nTHE INFINITY QUEST Part 1"

He decided to prevent this from happening and that he would dedicate his life to collecting artifacts and living beings throughout the universe to place them out of danger. Then, after the destruction of the universe, he could re-populate it and bequeath the knowledge and cultures from past. He built agreat spaceshipand began his work with the help ofGatherers, stopping on every world to collect a sample of its greatest achievements, as well as living representatives of each of their lifeforms.\nIn a matter of years, the ship was full and he had to stop in order to collect expanded facilities for his \"permanent collection\". Using robo-mechanics bought on planetCron, the Collector transferred his collection. Every time his ship's hold became full, the Collector would return to his museum-worlds to place the new samples. He has currently filled up ten \"museum-worlds\" with artifacts from one-hundred-thousand planets. With the passing of eons, his monomania became more obsessive, until he forgot the original reason for his collection.[2]\nThe Collector's Fortress\nThe Collector eventually developed a traveling menagerie. This allowed him to showcase his new acquisitions, raise funds, and add more specimens to his collection. TheGuardians of the Galaxywere temporarily imprisoned at this facility while it was stopped nearPluto.[3]\nThe Collector also has zoos of alien beasts which he can release to attack his adversaries.\nMuseum onKnowhere\nThe Collectorwith his collection\nCarinaintroducingThe Collectorand his Museum\nThe Collectorhad a Museum onKnowhere. He housed the galaxy's largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manner. Tivan's collection comprised multiple sentient creatures including aDark Elf, aChitauriwarrior, aFrost Giant, aDuckworldian, aKrylorian, a Rainer, and numerous others. Tivan also possessed rare and unique pieces such as an Evolutionary Cocoon, theAether,Cosmothe Cosmonaut dog, and various skeletal and mummified remains of species.[12][13]\nThe Museum was damaged when Carina, in an act of defiance, laid her hand on theInfinity Stonewithinthe Orbin an attempt to try and harness it's power. The ensuing explosion appears to have release most (if not all) of the Collector's specimens.[13]\nThe Museum was destroyed whenThanoscame for the Aether, which was subsequently materialized into theReality Stone. Expecting the Guardians of the Galaxy, namely Gamora, to come to stop him, Thanos used the Stone's power to create an illusion in which he was confronting the Collector. After Gamora killed his fake, Thanos lifted the illusion, disappearing the illusionary Collector as well. The fate of the real Collector is unknown.[14]\n\nCosmic Conservatory\nTheCosmic Conservatorywas a school run bythe Collector.Gamoracompared the school to a museum or a prison than a school, since Collector collected young powerful beings around the cosmos himself and held them at the Conservatory as part of his collection. AfterThanoshad taken over the campus,Rocket RaccoonandIron Mandestroyed the school.[15]\n\nA starship docked within Knowhere containing theCollector's private collection, and if endangered it would take off. The Collection was comprised ofNova's helmet, theUltimate Nullifier,Heimdall'sHofund,Superhuman Registration Act,Yondu'sYaka Arrow,Stan Lee's Glasses, aBrood Queen,Throgand hisFrogjolnir,Book of Cagliostro,Kang's Time Chair,Uatu's eye, aCosmic Cube,Angela'sIchors,Mandarin's Rings,Groot, aRaptor Amulet,Firelord's Staff,Snowbird's Tiara, andHyde Formula. The emporium was opened to the public as long as visitors paid 5000 ₳ for an entry ticket, and a gift shop was present which sold replicas of the items along with other souvenirs such as adollStar-Lordcan buy forGamora.[1]\nTheGuardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!Attraction atDisney California Adventure\nTheGuardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!is an accelerated drop tower dark ride attraction at theDisney California Adventure Parkset in the Collector's Museum Fortress.[16]"

Wanting to just enjoy life as a normal kid and not wanting to take on all the responsibilities that came with his awesome powers yet, Franklin secretly altered reality to pretend to be depowered after taking a stand against the alienCormorant.[18][14]Removing his ability to access his powers and memory of still having them (except for one day a year), Franklin made everyone believe, including himself, that he was a depowered human mutate all along, down to the genetic level, forfeiting his mutant status as well as revoking hisKrakoancitizenship in the process.[19][14]\nFirst, the radiation somehow affected Susan Richards' body in such a way as to give her serious difficulties in giving birth. For unknown reasons, soon before she was to give birth to Franklin, Susan Richards' blood cells were observed to be carrying a strange form of energy that threatened the lives of both herself and the baby. Presumably, this energy effect is linked with Susan Richards' superhuman powers over energy that enable her to become invisible and to create force fields.[16]\nBaby Franklin\nWith Franklin's birth imminent, Reed Richards and his teammates, theHuman Torchand theThing, journeyed into the anti-matter dimension called theNegative Zoneto find the only means known to Mister Fantastic of saving his wife and unborn son: theCosmic Control Rodwielded byAnnihilus, one of its most dangerous inhabitants. Mister Fantastic succeeded in obtaining the Rod and drained energy from it into a special container, which he and his two colleagues then brought to their own dimension. Reed Richards succeeded in using the energy from the Rod in bringing the energy in his wife's blood under control, and she safely gave birth to a healthy son.[16]The infant was named Franklin Benjamin Richards in honor of his late grandfather,Franklin Storm, and the Richards' best friend, Benjamin J. Grimm.[1]In his early years the sorceressAgatha Harknessacted as Franklin's nanny and protector.[20]\nThe cosmic radiation that had given Reed and Susan Richards their superhuman powers also resulted in affecting the genetic structure of their son: Franklin was born amutant. Unlike most superhuman mutants, whose unusual powers do not emerge until the mutant reaches puberty, Franklin began manifesting his superhuman powers at a very early age. The very first indication of his powers was shown when the Frightful Four had beaten the Fantastic Four, as a toddler Franklin Richards used this power to wake up the Thing and this allowed the Fantastic Four to achieve victory.[21]In the normal course of events, Franklin's psionic powers would presumably increasingly emerge as he grew older until they reach their full, vast potential when he achieved maturity. However, this normal process was ruined by Annihilus, who, during a later conflict with the Fantastic Four, placed Franklin within a machine that triggered the release of his full psionic potential. Franklin was too young and inexperienced to control the vast energies building up within him, and Reed Richards feared that his son would be unable to prevent himself from releasing enough psionic energy to destroy all life on Earth. Unable to find another means of dealing with the problem in the short space of time left before disaster would strike, Reed was forced to use a device that rendered Franklin comatose, and thus unable to project psionic energy.[22]\nMonths later, while the robot Ultron-7 was attacking the Fantastic Four and other superhuman beings, energy radiating from the robot affected Franklin's mind and caused him to unwittingly release great psionic energies which overpowered and defeatedUltron. Franklin was thus awakened from his coma, and his psionic powers were apparently now back at the level at which they were before Annihilus subjected him to his machine.[23][24]\nLater, Franklin used his powers to age himself into adulthood within a very brief space of time. (In this form he became known as Avatar.) Although his psyche remained that of a child, Franklin could now make full use of his psionic potential. Realizing he still lacked the emotional maturity to control his vast powers, Franklin transformed himself back into a child, imposing psychic \"dampers\" in his mind so he could not use his full powers until he achieved the necessary psychological maturity.[3]\nWhen thesymbioteescaped from theBaxter Buildingwith the help ofKristoff Vernard, the symbiote tried to possess Franklin, but Franklin was able to reject the symbiote thanks to his father andSpider-Man's help.[25]\nHowever, Franklin manifested the power to foresee events from alternate futures in his dreams.[26]Unknown to his parents, Franklin became a member ofPower Pack, a team of children possessing superhuman powers. He then took the \"superhero\" name Tattletale due to his ability to foresee the future. In one adventure involving Power Pack, Franklin even journeyed through outer space to the throne world of the alienSnarksand back to Earth. Franklin's \"dream\" power has also continued to evolve in other ways.[9]\nPsi-Lord\nLater, claiming that Franklin's presence in this timeline would lead to destruction, Reed Richards' fatherNathanielabducted the child into the future. (In fact, Nathaniel had learned about the Fantastic Four's forthcoming disappearance upon defeatingOnslaught, although he did not know about Onslaught himself.) Nathaniel raised Franklin for years in the future, training him to be a warrior and to master his superhuman powers. The adolescent Franklin journeyed back in time, arriving in the Fantastic Four's headquarters mere moments after Nathaniel had abducted him as a child.[27]The teenage Franklin called himselfPsi-Lord, and wielded vast psionic powers, although they remained far short of his full potential. For a long period Reed Richards was held captive by an enemy known as Hyperstorm. During this period, Franklin founded the Fantastic Force, a new superhero team to carry on his father's work of protecting humanity.[28]Finally, however, Psi-Lord somehow was removed from the Fantastic Four's time and was replaced by the child Franklin, as he had been at the time that Nathaniel had abducted him.[29]Nathaniel claimed thatHyperstormmust have arranged the substitution, and that the Psi-Lord version of Franklin no longer existed in the Fantastic Four's timeline. Ironically, according to Nathaniel Richards, Hyperstorm is the son of the Franklin Richards and Rachel Summers of yet another alternate future.[29]\nKidnaped by Onslaught\nThe malevolent entity Onslaught captured Franklin in order to manipulate the child's latent ability to reshape reality. Ultimately, the Fantastic Four and many of the Avengers dove into Onslaught's energy form in order to disrupt it; when the X-Men then launched a full assault on Onslaught, he was seemingly destroyed. The general public believed that the Fantastic Four and many of theAvengershad perished as well.[30]However, Franklin, who remained safely on Earth, had unconsciously used his vast psionic powers to create a\"pocket\" universein another reality, to which he transported the vanished heroes. There the Fantastic Four and the missing Avengers led radically different lives with no memories of their pasts in their native universe.[30]\nThe Daydreamers\nFranklin subsequently embarked on a journey through other alternate realities with the swamp creature called theMan-Thing, the other-dimensional talking waterfowlHoward the Duck, the alienTana Nile, and the mutantsArtie MaddicksandLeech. Franklin's companions finally realized that Franklin himself had created these worlds with his psionic powers.[31]\nFranklin was soon approached by the CelestialAshema, who showed Franklin that his parents (and Earth's other heroes) were alive. Franklin had subconsciously shunted them into a new reality, another Earth which resided in the blue globe Franklin had been carrying with him since Onslaught. Ashema forced Franklin to make a choice: one of the worlds had to die. Literally fleeing from this awful choice, Franklin plummeted over a cliff, nearly dying. To resurrect him, Ashema melded with Franklin's consciousness, acquiring his human perspective on life and death. Through Franklin, a compromise was struck: both worlds could live, but Earth's heroes had to leave Franklin’s creation and return to their own world.[32]Franklin's alternate Earth was later transported to our solar system byDr. Doomand placed in orbit on the far side of the sun, where it was named Counter-Earth.[33]\nReunited with his family, Franklin moved intoPier Four, the Fantastic Four’s new waterfront headquarters.[34]Franklin got a pet, a dog-like creature named Puppy who seemed a younger, smaller twin to theInhumans'Lockjaw, and a new caretaker, the dimensionally displacedCaledonia. Franklin also acquired a sister when the time-dancingValeria von Doom(claimed daughter of Susan Richards) joined the family. Franklin’s time at Pier Four proved brief; when catastrophe loomed, Reed and Sue sent Franklin, Puppy, and Caledonia to Haven, a school located on the far side of the universe, where they were soon joined by Valeria.[35]When Franklin dreamed of Valeria’s death at the hand of the cosmic forceAbraxas, he and Valeria returned to Earth. When Abraxas did appear, Valeria and Franklin combined their powers to resurrect the only being capable of stopping Abraxas:Galactus. Franklin learned that Valeria was the sister he had sent elsewhere, and he exhausted his remaining powers to restore her to his mother’s womb as an infant.[36]\nIn the wake of Mr. Fantastic's activation of theUltimate Nullifierto destroy Abraxas, Franklin lost all his powers in the process of reformingGalactusand thus became a normal child.[37]After Valeria’s birth, Franklin felt ignored and unloved, and his attempts to regain his parents attention inadvertently led to the creation of the mathematical menaceModulus.[38]\nShortly afterwards,Doctor Doommade a pact with theHaazareth Three, to gain vast magical power. During Doom's attacks upon the Fantastic Four, Franklin was sucked intoHellby the Haazareth. After the defeat of Doom, his parents rescued him. Franklin had a hard time coping with the traumatic experience of being tormented in Hell. With help from the Thing and Franklin's mother, he made a complete mental recovery.[39][40]\nBecause of the danger of their adventures, child Welfare questioned the safety of theBaxter Building, due to the numerous super-villain attacks on it.[41]After much reluctance, Reed and Sue agreed that if necessary, their children could be taken away.[42]However, an initial condition was that a \"dummy\" safe house was to be set up, and a press release to be announced that the children had already been moved. It is uncertain exactly which of the FF's enemies carried out the attack, or why (there is speculation that Reed carried out the attack himself to allow him and Sue to keep the kids), but it was enough to convince Child Welfare.[43]\nWhen theScarlet Witchused her powers todepowercountless mutants, includingMagnetoandProf. Xavier, the power lost by Magneto and Xavier combined and restored Onslaught (whose consciousness still remained lingering after his death), who was now determined to kill Franklin Richards and every hero in existence. Onslaught took control of both theHuman TorchandMister Fantasticin an attempt to get Franklin but was interrupted by theThingandInvisible Woman.[44]\nWhen Franklin fled toCounter-Earth, Onslaught followed him. While the Avengers assessed their new threat which did not exist until Franklin appeared, they took into account what the boy said about Onslaught. However, they were in disbelief that he was the son of Susan Storm and Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four as they were not married in their reality. After a brief skirmish, the heroes and villains decided to work together to defeat Onslaught, but it wasRikki \"Bucky\" Barneswho defeated him, using aFantasti-Carto send them both through theNegative Zonebarrier in the Fantastic Four's lab, trapping them. Franklin returned home, Bucky found herself on Earth-616, and Onslaught was last seen floating outsidePrison 42in the Negative Zone.[45]\nIn the beginning of theSkrullstrike on Earth, the SkrullLyja, impersonating Sue Richards, sent the entire Baxter Building into theNegative Zonewith Franklin, Valeria, and Johnny Storm inside. Franklin and Valeria teamed up with Johnny and the Thing to fight the Skrulls. Benjamin Grimm asked the help of theTinkerer, who was an inmate in Prison 42 within the Negative Zone. The Tinkerer refused, seeing no reason to help the people who arrested him as he was taking his grandchildren out for ice cream, and sent him to prison without due process. Franklin and Valeria pleaded with the Tinkerer and strongly reminded the old man of his own grandchildren. He was moved to tears, repented and agreed to help, in exchange for his freedom and reunion with his grandkids.[46][47]\nFacing the news of mutant and anti-mutant riots inSan Francisco, Franklin asked his mother and father why people hate mutants and if that meant they hate him.[48]\nDefending the Baxter Building\nFranklin found himself along with his sister under siege by Norman Osborn, Venom and a high number of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. The siblings were on their own due to their father's experiment which left him unreachable and the other members of the Fantastic Four stranded in alternate realities.[49]\nValeria managed to separate Osborn from the rest of theH.A.M.M.E.R.agents by using a bureaucratic technicality and by having them underestimate her. Osborn was led into a room where he faced Franklin wearing aSpider-Manmask and called him a villain, making him chase them in the building and intending to shot them down.[50]\nThe Fantastic Four have resurfaced by this point with an angry Invisible Woman telling Osborn \"Step away from the children\". Angry, he snapped that she should try to make him. Sue obliged by smashing him against a wall using one of her invisible force fields. Osborn retaliated by summoning H.A.M.M.E.R. agents andVenom. None however managed to pass through Sue's barrier.[51]\nMr. Fantastic informed Osborn to leave the Baxter Building and not to come back, dismissing him. Infuriated, he attempted to shoot Reed, only to be shot by Franklin in turn. Although all are shocked, none understood how Franklin managed to shoot Norman since Franklin was only wielding a toy gun (both Johnny and Ben examine the gun once it was shot) hinting that perhaps some of Franklin's reality altering abilities had resurfaced.[51]\nFranklin creating a universe\nAn alternate version of himself from the future returned, and stated \"Rest ... and remember what you are.\" Moments later after being put to bed, Franklin created a Universe with his powers, hinting that his nigh unlimited power had returned.[52]\nFranklin, against his father's prior wishes, used his reality-warping powers to free Ben Grimm from the possession of an Asgardian warrior general namedAngrir, Breaker of Soulsby transforming him back into the Thing.[53]\nWhen Franklin created a pocket universe, a mysterious imaginary friend appeared who advised him and helped him to use his powers. Not long afterwards, the Human Torch seemingly died at the hands of Annihilus to save his family. The Fantastic Four disbanded and became the Future Foundation.[54]\nDue to the threat of theInterdimensional Council of Reeds, Mr. Fantastic made an alliance with many villains such as Mad Thinker, AIM, the Wizard, Diablo, and the High Evolutionary to plan how to stop them. They took the battle to High Evolutionary's city where one of theReedsescaped with Doctor Doom and the other two were captured by the Kree army. After returning to theBaxter Building, Richards reunited other heroes to fight the Inhumans in Attilan, but at the time they were preparing to go at the rooftop, a Kree invasion started. Reed used Iron Man's armor and Sue's power to create a force field around Manhattan, at the same time theCult of the Negative Zoneopened the portal to theNegative ZoneafterSpider-Manfailed at stop them, the portal revealed a living Johnny Storm with an enslaved Annihilus.[6]\nJohnny gathered the team together, drawing with fire the symbolic \"4\" in the sky above the Baxter Building. Reed, Sue, Ben, and Peter boarded one of the Annihilation Wave's ships controlled by Johnny, who used the rest of the ships to battle the Kree army until the Inhumans asked to finish them by their own hand.[55]Meanwhile the other heroes on Earth were dealing with the scraps of the battle which could damage the Earth. Reed and Sue summoned Galactus, who destroyed the Kree army. At that moment, theMad Celestialsappeared to destroy this universe. Although the team tried to use the Hub (a weapon of mass destruction created by the Reeds), they couldn't defeat the Mad Celestials. However, future versions ofFranklinandValeriaappeared as part ofNathaniel Richards's plan.[56]Future Franklin used his powers to heal Galactus and destroy the Mad Celestials, saving the day.[57]Later, the Baxter Building was rebuilt and Mr. Fantastic showed a new secondary headquarters calledFoundationand new costumes were given to the members of the Future Foundation, also with the new additions of the future Franklin and Valeria, with the Franklins getting the number 5 on their costumes.[7]\nWith the Multiverse coming to its inevitable end, caused by theincursions, theIlluminatitried to find numerous ways to save Earth-616 from its destruction. One of their ideas consisted of using a machine to access and harness the full measure of Franklin's latent powers to create a pocket universe that the inhabitants of Earth could be relocated to. The plan did not succeed.[58]Following the incident, Sue informed Reed that Franklin was under the impression that he \"disappointed\" his father; Reed replied, \"I should never have done that. I should never have asked.\"[59]\nWhen it was realized the Multiverse was truly doomed, Franklin and the Future Foundation began constructing vessels that would allow a small number of humans to survive.[60]As the final incursion betweenEarth-616andEarth-1610took place, Franklin's father Reed gathered every person he could upon thelife raftincluding members of the Future Foundation, Franklin, and the rest of his family. When the vessel approached the central point of the incursion, it suffered a hull breach that led to the deaths of Franklin, his family minus his father Reed, and the members of the Future Foundation aboard.[61]\nShaping universes for the Eighth Cosmos\nEight years later, Reed gained the omnipotent power of theBeyondersfrom theMolecule Manafter stripping them from Doctor Doom. With his new powers, Reed brought his family, including Franklin, and the Future Foundation back to life. Franklin and his family then began helping his father and Molecule Man restore the Multiverse, while also creating entirely new realities.[17]\nYears into the Future Foundation's multiversal adventures, Franklin became depleted of his ability to create entirely new realities. At this moment the team was confronted by an abstract entity called theGriever at the End of All Thingswho repudiated their mission of creating new universes. She caused the collapse of the hundreds of universes charted by the Future Foundation, forcing the team to make a final stand. The Fantastic Four were reunited when Mister Fantastic tricked the Griever into giving them the chance to summon the remaining members of the Fantastic Four for backup. In addition to teleporting Ben and Johnny, Reed also brought every superhero who had been part of the team at one point in order to defeat the new foe.[2]After the Griever was driven away, the Future Foundation continued their multiversal travels, but Reed, Sue, Franklin and Valeria returned with Ben and Johnny to Earth, where only months had passed since the Foundation's years-long journey.[62]\nAs his father Reed was unable to fix his power loss, Franklin began to doubt his father's intentions. Around this time,Charles Xavierhad established a new mutant-only nation inKrakoa, and his desire to have Franklin join them became a point of contention between the X-Men and the Fantastic Four.[63]When Franklin attempted to visit Krakoa, he was intercepted by Doctor Doom, who took him to the hidden mutant territoryDoom Islandand offered him to fix his powers.[64]With Reed's reluctant blessing, Franklin agreed to undergo a procedure to restore his powers. However, when the X-Men's intervention in Doom Island prompted Victor to unleash hisLatviathans,[65]Franklin interrupted the procedure to stop the murderous robots, and his powers remained broken.[66]With the Fantastic Four and the X-Men setting aside their differences, Franklin became a citizen of Krakoa.[66]He would regularly visit the mutant nation and immerse himself in mutant culture.[67]\nFranklin wearing an X-Men uniform\nDuring the Fantastic Four's confrontation against the unstoppable alienCormorant, Franklin used the last remains of his powers in an attempt to stop the enemy, but failed. When Franklin attempted to use a KrakoanGateway, he was unable to pass through.[18]When the Fantastic Four came in the possession of theForever Gate, a programmable doorway into every point in space and time, Franklin attempted to use it to travel to Krakoa. He was interrupted telepathically by Xavier, who informed Franklin of the discovery that his mutant status had been a result of his powers subconsciously altering his anatomy in a cellular level. With his powers gone, Franklin was no longer a mutant, and his acceptance into Krakoa was revoked.[19]While in reality, Franklin consciously placed new mental blocks on himself, so that he would only be able to access his powers one day a year, and would only remember he had his powers that same day. With that, Franklin had himself, and everyone else, believe that he was never a mutant, and no longer had his powers.[14]\nDespite somewhat hurt feelings at the belief of the loss of his mutant identity, Franklin attended theHellfire Galawith his family, displaying friendship withKate Pryde.[68]\nAlong with the rest of the Fantastic Four's children and theBaxter Building, Reed Richards sent Franklin exactly one year into the future in a desperate ploy to defeat invaders from theNegative Zone, whose forces were sent six months into the past on the opposite side of the sun.[69]After a year passed, which for the children was just a moment, Franklin and the others finally returned and were reunited with their families. As the Fantastic Four had moved on from the Baxter Building, the entire family translocated to theFantastic FarmhouseinBenson,Arizonawhere the children began attending a new school.[70]\nFranklin possesses vast telepathic powers, tremendous telekinetic powers, the ability to fire enormously powerful energy blasts, and the ability to rearrange the molecular structure of matter and energy. His powers are so great that he has been able to create pocket universes, and his abilities have been described as equal to theCelestials.[71][72]For comparison purposes, a single Celestial is the embodiment of energies comparable to the Big Bang itself and powerful enough to reverberate throughout the entire universe.[73]In fact, Franklin's ultimate potential is so colossal that it has been described by himself as abovemultiversallevel in magnitude.[13]Franklin's powers came from him being amutant, and he was considered anOmega-level mutant;[11][12][14]once stated to be evenbeyond Omega classification.[15]Even when Franklin was a little boy,Galactusfeared Franklin and once fled the Earth to avoid a confrontation with him.[74]He was regarded as a threat by the Celestials, who recognized his ability to distort reality and shape the universe.[15]\nThe child Franklin and Valeria combined proved powerful enough to capture and restore the very essence of Galactus, that was hidden in the heart of Eternity, effectively resurrecting him.[37]By combining the abilities of his present and future selves, Franklin was able to empower and control a previously defeated Galactus to destroy twoMad Celestials.[57]Also, during the same battle the adult Franklin Richards was able to withstand attacks from the Mad Celestials and even destroyed one of them. In fact, only an extremely fed Galactus[75]and Reed Richards with the Universal Entropy Gun[76]were capable to perform this feat, while even theUltimate Nullifierwas unable to destroy one Mad Celestial (though it could be attributed to the wielder's weak mind).[77]Moreover, he was even able to cause damage in the nefarious entityMephisto, whose raw power was vastly boosted by evil energies and was beyond its standard extent.[78]In addition, an adult version of Franklin was once described as \"the great enemy of the omniversal order\".[79]\nFranklin Richards is described as an \"enemy of omniversal order\"\nFranklin's age is the age not spoken"

Despite facing challenges and self-doubt, he played a significant role in missions against various villains.[14]Dunphy joined theAvengerson an informal basis and took part in various missions.[15]He faced personal struggles, including battling schizophrenia and participating in events like the superheroCivil War.[16]He even joinedWonder Man'sRevengers, a group dedicated to dismantling the Avengers seeing them as a threat to the world.[17]\nManipulated byHydra, Dunphy became the newScourge, meeting his demise at the hands ofSharon Carter.[18]However, he was later resurrected under mysterious circumstances,[8]and aided heroes and battling threats like theHiveand thePoisons.[9]After further adventures and apparent deaths, He settled down with his boyfriend,Chrisand adoptedLockjaw's brotheras his own pet.[10]Dunphy then took a job as a security guard atRavencroft Institute, handling the dangerous inmates and even a horde ofVampires. Sadly he was infected becoming a creature of the night himself.[19]\nDennis Dunphy was born and raised inDetroit,Michigan. As a young man, he idolized superheroes. A successful college football player, he hoped to be recruited as a professional, but despite trying out for a number of teams, he was chosen by none.[12]When he was approached by an agent of thePower Brokerand offered the chance to undergo a process to increase his physical strength to superhuman levels, hoping this would increase his chances of being a professional football player. He agreed, and had his strength boosted, but with his new-found power, he could not safely compete against regular athletes.[3]\nThe Power Broker offered him a place in the newUnlimited Class Wrestling Federation(UCWF), where he could use his augmented strength against other similarly augmented wrestlers. He fought with theThing (Ben Grimm), among others, and called himself \"Demolition Dunphy.\"[20]\nUnbeknownst to Dunphy, Power Brokers Inc. was a criminal organization. They supplied pills to their clients, purportedly to stabilize their metabolisms after the treatments, but in reality to keep them addicted to the pills and under their control.[21]Grimm andMs. Marvel (Sharon Ventura)(a fellow client of Power Brokers and UCWF wrestler) discovered that approximately half of Power Brokers' clients had come out of their treatments with brain damage or deformities. Power Brokers commanded some of their clients, including Dunphy, to capture Grimm and Ventura, and threatened to withhold their pills if they refused. Dunphy followed his conscience, however, and refused to betray his friends. Although he went through a harrowing two weeks of withdrawal, he freed himself from Power Brokers' control.[22]\nCaptain Americatook an interest in Power Broker Inc. because of one of its clients, theSuper-Patriot. Dunphy allied himself with Rogers, created a costume based on those of Daredevil and Wolverine, and capturedKarl Malus, the head scientist. Soon afterward, Power Broker's agents captured Dunphy and put him through more treatments, which resulted in a heart attack.[2]He was rescued by Captain America. While he was recovering from his heart attack, Dunphy operated Rogers's telephone hotline.\nAfterJohn Walkersupplanted Rogers as Captain America, Rogers became a costumed adventurer known as The Captain, receiving from Dunphy a black costume inspired by his original uniform. Dunphy,Nomad (Jack Monroe), theFalcon, andVagabondjoined Rogers on several missions, going up against theSerpent Society, the Horseman of the ApocalypseFamine, and a group of superhuman criminals who had broken out of the prison for super villains known as theVault. In the latter conflict, Demolition-Man tried to apprehend the villainessTitania. However, Titania's strength far exceeded his, and she threw him off a cliff, nearly killing him. After the encounter with Titania, Dunphy lost confidence in himself.[23]\nThroughout their partnership with the Captain, Dunphy found himself in an adversarial relationship with Nomad. While Rogers and Wilson were welcoming to Dunphy as an ally, Monroe saw him as a naive goody-two-shoes, and grew increasingly paranoid that Dunphy would put the moves on Vagabond. When Vagabond asked Dunphy to train her in unarmed combat, Monroe attempted to fight Dunphy, only for Vagabond to throw Monroe into a pool. Further fighting was interrupted by the arrival of envoys of theBlack Panther, who had arrived to deliver a newVibraniumshield to Rogers.[24]\nDuring theViper's insurrection inWashington, D.C., after she had taken control of the Serpent Society, the Captain had managed to subdue her, but afterCobra's bungled attempt to kill her (interfered with by Nomad) ended up disabling her restraints instead, she took advantage of the situation and bit Dunphy on the neck, poisoning him.Diamondback, who, having remained loyal to the Society's founderSidewinder, had been helping Cap and his allies fight the Viper, gave Dunphy an anti-toxin. However, the two soon encountered Walker and his partner,Battlestar, who took them for aiding the insurrection. Dunphy fought Battlestar, but in his weakened condition was no match for him, and he was taken into custody by theCommission on Superhuman Activitiesfor interrogation, along with Diamondback (who was captured by Walker) and Nomad (who was found unconscious, having been beaten by a poisoned mob).[25]In exchange for their group's help in saving him, Sidewinder offered Dunphy a chance to escape custody along with Diamondback and Nomad, but Dunphy chose to stay behind, believing it is what Rogers would do, much to Nomad's chagrin.[26]\nDemolition-Man\nUpon his release, Dunphy found Rogers trying to reconstitute his team theAvengers, and Dunphy joined the team on an informal basis. To help Battlestar, Dunphy and Rogers flew to the Arctic to rescue Battlestar's partner, the currentCaptain America(and former Super-Patriot), fromU.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.. Dunphy, still unsure of himself, waited in an AvengersQuinjetwhile Rogers and Battlestar investigated. When Rogers learned that U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. was about to trigger an electromagnetic pulse, he asked Dunphy to crash the Quinjet into the base. Before Dunphy could eject, two U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. agents tried to plant bombs on the aircraft. One bomb went off. The Quinjet crashed into the base and stopped the pulse, but Dunphy sank into the ocean with the Quinjet wreckage and was presumed dead.[15]\nDunphy miraculously survived the crash and lived with an Inuit tribe, but he lost his voice and much of his vitality. TheFalconandUS Agentrescued him after he was kidnapped by ULTIMATUM. Rogers, with the help of other Avengers, nursed Dunphy back to health.[27]Dunphy then discovered Zerotown, underground home of the Zero People, and became their protector.[28]\nDuring the Morgan Conquest, whenMorgan Le Feyreshaped reality to her liking, every living Avenger became an unwilling member of the Queen's Vengeance, her bodyguards. Dunphy took the name Serf.[29]\nPossibly as a delayed after-effect of the Power Broker treatments, Dunphy became schizophrenic. He believed that a voice was instructing him to collect theInfinity Gems. Instead he stole ordinary gems. Daredevil convinced Dunphy to get treatment for his illness.[30]\nDunphy sided against theSuperhuman Registration Actduring theCivil War, alongsideCaptain America.[16]After the Civil War, he was listed as a potential recruit for theInitiative.[31]\n...[32]\nDuringDark Reign, he enlisted in theU.S. Armyserving inIraqHe covertly operated as D-Man when he could, enlisting the help of his fellow soldiers.[33]\nAt a picnic held by the Avengers he competed in a pie eating contest and beat the Thing,Noh-Varr, and theValkyrie.[34]\nHe was one of the many applicants for nanny toLuke CageandJessica Jones' daughter,Danielle Cage.[35]\nPrior toWar of the Serpent, D-Man joinedWonder Man'sRevengers, a group dedicated to dismantling the Avengers, and successfully attacked theAvengers Mansion.[17]He was defeated by the combined forces of theAvengersandNew Avengers, and when he was interrogated, he posed as a pawn of theGrandmaster, wanting to get back theInfinity Gemsfor him, but that the Avengers never answered to him. It is unclear whether D-Man was aware that theIlluminatiactually possessed the Gems at this time.[36]\nScourge\nSomehow, Dunphy escaped or was freed from prison, and was used byHenry GyrichandHydrato mind-control him to turn him into the newScourge.[37]Sharon Carter was forced to fatally shoot Dunphy during his encounter with Captain America.[38]\nDunphy was revived by a boy wishing to summon a demon (and instead had D-Man resurrected). After visiting theAvengers Mansion, meeting withJarvisandRage, he had the best day of his life, just before being killed by theincursionbetweenEarth-616andEarth-1610.[8]When the universe was brought back, Dennis started working for the newCaptain Americaas a pilot, mechanic, technician, and field backup, and bought himself a battle armor to \"finally look cool.\"[39]\nD-Man bonded to a symbiote before being assimilated\nWhen theHiveinvaded Earth, they sent agents to forceSymbiotesinto bonding with superhumans, so then aPoisoncould assimilate both the Symbiote and its host. Together with Rage, D-Man oversaw the evacuation ofManhattanthrough theManhattan Bridge. They were both attacked by a group of Poisons and bonded to symbiotes. Shortly afterwards, they were each consumed by a Poison, resulting in their deaths.[9]\nDespite his apparent death, Dennis returned, having broken up with his boyfriend,Chris, and apparently having lost his powers. He assistedLockjawin saving Lockjaw's siblings fromAnnihilus. He ultimately adopted one ofLockjaw's brothersas his own pet.[10][40]\nVampire Physiology:After having lost his powers at some point,[10]Dunphy was eventually turned into avampireto save his life after he was mortally wounded.[43]\nPower Broker Physiology:Dunphy was undergoing various treatments designed by thePower Broker. As a result, he possesses superhuman abilities including:[44]"

After Shadrak designed the bomb, he managed to escape Gorr by hiding in the one place he never thought to look: the cave where he was defeated by Thor. Meanwhile, Gorr set out to build the doomsday device himself.[3]\nAs he needed the heart of anelder god, one or two moons and some centuries to build the Godbomb,[1]Gorr traveled toChronux, a planet inhabited by theTime Gods, to use thePool of Foreversto travel through thetimestream.[4]\nAfter having secured the heart of a misbegotten stripling elder god, Gorr used the pool once again to travelthousands of years into the future, where he spent the next 900 years slaughtering and enslaving deities in order to build the Godbomb.[5]It took four hundred years for it to be completely built,[6]and upon its near completion, Gorr took the younger version of Thor fromthe pastto the future to witness his crowning accomplishment's fruition.[5]\nThe Godbomb's Core\nThe Pool of Forevers built into its core and fueled by the blood of the thousands of gods slain by Gorr enabled the bomb to send a ripple backward through time, exploding through every second and infecting every god across the timestream with a portion of the All-Black symbiote, which also served as the bomb's detonator.[7]"

Doom used the Molecule Men bomb to slay the Beyonders and steal their power.[8]\nAlthough the Beyonders were successful in destroying the Multiverse, Doctor Doom used their power to salvage its remnants and createdBattleworld.[8]Their power was later transferred over toReed Richards, who used it to recreate the Multiverse as theEighth Cosmos.[15]\nThe Celestials creating the Beyonders\nThe Beyonders were created by theCelestials' own creation,Cal-Horra,[16][17][18]intended by the Celestials to keep maintenance of theMultiverse, theSecond Cosmos, following theCelestial War.[2]They stole Cal-Horra's power, trapped him in a moonoutsidethe Multiverse,[19]and erased him from their history.[10]Nevertheless, they were servitors of the Celestials and were called \"Omegas\" by them, in opposition to theFirst Firmament.[12]After the death of the Second Cosmos, the Beyonders watched over theMultiverses that came afterin theSecond Cosmos' remnants, outside the subsequent Multiverses.[2]\nAlthough normally working behind the scenes, they occasionally intervened to allow the creation ofCosmic Cubes.[20]When theFirst Firmamentsent some of itsAspirantsto invade theSeventh Cosmos,[12]the Omegas developed thereality warpingConcordance Enginesto draw \"miracles\" to the planetEarthso that the resulting superheroes could defend against the Aspirants. These engines, guarded by Presters,[21]were supposedly the reason for why Earth is the focal point of everything in the cosmos.[9]\nThe \"Ivory Kings\" or the \"Kings in White\"\nThe Beyonders were divided into groups. The godlikeOmega Councilcoordinated the race's actions from \"Heaven\";[22]they also created theLibrary of Worldsand gifted it to the Multiverse.[4]ThePresterslived on Earth to protect the Concordance Engines.[21]Some Beyonders became rogues and joined theBeyond Corporation.[11]\nOn Earth, the Beyonders commissioned theNuwalito create theSavage Landand created theFortisquiansto be colonizers.[23]When theHigh Evolutionarystarted to collect the extra-dimensional mass he needed to buildhis Counter-Earth, the Beyonders took notice and hired the alienSphinxorto observe his progress and make preparations to steal the planet for them once it was completed.[24]\nThe \"bomb\" to destroy the Multiverse\nWhen the Beyonders foresaw thatEnigma, aDominion, would threaten theSeventh Cosmos, they decided to destroy theMultiversethemselves, hoping that the nextEighth Cosmoswould be rid of it.[2][25]As part of their biggest experiment yet, the Beyonders created a singularity across every reality: theMolecule Man. Each Molecule Man would take his universe with him once he died and the Beyonders planned to bear witness to the simultaneous death of everything in the Multiverse. The time-travelingDoctor DoomandMolecule ManofEarth-616united forces to thwart their plans by killing every Molecule Man in existence before his natural death.[13][8]However, a contraction in the Multiverse, both in its timeline and the proximity of realities, was created when the universe of the first Molecule Man victim died with him, forcing two universes to collide, their respectiveEarthsserving as the point of impact.[26][13][27]This event became known as anincursion.[26]To the Beyonders, this was by their design.[1]\nA decade year later and two years after Doom (as \"Rabum Alal\") had founded theBlack Swans, the Beyonders noticed the interference and created theMapmakersandSidera Maristo chart worlds where Molecule Men had died, thus marking the movements of the Black Swans, seeding sacrifice worlds, and preserving future incursion worlds.[13]By derailing the Beyonders' initial goal of a simultaneous destruction, Doom believed he had caused the Beyonders' great experiment to fail,[13]but the Beyonders themselves thought otherwise and the incursions were still part of their experiment.[1][28][29][2]\nObliterating Eternity, Infinity, Lord Chaos, Master Order, and the In-Betweener\nThe Beyonders laid a trap for those trying to interfere with the incursions, like theBuildersorCaptain Britain Corps; however, their real targets werecosmic entities. The Beyonders annihilated theCelestials,Eternity,Infinity,Lord Chaos,Master Order, theIn-Betweener, and even theLiving Tribunalthroughout all realities.[30]\nDoom luring out the Beyonders\nNot long after killing theMultiversal Avengers,[1]the Beyonders were lured out of their dimension by Doctor Doom and were destroyed by his bomb made from kidnapped Molecule Men. Doom had the Molecule Man absorb their power and used it to createBattleworldout of the Multiverse's remnants.[13][8]After eight years, the Molecule Man transferred the power of the Beyonders toReed Richards, who first restored thePrime Earthand then therest of the Multiverse.[15]\nNot all of the Beyonders were killed. The race survived outside of the Multiverse, and seeing how the Multiverse was restored to how it was before, they concluded their experiment to be a failure.[2]\nAt some point, a Beyonder caused several wars in the reality ofEarth-21923. TheGuardians of the Galaxy, minusStar-Lord, were instrumental in ending the wars, but at the cost ofGroot's life.[31]\nCal-Horra, an ancient being created by theCelestialswhose power the Beyonders had stolen, escaped from his prison outside the Multiverse that the Beyonders had trapped him in. He immediately launched a vengeful campaign against the Beyonders.[19]In an effort to save himself and his people, theBeyonderattacked four other Beyonders and turned them into crystals to power a shield that would trap the Lost One onEarth, after luring him there.[32]Although the other Beyonders were grateful, they were also displeased that he attacked his fellow Beyonders to do this and banished him to Earth without his powers.[10]Anticipating that the other Beyonders would erase his memory of how to disable the shield, the Beyonder had extracted it beforehand and used it to make a deal with the Lost One. The shield was disabled, the four Beyonders powering it were absorbed by the Lost One, and he left to continue his hunt.[33]\nWith a Concordance Engine\nTheDefenders, in their journey through the \"Mystery\" beyond theFar Shore, first entered the Beyond.[34]TheBeyondergreeted them and revealed the origin of the Beyonders. The other Beyonders explained that they believed the destruction of the Seventh Cosmos was a \"necessary experiment\" to prevent theEnigma, but they have since changed tactics to contain the threat to a few realities. After a brief battle, the Defenders journeyed beyond the Beyond and into theWhite Hot Room.[2]\n\nBeyonders are non-corporeal energy beings.[35]According to theBeyonder, they are infinite beings that cannot be perceived by finite minds, but they can \"clothe\" themselves in matter to take on various forms.[2]In general, they resemble humans,grey aliens, or mechanical beings, but none of these are their true forms and they can shapeshift at will.[1]Beyonders sometimes placeOmegasymbols (Ω) on their bodies or clothes.[36][2]\nThree Beyonders slaying the Living Tribunal\nNigh-Omnipotence:The Beyonders wield omnipotence on their fingertips, a power great enough to build entire universes and give form to random ideas.[8]Although this power does not belong to them but belongs to their purported creator, Cal-Horra.[10]While in physical vessels, they can decide how powerful they are, with a single Beyonder having easily overwhelmedThor,Hyperion, andStarbrand, suffering no visible damage from their attacks until Starbrand's detonation,[1]and a trio of Beyonders having killed all the Celestials in all realities with a good bit of time and effort, before killing all theAbstract Entitiesand then theLiving Tribunalitself.[30]Such is their power that they are not constrained by space or energy or anything within reason.[1]\nA bomb made of countless Molecule Men destroying the Beyonders\nBeyonder,\"Jason Quantrell\",Omega Council,Prester John,Prester Omega."

As Ra himself couldn't stop her rampage, he tricked her by dying a vast amount of beer red[4](7000 jars).[1]Sekhmet, thinking it was blood, drank herself unconscious, transforming her back into Hathor, goddess of love.[4]\nTo prevent that from happening again, Ra fashioned theOrb of Rafrom Hathor's right eye, but Hathor was overcome by bloodlust and became Upper Egypt war goddess.[1]\nSekhmet believed[1]that she was originally a lioness that had answered Ra's call to punish the people of Egypt,\"steeped in pride and perfidy\", and that she was transformed intoSekhmet, Lady of slaughter, divine instrument of his wrath.[4]Hathor was also considered as Sekhmet's half-sister.[2]\nSekhmet is the feline sibling ofBast, the Panther God(also containing male and female forms),[2]who served asLower Egyptwar goddess.[1]\nOne of Sekhmet's first conquests was thedemonApep[4](theElder GodSet).[6]\nSekhmet and Bast maintained influential cults in ancient Egypt, with Sekhmet in Upper Egypt, and Bast in Lower Egypt.[2]\nWhen the mortal pharaohs rose to power, theHeliopolitansventured elsewhere, including Bast who went to Wakanda, and Sekhmet absorbed Bast's power base in Lower Egypt, becoming a patron to the new mortal ruling class.

Beings from outside the Multiverse known as theBeyonders(the \"Ivory Kings\") sought to destroy it by creatingMolecule Menin every reality to simultaneously destroy all realities. A time-travellingDoctor Doom(\"Rabum Alal\") and theMolecule Man of Earth-616attempted to thwart their plan by killing Molecule Men early; however, the Molecule Men's deaths caused a contraction in the Multiverse, and realities began colliding with other realities with theirEarthsserving as the focal point: theincursions.[2][3]\nMany groupswere involved in the Game of Worlds, including theIlluminatiand theCabal, but in the end, nothing could stop the incursions from ending the Multiverse. Time ran out, and only two realities remained:Earth-616andEarth-1610.[4]\nOn one side of the Multiverse,Doctor Doom,Doctor Strange, and theMolecule Manwere confronting theBeyonders. They demanded to know who dared stand before them, and Doom presented himself.\nDoctor Doom, Doctor Strange, and the Molecule Man confronting the Beyonders\nMeanwhile, onEarth-1610,Nick Furywas making the final arrangements for the upcoming and finalincursion, and soon after sent all ofS.H.I.E.L.D.'s fleet towardsEarth-616. The fleet arrived to the incursion point, theManhattanof Earth-616 and started firing at it. Numerous heroes tried to fend off the attackers. At theBaxter Building,Mister Fantasticwas finishing getting ready theLife Raftto be used to save a small portion of humanity. TheIron Man from Earth-1610deployed theIron Man Sixweapon, but the tide of the battle is turned in favor of the heroes of the Marvel Universe when theGuardians of the GalaxyandCyclops'Sentinelsarrived to help. Other powerhouse heroes likeDoc GreenandShe-Hulkarrived to Earth-1610 and stormed theTriskelion.\nThe final incursion\nOnce the Triskelion fell, theMakerdeployed theChildren of Tomorrowto attack. After the vessel transporting the Earth's \"resurrection team\" was destroyed by the Children, Mr. Fantastic was forced to put the life raft in action. As the life raft was deployed,Manifoldteleported numerous heroes into it:Spider-Man,Star-Lord,Thor,Captain Marvel, and Cyclops, who had recently used aPhoenix Eggto become thePhoenixonce more. TheCabaland theMakerwere also able to create their own raft, with stolen designs from the original.\nAs Earth-616's life raft approached to the central point of the incursion, it suffered a hull breach, causing the portion containing the Richards family to drift away. TheInvisible Womantried to reconnect it to the rest of the structure, but failed, and it was destroyed. The rest of the life raft teleported away as the two universes collided and were destroyed.[5]\nElsewhere, inanother world, a gathering of alternate versions ofThorwitnessed the ceremony held atDoomgardin which theThorofHigher Avalonjoined their ranks. The Thor Corps are a police force under the command of their God, Doctor Doom.Old Man Thorand the new Thor set out to do justice. Meanwhile, in theKingdom of Utopolis, theFoundationdiscovered one of the life rafts, partially buried in the ground.\nGod Emperor Doom; Susan, Franklin, and Valeria von Doom; and Sheriff Strange\nAfter retrievingMister Sinisterfrom theBar Sinister, the Thors brought him toCastle Doomfor trial. After being found guilty of allying himself withKing Hyperion, the Baron of Utopolis, Sinister demanded his right of meeting his accuser in the arena. His accuser,Brian BraddockofHigher Avalonconfronted Sinister and was defeated. Before Sinister could deliver the final blow, Doom stopped the fight. Doom confronted Braddock, who apparently had helped theKingdom of Manhattanin planning to overthrown Doom.Jamie Braddockrevealed himself to be the traitor, and he was sent to theShieldto be punished by being exiled to one of the deadliest domains of the world, theDeadlands. After the trial was held,Valeria von Doominformed SheriffStephen Strangeabout the Foundation's discovery, and that the readings from it concluded it would date from before the \"beginning of time\" (when Doom created this world). The Thors investigated the life raft, and from it emerged the Cabal, who immediately killed the Old Thor. WhenThanosdemanded one of theMoloidspresent in the scene to inform them of their location, the Moloid revealed they were inBattleworld.[6]\nBack to Castle Doom, Sheriff Strange was reading Emperor Doom a report of minor incidents that had occurred in Battleworld. The routine was interrupted by Doom, who dismissed the reports, and felt something was wrong with Stephen. Strange and Doom started discussing the nature of Battleworld and what was before it, when the Sheriff was interrupted by news fromDoomgard. Sheriff Strange traveled toUtopolis, to investigate the life raft and the death of the Old Thor. After sending the Thor Corps to scout for the strangers, Strange revealed the existence of another person still inside the life raft, theSpider-ManofEarth-1610.\nAt one of the towers of Castle Doom, Sue Storm met with Emperor Doom, where Victor ultimately confessed he felt he was failing his duty as a god, he felt he wasn't capable of properly inspiring his people, and even though Battleworld is the perfect world he wanted, he considered himself its only flaw, which included the scars on his face, which he hadn't been able to cure. Sue repudiated Victor's claims and praised him, suggesting him that to create a stronger link with his people he should establish contact with them.\nSurvivors of the two life rafts\nStrange brought Spider-Man and the Thor of Higher Avalon to his secret Sanctum Sanctorum, the hiddenIsle of Agamotto, a place of remembrance for the lost world. Strange revealed he had found a vessel similar to the raft the Cabal had came from three years ago. Once it was opened, the survivors from the side of Earth-616 were revealed. Strange greeted the other inhabitants of his native universe, specially his fellow Illuminati, Black Panther and Mr. Fantastic. When questioned, Strange revealed eight years had passed since the last incursion, and the creation of Battleworld, a patchwork planet constructed with the remnants of incursion points between collapsing worlds, where nobody remembered their past lives.\nIn Utopolis, night had fallen and the Cabal had made a fire, and a few moments later, they were pinned down by the Thor Corps,[7]and engaged with them in combat. Meanwhile, Sheriff Strange explained to the new-found survivors that when Doom and him confronted the Beyonders, they were able to kill them, and while Stephen didn't, Doom took their power for himself and used it to build Battleworld from the remains of the Multiverse. The hammer of the Thor from Higher Avalon started glowing, meaning he was being called for battle. Shortly after Doom was informed of the conflict against the Cabal, Strange and the heroes from Earth-616 stepped in and turned the tide of the battle in favor of the Thor Corps.\nDoom remained unwilling to take part of the conflict until he saw Mr. Fantastic in the scene, he immediately teleported to Utopolis, and stopped the fray, demanding the newcomers to recognize his authority. Cyclops tried to best Doom, but was killed with little effort. To prevent Doom from prejudicially acting upon the interlopers, Stephen used his magic to teleport them away. Following the disappearance of the Cabal and the heroes from Earth-616, Doom confronted Strange for disobeying him, and ultimately killed him after Stephen accused him of being afraid of Richards.[8]\nThe following day, a funeral was held for Stephen Strange inDoomstadt, with the cause of his death kept a secret by Doom himself. Once the dusk had fallen, Doom tasked Valeria to use the resources of the Foundation to find the interlopers who had been scattered across the world, denying to provide any more information than that. Once Valeria left, Doom opened a portal below a Molecule Man statue in his garden, walking down a set of stairs to meet theMolecule Manand informed him of Strange's death. The Molecule Man made remembrance of the day when he, Doom and Strange confronted the Beyonders. During Doom's mission to thwart the Beyonders' plan by killing Molecule Men across the Multiverse, they had realized that it was not going to work; the Beyonders had built the Molecule Men too well and killing them early was still causing the Multiverse to die. Changing the plan, they began to capture the Molecule Men, and when they confronted the Beyonders, Doom unleashed the countless Molecule Men he had gathered to kill them; the Molecule Man acted as a conduit to steal the Beyonders' power and give it to Doom. The Molecule Man finished his chat with Doom by informing him that with Strange's death, he had most likely started an unraveling that could take everyone down.\nBack on Doomstadt, the Department of Science of the Foundation set out to find the interlopers. Jane Foster had infiltrated the Thor Corps, Black Panther and Namor found themselves inEgyptia, Captain Marvel had been captured by the forces ofBar Sinister, Black Swan had appeared in Doomstadt, Thanos was teleported to the other side of theShield,[9]and both Star-Lord and Miles Morales ended up in theKingdom of Manhattan.[10][11]\nThree weeks later, Battleworld was in disarray, with disorder having escalated into open rebellion in several kingdoms, with somebody called \"the Prophet\" forming an army against Doom, Victor would later order some of his most loyal Barons to deal with the threat of the Prophet. Of the interlopers only Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive had been captured, while Black Swan offered help to Doom. While the Foundation were investigating, they found the source of Doom's power, and informed Valeria, who had become suspicious of her father, of this.\nThe source of Doom's power\nSomewhere in Battleworld, the two Reed Richards teamed up and started trying to find a way to defeat Doctor Doom, with Earth-616's Reed being unwilling to kill him, unlike his Earth-1610 counterpart. The Reeds had also started investigating the source of Doom's power, for which they sent both of the Spider-Men, Peter and Miles, to infiltrate Castle Doom using a device to guide them to said source, located under a statue of the Molecule Man. The Spider-Men encountered Valeria, who chose not to go with them due to her worry that, she would be not be capable of facing what would happen if she found the truth behind her father. In order to make the Spider-Men deserving of Valeria keeping her mouth shut about their presence in the Castle, she demanded to know if any of the people in the raft had killed Strange, and Peter confirmed Valeria's suspicions, that nobody from the raft was responsible. After opening a trapdoor under the statue, the Spider-Men delve into its depths and come across the Molecule Man. Owen questioned them if they had brought him something to eat, and Miles gave him a burger he had had in his pocket. After satisfying his hunger, Owen reveals that he's the battery behind Doom's power, at the arachid hero's request to find the source of Emperor Doom's power.\nMeanwhile, Namor and Black Panther arrived to Strange's Hidden Isle of Agamotto, using the Key of Agamotto given to them by Strange, they entered, and after identifying themselves as member of the Illuminati to a projection of the deceased Sorcerer Supreme, they were given access to some powerful items Strange had collected over the years, including theSiege Courageousand anInfinity Gauntletthat worked only inDoomstadt.\nThanos, who had been captured by the Hel-Rangers, started talking to the sentient structure that formed the Shield, a giant alternate version ofthe Thing (Ben Grimm), and convinced him to reject Doom, and rise, causing the Shield to fall down.[12]\nRebelling against God Emperor Doom\nThe Prophet, who was revealed to be none other thanMaximus, marched his troops forward to Castle Doom, where some of the most powerful Barons held the line. But betrayal was present during the assault, and Baron Sinister took the chance to turn against his fellow Baroness theGoblin Queen. Sinister was subsequently struck down byBaron Apocalypse. The expected reinforcements in the form of the Thor Corps joined the battle, but fighting against Doom's side, as Jane Foster had managed to convince the fellow Thors to fight against their god.Baron Maestrosoon joined the battle with his army ofWorldbreakers.\nThe two Reed Richards continued to plot from the distance, and they planned to use the fight in the steps of Castle Doom to infiltrate the building and steal \"the most valuable thing that's left from the Multiverse\" from Doom. Black Panther and Namor traveled to the Deadlands for reinforcements, and Black Panther used his title as the King of the Dead to convince the zombies to join the forces opposing Doom.[13]\nWhile the battle in Doomstadt waged on, the two Reed Richards were transported by Star-Lord to Castle Doom. The Thing from the Shield joined the brawl, and easily destroyed anything in his way. Franklin von Doom opposed him using hisGalactus, and The Thing decided to surrender after learning the kid he was fighting was the son of Sue Storm. When God Emperor Doom joined the battle against the recently-arrivedAnnihilation Wave, Valeria convinced her mother to run away in order to show her something.\nAs the two Reeds looked for Doom's power source, Star-Lord remained behind repairing their ship, and he was confronted by Black Swan. The ensuing fight, during which Quill was easily overpowered, took the two of them to Doom's throne room, belowYggdrasill. Star-Lord used a splint of Groot on the magical tree, which engulfed it entirely, and turned Yggdrasill into a giant Groot that destroyed the castle from the inside out. Valeria and Sue witnessed the fall of their home from the castle gardener's, and they encountered the two Reeds trying to access to the Molecule Man's chamber.\nBack in the battlefield, Thanos unsuccessfully confronted Doom, and was easily killed. In the moment right after that, the Siege Courageous opened up and a horde of zombies came out. After the zombies, Namor and Black Panther, who had the Infinity Gauntlet, came out proclaiming this to be the end of Doom's reign.[14]\nDoom tried to convince T'Challa and Namor to stop fighting by promising them to rebuild Wakanda and Atlantis, but they refused the offer and struck Doom down. Victor quickly regenerated from his own corpse and after dealing an energy blast at T'Challa and Namor which only killed the latter, continued fighting.\nWhile Doom and Black Panther use their power against each other, Mister Fantastic and the Maker visited the Molecule Man. Owen once asked his visitors if they had brought him anything to eat, but they had not. The Maker quickly betrayed his counterpart and trapped him in a temporal bubble, claiming that he couldn't tolerate the kind of weakness Reed has shown. His plan is cut short as the Molecule Man sliced him and freed Mr. Fantastic.\nDoom and Reed's final struggle\nBlack Panther's battle against Doom came to an end after Victor crushed the Infinity Gauntlet. After subduing T'Challa, he realizes the fight had merely been a distraction. Doom quickly teleported to the Molecule Man's statue and delved into his chamber, and tried to destroy Richards with a snap of his fingers. He was surprised when his power did not work, and the Molecule Man asked him if he had brought him something to eat, to which Doom replied he did not. Thus, Owen claimed that Reed and Doom were in equal ground. Mister Fantastic and Doom engage in a furious combat, with Reed claiming that even though Victor did good, he could have done better, because he was too afraid of losing Battleworld he held it too tight. Doom accused Richards of believing he could have done better had he had Doom's power, and when Reed conceded he did, so did Doom. On the grounds that both agreed, the Molecule Man gave the power of the Beyonders to Reed, destroying Battleworld in the process. While the inhabitants were trying to outrun their imminent demise, Black Panther held tight to the Reality Gem of his Infinity Gauntlet as the world went white. When everything came back, T'Challa reappeared in the returned Marvel Universe.\nEight months later, Miles Morales appeared to be an inhabitant of the Marvel Universe instead of the destroyed Ultimate Universe. The young hero recalled when he and Peter Parker were leaving the Molecule Man's chamber in Battleworld, and Owen had stated he owed Miles one for the burger.\nRebirth of the Multiverse\nIn another side of the universe, the returnedFuture Foundationwas created and charting thereborn Multiverse. Reed Richards used the power of the Beyonders that the Molecule Man gave him to rebuilt realities with the help ofFranklin Richardsand the Molecule Man himself. Reed told Sue that he had learned that the difference between living and dying was managing fear, and not being so afraid of losing the things you loved that you held them too tight. Reed used to believe in entropy, but he now believed in expansion and resilience, in that everything lives.\nThe Marvel Universe is on the verge of destruction!What will our heroes do with their final hours before it all ends?Before a new chapter can begin, this one must end!\nThe Marvel Universe is no more!All that exists is a single titanic patchwork planet - BATTLEWORLD!The Secret Wars are waged across the fragments of hundreds of devastated universes during the explosive events of the core SECRET WARS series!\nThe MARVEL UNIVERSE is SECRET WARS!While the Secret Wars rage, the building blocks of a new Marvel Universe take form within the war-torn Domains that make up Battleworld!The future of Marvel begins here!\nAdditionally,Free Comic Book Dayfeatured a promotionalFree Comic Book Day 2015 (Secret Wars)#1comic as a prologue to kick off the event.

All of these realities are known as domains, and most have the ability to interact with each other.

The planet's chief scientist and creator of theSuper-Skrull, knew the planet was doomed. He devised a plan to ensure the safety of his newborn son. The scientist imbued his son with powers far greater than any previously seen in the Skrull race. The child was then placed inside a specially designed craft and set course for a new planet. Upon arrival the child would disguise itself as a native until it was deemed ready to conquer the planet.[4]\nThe craft landed inIowaone night and a couple witnessed its arrival. Upon inspection of the craft it opened, and the couple was amazed to see a child inside. They considered it a divine gift and decided to adopt him, unaware of his true nature. NamedEthanand raised on the farm, he had a strong moral upbringing. After realizing Ethan had incredible powers, his parents taught him the importance of keeping them a secret. Eventually once Ethan had become a young man he felt he had a greater purpose in life and so left the farm.[5]\nAfter moving toNew York, Ethan landed himself a job at theDaily Bugle, and was soon being referred to as their 'new star reporter' byJ. Jonah Jameson.Peter Parkerwas at the Bugle in time to be introduced to Ethan and was then teamed up with him for a feature on Spider-Man after landing himself a new full time position.[1]\nOn Peter's first day back, he and Ethan were taking a trip downtown when they spotted a man hanging from a window ledge. Peter quickly found a place to change into Spider-Man but the man fell from the window. He was caught in the air by a hero wearing a green cape. Inside the building Spider-Man tangled with theAbsorbing Man. The green caped hero reappeared and sent Creel halfway acrossManhattanwith a single blow.[6]\nThe two had a rendezvous atop a building, where the hero revealed himself to be Ethan and that he knew Spider-Man's identity. Ethan also revealed he wanted to use his powers for the good of mankind and Peter reluctantly agreed to be Ethan's superhero mentor.[5]\nWanting to discover the full extent of Ethan's powers and their origins, Spider-Man took his new friend to theBaxter Building. Following some tests by theFantastic Four, Ethan (now calling himself 'Virtue') proved to be in the same strength bracket asThe Thing, able to see in any light spectrum, and able to match theHuman Torch's speed and maneuverability in the air. Later that day Ethan's face was captured and broadcast on TV. Upon returning to the Bugle everyone knew who this new hero was and wanted his story.[4]\nPeter got a call fromMister Fantastic. Reed explained he and the FF had found the craft that brought Ethan to Earth. In Iowa near the site, the Fantastic Four were quizzing Ethan's father when Ethan arrived. The craft suddenly began to talk to Ethan in Skrull. He attacked the Fantastic Four before his father defused the situation. Ethan then flew away, but with his mind not right due to the mind mending on his mind.[4][7]\nBack in New York, Ethan was now seemingly operating on a new set of directives, again appearing as Spider-Man was investigating Absorbing Man and theOwl. Ethan destroyed the building, unknowingly killing an informant Spider-Man was looking for. Back at the Daily Bugle, Ethan researched who and what the Skrull are, coming to think he was a \"murderous Skrull\".[2]\nTrue form\nHe returned to the Baxter Building and demanded to see Reed Richards again. However, the Fantastic Four were still examining the craft back in Iowa. After smashing through the exterior of the building, theNew Avengers(who had been alerted by Spider-Man) arrived to try and stop him.[2]\nSeeing the events on TV,Aunt MayandJarvisarrived fromStark Tower. They managed to talk Ethan down by convincing him of the good he could do in the world by helping the needy. Following this advice Ethan moved overseas to help the less fortunate. He began to heal the sick and wounded. Hearing this from Parker puzzled Mister Fantastic; the craft did not mention any healing powers.[2]\nSimon Williams, Wonder Man, managed to convince some super heroes to  take part in his Anti-Avengers team called theRevengers, one of them was Virtue, who joined so he could avenge his people followingtheir failed invasion. The Revengers defeated theNew AvengersatAvengers Mansion, and later, they called a press conference at the court, where the Avengers appeared to confront them. After failing at discuss with Wonder Man,Iron Mantrapped him in his ionic form in a containment unit. Not willing to fight with too many civilians near,Thorteleported the Revengers to the City Field, where they where subdued by both the Avengers and the New Avengers and later imprisoned.[8][9]\nVirtue resurfaced years later as a member of theKree/Skrull allianceunder the leadership ofEmperor Hulkling. He was part of a crew led byTalosthat was investigating the cease in communications from a number worlds which had fallen to the path of destruction ofKnull, the god of theSymbiotes. When Talos' crew approached one of these worlds,Gnarrat, their ship was boarded and taken over by symbiotes. Virtue was one of the crewmates possessed by the invaders.[10]\nPossessed by a symbiote\nSkrull Shape-Shifting:like all Skrulls, Ethan was able to shapeshift.\nSkrull Engineering:"

TheIlluminatiassembled to deal with these incursions in secret, after they had captured aBlack Swan.[5]They reverse engineered the Black Swan'santimatter bombso they could destroy other incursion worlds, for an incursion can be stopped or prevented by destroying even just one of the Earths.[6]\nBuilder systems:Ex Nihilo, Aleph, and Abyss\nCaptain Universesensed that the universe was dying (a symptom of the incursions) and chose a \"broken\" host,Tamara Devoux, to reflect that.[7]Her first \"children,\" theBuilders, had created \"systems\" to help shape the universe. Three Builder creations—Ex Nihilo,Abyss, andAleph—forced theAvengersto expand after they had flung Origin Bombs to Earth from theirGardenonMars. The new Captain Universe, now an Avenger, ordered Ex Nihilo and Abyss to stop and she destroyed theirAleph.[8]\nBuilder systems:Nightmask and Starbrand, ascended by the White Event\nMeanwhile, the incursions caused awave of destructionacross theSuperflow, where the Builders had created structures and stations to fireWhite Events. The last of these stations fired their last White Events in desperation before they collapsed. OnEarth-616, this resulted in the ascension ofNightmask (Adam)(a creation of Ex Nihilo) andStarbrand (Kevin Connor). These were newer Builder systems compared to theGardeners.[9]\nStarbrand, Nightmask, Abyss, and Ex Nihilo as Avengers\nRecognizing Earth as the \"multiversal fracture point,\" some of the lifeforms from Ex Nihilo's Origin Bombs sent a signal to the Builders in space: \"System failure. Multiversal fracture point. World terminal.\"[10]The Builders soon began their aggression on the universe. Captain Universe noticed this and told the Avengers that they must get bigger. As per Captain Universe's suggestions, the Avengers recruited Builder systems Ex Nihilo, Abyss, Starbrand, and Nightmask.[11]\nThe Builders' World Killer destroying Galador on their way to Earth\nThe planetGaladorbecame one of the earliest victims of theBuilder Armadaduring theBuilders' campaign. Located 60,000 light years away formEarth, it faced ruthless attacks from the Builders' ground forces, the mechanical exterminators calledAlephs. Galador was not undefended and its heroes, theSpaceknights, fought bravely against the invaders. ACuratorand aCaretakerreported the resistance to their Builder masters, who simply replied that all worlds resist. AfterGaladorianchildrenSannoandKiruhad been saved by the Spaceknights,Captain Universeappeared and told the hopeful youths that it was not enough. The Builders arrived with theirWorld Killer; Sanno and Kiru embraced one last time as their planet was destroyed.[12]\n\nThe Avengers gathering to discuss the Builder threat\nAfter the attack on Galador, Captain Universe reappeared at thePeak, headquarters ofS.W.O.R.D, in a comatose state. S.W.O.R.D. had been busy dealing with a significant influx of potential alien invaders, who were actually nonviolent refugees, and had the Avengers help. Once the Avengers (includingEx Nihilo) were called in about the return of Captain Universe, they were also informed about aKreeopen channel distress signal, something they would never normally do. As they watched the footage of a doomed crew from a Kree moon being slaughtered by Alephs and Gardeners,Abigail Brandrevealed that the trajectory of the Builders' path of destruction was heading directly to Earth.[12]\nHours after the distress signal, S.W.O.R.D. picked up military chatter from almost all members and space empires of theGalactic Council.Smasher, a Superguardian of theShi'arImperial Guard, confirmed that she had been recalled and noted that the order included all Subguardians to be on standby, meaning heavy losses was expected. After Ex Nihilo andAbysshad confirmed that Earth alone stood no chance against the Builders, the Avengers decided to stand alongside the other worlds in space, thoughTony Starkstayed behind.[12]\nThe Galactic Council rallying together against the Builders\nAs the Builders continued to terrorize everything in their path, an assembly was called for war on the Citadel of theGalactic Council, located in the neutral territory of Nomad. Although the former greatSkrull Empirehad fractured into warring factions,Kl'rt the Super-Skrullmanaged to convince most of theSkrullwarlords to unite under him and presented himself to the Council for admittance. Among the council leaders wereGladiatorof theShi'ar Empire, theSupreme IntelligenceandRonan the Accuserof theKree Empire, andJ'sonof theSpartax Empire. Even historical enemies such as theBrood QueenandAnnihilusof theNegative Zonehad agreed to join forces for the Builder threat was bigger than them all.[13]\nRepresentatives from hundreds of thousands of worlds gathered, including the Avengers of Earth, but even with all of this, the Council did not believe they could challenge the Builder fleet in direct combat. The Super-Skrull showed the Council footage of the Skrull warlordDm'yr's victory against a small advance fleet by catching them by surprise, though at the cost of the Skrulls' lives. The Council decided to do a surprise attack of their own at the Corridor, which lay in the Builders' path.[13]\nThe Council ambushing the Builders at the Corridor\nThe alliedCouncil Armadahid among the dense circling asteroid belt of the singularity at the Corridor. The plan was to pin the Builder fleet between the black hole and the allied forces. After lying in wait for three days, they detected the enemy Builder fleet passing by and launched a massive ambush. In the midst of the intense fire fight, Ronan the Accuser alerted the allied armada that the Supreme Intelligence had deduced the identity of the Builders' command vessel, based on the observed movements. The Council Armada focused their attack on the ship and destroyed it.[13]\nThe Builders decimating the allied forces\nHowever, just as the allied worlds believed that they had won, the actual Builder fleet uncloaked themselves and completely overpowered the Council Armada in a sudden, decisive attack. Within just a minute, the Galactic Council lost a third of their entire fleet and was forced to retreat.Manifoldmanaged to teleport half of the Avengers out of the battlefield, but a ship containing the remaining Avengers was caught in the explosion of a destroyed Shi'ar cruiser. They were captured by the Builders.[14]\nScattered, the Shi'ar retreated to the rendezvous point, the agri-worldWhaan Prime. With the Avengers'Quincarrierdamaged beyond all repair, they boarded the Shi'ar flagship,Lilandra. Smasher noted that all communication networks went dark right after they had retreated. Meanwhile, Gladiator discussed next steps with his councillors but they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of four Builder crafts. Gladiator rallied the Shi'ar, and with help from the Avengers, they defeated the persuit fleet.[15]\nJerran Ko being ordered by the Builders to kill himself and poison Whaan Prime\nThe Shi'ar and Avengers watching the spoils of their first \"victory\"\nHowever, in defeat, anEx NihiliinamedJerran Koand hisAlephwent down to Whaan Prime, a harmless, helpless farming world. While happy to see a garden, Jerran Ko knew the task his creators ordered him to perform and asked his Aleph if it believed in the afterlife. Aleph revealed that it would live on in the code and reminded Jerran Ko to wound the enemy if defeated. Jerran Ko asked the Aleph to tell the others that the days when the Gardeners meant life were better and were now long gone. He commited suicide and poisoned the entire world of Whaan Prime. The Shi'ar and Avengers could only save a few lucky hundreds of thousands of refugees, while everyone else died from disease and decay. It was worse than just death.[15]\n100,000,000 refugees at the Behemoth to escape the Builders\nThe broken Galactic Council converged at the ringworldBehemoth, located in trans-galactic space. 100,000,000 refugees and counting were gathered there, having fled their home worlds to escape the Builders. Some of the rufugees came from plague worlds such as Whaam Prime, overloading the already stressed medical teams. Guilty for all the pain and suffering his creators had wrought, Ex Nihilo provided the ringworld with thousands of gardens and encouraged them to continuously yield food. Many refugees tended to these gardens to distract them from what they had lost.[16]\nDuring the Galactic War Council meeting, J'son and the Supreme Intelligence revealed the true strength of the Builder armada: 17,000 light cruisers, 3000 carriers, 2000 heavy cruisers, 600 worldships, and 12 World Killers. Furthermore, that was only the main fleet and there were smaller ones tearing through clusters at the edge of Council space. Outnumbered, outgunned, and outmatched, the Council debated whether or not to surrender and live or to fight to their almost certain deaths. When Gladiator noted their ignorance of their enemy,Captain Americaoffered the Council to see Ex Nihilo. However, Ex Nihilo was confused as much of what he saw in the war, especially Jerran Ko's suicide, went against everything he had been taught; he believed that there was something wrong. Nevertheless, Ex Nihilo provided the insight that the Builders were efficient, direct, and linear, and the Supreme Intelligence realized that the true target of the Builders was Earth.[16]\nMeanwhile, on the Builders' command vessel, the captured Avengers were visited byEx Nihila, the Builders' aide. Ex Nihila decided to bring theKree-humanhybridCaptain Marvelto her Builder masters, who explained to Carol that they were not destroyers by nature and in fact much of the universe was cultivated by them, either directly or through theirsystems. Among the captured Avengers were several of these systems:Starbrand,Nightmask, andAbyss, whom the Builders and theEx Nihiliiwere surprised to see as they had thought all theAbyssihad died out. Even more surprising was the still-comatoseCaptain Universeamong them, the Builders' Great Mother. The Builders' interrogation was interrupted by a messenger linking toJ'sonofSpartax.[16]\nThe Builders attacking the Behemoth\n40,000,000+ refugees dead in a single attack\nBehind the backs of the Council, J'son pleaded to the Builders for a truce and asked the Builders what they wanted. The Builders revealed that they simply want to perserve the universe, which could only be done by destroying the Earth. J'son offered to give the Builders Earth and end the war, but the Builders did not even see it as a war, only a cleansing. They thanked J'son for giving them the Council's location, as the signal was tracked. Realizing what he had done, J'son tried to warn the other Council members, but it was too late. The Builders sent two ships to crash into the ringworld, obliterating the sanctuary. Out of the 100,000,000 refugees escaping from now-dead worlds, over 40,000,000 died.[16][17]\nWorld after world, including Hala, surrendering to the Builders\nThe catastrophic loss at the Behemoth greatly diminished the hope in the universe. It was a message, and one that the Builders would repeat to all worlds in their path in the weeks that followed: \"You cannot run from us.\" \"There is no place in this universe you can hide.\"[17]\nIn a surprising turn, the Builders offered terms to the remaining resistant worlds. They may live, so long as they completely and utterly submitted to the Builders. Proud, ancient worlds decided to pick life and surrendered. TheCentauriansofCentauri-IVand theKymelliansofKymelliawere the first to bend the knee, and then a hundred more desperate worlds followed. When the Builder Armada closed in onHala, the Supreme Intelligence conceded that they could not win.[17]\nThe Council luring out the main Builder forces at Hala\nUpon Hala's surrender, Ronan the Accuser and his forces were recalled despite his wish to stay and fight. The Kree had represented a fourth of the remaining Council Armada, turning an already hopeless situation critical. The Spartax Empire also withdrew shortly after; before leaving the Behemoth ruins, J'son informed the remaining Council members and the Avengers that the Builders were keeping the Avengers lost from the Corridor battle as prisoners, which he knew from his failed negotiation with them. For the rest of the Council, Captain America devised a plan to defeat the Builders at Hala.[17]\nThe Council capturing a Builder World Killer and using it against the Builders\nThe following day, Ronan and the Kree fleet returned to Hala to publicly lay down arms in front of a single Builder. The Builders thought themselves as great teachers to humble entire empires with merely a single member. However, just as the ceremony finished, the Council fleet arrived at Hala to attack the Builder fleet gathered there. As Captain America expected, the Builders counterattacked; the Council fleet was merely a diversion and bait to lure away the bulk of the Builders' attack vessels, leaving behind only their command ship and their World Killers. The teleporting AvengerManifoldsent an elite team of Avengers and Shi'ar Imperial Guard members to take control of one of the World Killers and used it to fire against the others. Thor and the Skrulls soon captured another World Killer and caused massive damage to the Builders' fleet.[17]\nStarbrand signalling the Council's first major win against the Builders\nWith the World Killers turned against them and the command ship damaged to the point that it could not escape, the Builders bitterly called a retreat for the majority of their forces, except for their third wing. Before teleporting away, the Builders ordered Ex Nihila to scuttle the ship and join the third wing in battle, asked her to make her death \"mean something,\" and then abandoned her.[17]Manifold transported a rescue team to the Builders' main vessel and freed the captured Avengers. They were discovered by Ex Nihila, but instead of attacking them, she decided to turn away and left them alone.[18]The now-freedStarbrand, who had accidentally gotten hispowerfrom a defectiveWhite Event, resolved to use the Brand's power and destroyed the leftover Builder forces. For the first time ever, the Council defeated and scattered the Builder armada.[17]\nThanks to intel gathered by the Shi'ar, the Council learned that the Builders had lost all of their World Killers in the recent attack, meaning they could no longer destroy planets on a whim. However, the Council only had half of their fleet remaining. The Brood Queen birthed many newBrooddrones to serve. Meanwhile, Annihilus gathered a newAnnihation WaveandMentorconfirmed to Gladiator that they could convert threeStargatesto access theNegative Zone. Captain America suggested to use the recent victory to talk to the Builders.[18]\nOn Hala, the sole Builder emissary stayed as he knew the Builder loss was only temporary. To prove it to the Accuser Ronan, he asked the Supreme Intelligence to calculate the chances of Builder victory against the Council armada, which was 83.2%, and the chances of the Builders retaining control over the Kree Empire, which was 70.1%. The lone Builder declared Hala his. Soon after, he received a message from Gladiator to discuss a parley. The Council seemingly agreed to surrender to the Builders.[18]\nThor killing a Builder in front of the universe\nThe Kree Empire rejoining the war against the Builders\nAfter the emissary had discussed with his fellow Builders, the Builders agreed to drop their interference on the communication networks so they could broadcast the surrender to the universe. The Builder on Hala ordered Ronan to gather all Kree of any political, societal, and militiary importance to witness \"the finest day in the history of the Kree Empire.\" When the Council diplomat,Thor, arrived, he threwMjolnirto the heavens to appear unarmed. The universe watched as Thor knelt before the Builder, who agreed to spare all worlds except for Earth; however, the universe also watched as Thor recalled his mighty hammer and slayed the Builder in front of him. Before dying, the Builder warned that their resistance would result ineverything dying. Thor and Ronan rallied the Accuser Corps and the liberated Kree Empire rejoined the war.[4]\nThe Council fighting back against the Builders\nAgainst the will of the Supreme Intelligence, who knew that the Council was still outmatched and preferred to survive by remaining subservient to the Builders, Ronan led the Kree Empire's armies into battle once more. Ronan's Accusers launched a surprise attack onKymellia III, destroying the Alephs there and freeing theKymellians, who rejoined the war. Meanwhile, the survivingSpaceknightsfromGaladorhelped liberateCentauri IVfrom the Builders, and the Skrull warlords managed to saveKorm Primebut with a heavy cost to themselves. However, none of them paid as heavily as the Shi'ar.[19]\nThe Council unleashing the Annihilation Wave\nA Builder extinguishing the Council's last hope\nThe Shi'ar forces and the Avengers fought alongside each other at the hottest battlefields:Rigel,Formuhaut, andChize. Across all of them, they suffered heavy casualties; Formuhaut was a stalemate but they were not going to hold, and they lost the battle for Chize. Despite the successive outbreaks of victory, the Council was losing momentum and it became apparent that they were still going to lose. As one last resort, they reluctantly opened a portal to theNegative Zonevia aStargateand unleashed theAnnihilation Wave, which hadravaged the universepreviously.Annihiluscommanded his drones to kill all Builders, but a Builder noted the simple hive-mind nature of the drones and manipulated them into wiping each other out. With the Annihilation Wave decimated, the Council ran out of options and Gladiator prepared to meet his end head-on, barring some unforeseen miracle.[19]\nAbyss and Ex Nihilo finding the other Gardeners, who have left the Builders\nBack whenAbysswas freed during thebattle at HalaandEx Nihiladecided to abandon her post, Ex Nihila telepathically communicated with last Abyss: \"Come find us.\" Abyss had informed her brotherEx Nihiloof this when they reunited and they ventured away from Builder War to find Ex Nihila. Abyss' psychic link to Ex Nihila enabled them to track her to a faraway planet where they were greeted by theGardeners, who had left their Builder masters.[18]\nAbyss and the Ex Nihilii restoring Captain Universe\nThe Gardeners gathered around the last Abyss and explained to Ex Nihilo that all of theirAbyssihad died and the Builders had recalled them following the creation of thenewuniversal superstructure. In turn, Ex Nihilo revealed that he did not stop creating life, making it apparent that the Abyssi's deaths were tied to the Ex Nihilii being forbidden from creating life-giving gardens, their entire purpose of existing. No longer willing to be expendable servants for the Builders at best, or killers of worlds at worst, Abyss and the Ex Nihilii banded together and restored Captain Universe, bringing forth a miracle.[20]\nFinally awake from her comatose state, Captain Universe boarded the Builders' command vessel and asked her first children why and when did death become their way, as they had always revered life before. The Builders explained that all universes in theMultiversewere dying (from theincursions) and the only way to stop this was to destroy the \"axis point\" that wasEarth. Still, Captain Universe would not let her children do that and killed one of the Builders, who did not believe that she was going to stop them. The other Builders retaliated and she was forced to kill the rest of them. One Builder survived and departedEarth-616to another universe. Before doing so, he activated the \"black band command\" to have theAlephsdestroy everything.[19]\nIncursion between Earth-616 and Earth-13131\nBack onEarth, anotherincursionstarted where the Earths ofReality-616andReality-13131began to collide, threatening to destroy both realities unless one of the Earths was destroyed. With the Avengers off fighting the Builders in space, Earth had been under attack by the Mad TitanThanosand his army, including theBlack Order, but the threat of the incursion was far greater than any of that. TheIlluminatiassembled once more to the site of the incursion: theTwelve Apostles,Australia.[17]\nAs the Illuminati discussed destroying the other Earth, a seemingly friendly Aleph suddenly appeared from the other universe and requested them to come with it. They arrived at theWorld Killerof the other universe where they met that universe's Builders, as well as its peculiarly red Ex Nihilii, one of whom extractedEbony Maw'sMind WebfromDoctor Strange's head. The Illuminati learned that the Builders used to freely travel across theMultiversethrough theSuperflow, the space between universes, but the incursions collapsed it and the Builders pledged to stop the end of everything.[21]\nThe Builders of Earth-13131 destroying their Earth to stop the incursion\nThe other universe's Builders informed the Illuminati that the local Builders of Earth-616 had been defeated. They knew this from a captured Builder, who was actually the same Builder who withdrew from Earth-616 to escape Captain Universe; he had landed in this universe due to its extreme proximity as the result of the incursion. Before sending the Illuminati home to their universe, the Builders revealed that they planned to destroy all Earths to preserve theMultiverse, but their World Killers were too big to travel through the incursion point, so they urged the Illuminati to destroy their own Earth. When the Illuminati returned home, they watched as the Builders' World Killer destroyed the other Earth, ending the incursion.[21]\nDockrum VII declaring itself an Avengers World\nWith the Builders gone, the World Killers destroyed or captured, and the Ex Nihilii defected, only the Alephs remained of the Builders' once-great military. Inspired by the Avengers and the public slaying of a Builder at Hala, the rest of the universe rebelled against the Builders' leftover forces. Once the Avengers and Shi'ar helped liberate the planetDockrum VII, its grateful people decided to erect a giant \"A\" symbol as a monument to their saviors. Before Captain America could protest, Oracle of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard reminded him that the Galactic Council by itself fell apart; every victory they had against the Builders to turn the tide was thanks to the Avengers and Captain America's strategies. Dockrum VII was free and was now an Avengers World.[22]\nBuilder-controlled worlds becoming Avenger Worlds\nWorld after world raised the Avengers banner as they retook the universe from the Builders' Alephs, and at the end, they were all Avenger Worlds. However, the Council's great celebration was cut short when Gladiator got word from the reestablished universal communication network that Earth had fallen under attack by the ruthless Thanos. To repay the Avengers for defeating the Builders, the Galactic Council was more than willing to devote a portion of their armada to reclaim Earth from the Mad Titan.[22]\nThe Council offered what they could spare, tookTitan, and made their way to Earth, but Thanos' fleet was greater than anticipated while the Council's fleet was extremely battle weary from the Builder War. Furthermore, Thanos' forces controlled the formidable defense station known as thePeak. Gladiator, Ronan, Super-Skrull, and Annihilus personally helped the war heroes take back the Peak, Ronan executedBlack Dwarfof theBlack Order, and the Council fleet broke through the enemy barricade, enabling the Avengers to go save their own world.[23]\nThe Gardeners healing the universe devastated by the Builder War\nIn the aftermath of the Builder War, theGardenersgathered aroundWhaan Primeto mournJerran Ko. Newly reformed, they went around the universe to rejuvenate the worlds ravaged by the Builders and returned to their original purpose as a force of life. Elsewhere, the Galactic Council went back to their worlds; Gladiator expanded the Imperial Guard and the Skrull Empire was united once more, with Kl'rt being crowned emperor. However, Annihilus captured the Stargatesfrom the warthat linked to the Negative Zone and turnedPraxis-2into Annihilation World.[25]\nBlack Swan warning that there are threats greater than the Builders involved in the incursions\nMeanwhile, after Thanos' defeat on Earth, theIlluminatireturned to their capturedBlack Swan, who offered them her counsel. Thanks to herincursionsensor, she knew about the recent incursion and laughed at the Builder involvement. As the Builders wereone of the factionsin the incursions, she possessed great knowledge of them. The Black Swan revealed that the Builders were hindered by the collapse of theSuperflow, which was why it took them so long to get to Earth in the Builder War. To the Black Swan, the Builders were just dogs and there were even greater threats, such as theMapmakersand theBlack Priests. Worse was coming.[24]\n\nWhen theAvengersdepartedEarthin order to face theBuilders, an ancient and powerful race with the objective of destroying Earth,Thanosand hisBlack Ordertook advantage of the absence of Earth's Mightiest Heroes from the planet in order to raze it.[12]\nThanos' army invaded Earth, and the Black Order confronted theIlluminati, as one of Thanos's minions had gathered the information they had on the Infinity Gems. Black Panther managed to forceBlack Dwarfto withdraw, while Doctor Strange was embarked in a mental fight againstEbony Maw. Beast and the X-Men foughtCorvus GlaiveandSupergiant.Proxima Midnightconfronted Namor in the ruins of an Atlantis where its inhabitants were annihilated by an attack from Wakanda, part of a conflict caused by Namor's attack on Wakanda during theconflict between the Avengers and the X-Men. However, the Black Order left their different locations as soon as they discovered the Illuminati didn't have the Infinity Gems.Black Boltwas visited by Glaive in order to demand a tribute, the heads of Inhuman younglings between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two, or face the annihilation of Earth's inhabitants. Meanwhile, the Avengers allied themselves with theGalactic Counciland their first battle against the Builders proved a disaster, as numerous Avengers were captured in the process. Back on Earth, Black Bolt used theInhuman Codexto discover Thanos used the tribute demand as a cover for his true mission, to kill his secret Inhuman-descendant son whose identity and location were unknown even to his father.[15]\nWhen the Illuminati headed to numerous locations around the world whereThanos' sonmight have been, Doctor Strange found the boy in a secret Inhuman town in Greenland. But as he had been under the influence of Ebony Maw, Maw remained in the location and forced Strange to forget about the discovery, and to leave, now freed from Maw's control.[26]In Attilan, Black Bolt is confronted byThanoshimself, and the Inhuman city is destroyed during the battle. During the destruction of Attilan, Black Bolt took the opportunity to activate an Inhuman Bomb which spread theTerrigen Mistsupon the entire face of Earth.[17]As millions of Inhuman descendants suffer from Terrigenesis across Earth, including Thanos' son,Thane, Thanos defeated Black Bolt in combat in the ruins of Attilan.[4]\nAfter the Avengers won theBuilder War, theGalactic Councilinformed the Avengers that Earth had fallen to Thanos' invasion. In Greenland,  Maw posed as an ally and offeredThanea suit to control his powers, but also captured him in a containment field, followed by Maw alerting Thanos about the discovery of his descendant. Thanos and the rest of the Black Order arrived toWakanda, followingNamor's declaration that the Infinity Gems were there when he was forced to surrender by Proxima Midnight, and found inNecropolisthe Illuminati's hidden headquarters, along with theantimatter bombs, which they planned to use to destroy Earth by activating them using Black Bolt. After the Black Order exceptSupergiantdeparted Wakanda to go to Greenland, the Illuminati arrived with the help ofMaximusandLockjawand started fighting back Thanos' army. Meanwhile, the Avengers and their numerous allies begun approaching Earth.[22]\nAfter breaking thrown the barrier settled by Thanos' army around Earth with the help of the Galactic Council, the Avengers managed to arrive to Thanos' location and fight him and what was left of hisBlack Orderand freeThane, the son of Thanos, who his father had captured. When the Illuminati arrived to Necropolis and the room where the antimatter bombs were, they found themselves against Thanos' generalSupergiant, who defeated them by mentally controlling Black Bolt. When Supergiant activated the bombs,Maximusappeared with the trigger. He triggered the bombs, but also usedLockjawto transport the antimatter bomb along with Supergiant to a distant uninhabited planet where she died in the explosion. Back in the battle of the Avengers against Thanos, Ebony Maw double-crossed the Mad Titan and freed Thane to let him fight his father. Thanos, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive's glaive were trapped by Thane in an amber construct which left them in a state of \"living death.\"[25]"

He is aNihilistobsessed with extending his own lifespan and will destroy any being that threatens his existence.[5]\nLong ago in theNegative Zone, when theTyannansseeded life spores on barren planets, one of their ships crash landed onto the volcanic planetArthroswhen it got hit by a meteor. Before dying, the crew released spores. Many years later, one of the spores evolved into an insectoid creature. Due to a mutation, he had a high intelligence.[6]\nFinding the wreckage of the Tyannan starship, he used a special helmet to transfer all information about the advanced Tyannan technology to himself. This caused him to grow stronger and smarter, gaining aCosmic Control Rodand body armaments. The creature eventually became known as Annihilus and he set out to destroy anything that was a threat to his existence. He planned to conquer or destroy all planets nearby Arthros.[6]\nAnnihilus feared only one thing: death. Because his Cosmic Control Rod extended his lifespan, he defended it from every potential threat, real or imagined. His first impression of theFantastic Four, then, was not favorable: they took away his rod to treatSusan Richardsduring her pregnancy, although they returned it when they were through with it.[4]\nIn one of his first conquests, Annihilus invadedSub-Atomica.Psycho-Mantried to fight back with weapons that tapped the powers of theSilver SurferandSpider-Man. After the two heroes escaped, though, Psycho-Man somehow drove back Annihilus' army successfully.[8]\nHis next contact with Earth was throughNega-Man(evil twin of Janus), who discovered how to draw power from the Negative Zone. Annihilus defeated him with ease, but spared his life in exchange for his help in invading Earth. Nega-Man later betrayed him and apparently died in the Exploding Atmosphere, the point of contact between the two universes. The male members of the Fantastic Four ventured into the Zone to stop Janus, and battled Annihilus until Janus' apparent death made that fight unnecessary to continue. The Thing and the Human Torch managed to return to Earth safely with Reed distracting Annihilus. However, as Reed lost his own tracking device in the struggle to enable himself to return, Reed decided to sacrifice himself with a deliberate drift into the Exploding Atmosphere to keep his knowledge safe from Annihilus. However back on Earth,Agatha Harknesshelped the rest of the Four with her magic to rescue Reed with a fiery beacon indicating the way out and a mass illusion to confuse Annihilus enough for Reed to exit safely.[9]\nA temporary inhabitant of the Negative Zone because of theNega-Bands,Rick JonesdrewCaptain Marvelthere to free him. Seeing another opportunity to invade Earth, Annihilus tried to follow them but was driven back by theAvengers.[10]Jones soon returned, and Annihilus took him prisoner. This time, Annihilus faced theKreeand theSkrulls, who were at war, as well as the Avengers. Jones managed to tap into the Destiny Force, which let him escape and end the war.[11]\nAlways searching for new sources of energy, Annihilus kidnappedFranklin Richards, the same child he indirectly saved earlier. Franklin's psionic abilities quickly spiraled out of control, andReed Richardswas forced to shut them down.[12]\nIn Annihilus' next encounter with Reed, they became allies. Annihilus had found Scavenger, an android created by theMad Thinker, and put it to work. Once the Mad Thinker re-established control over the android, though, it stole the Cosmic Control Rod for a power source. Reed, cast into the Negative Zone by theBrute(his evil twin), was forced to buy Annihilus' help by recovering the rod. Together they thwarted the Mad Thinker and the Brute.[13]\nAnnihilus found another android,A.I.M.'sSuper-Adaptoid, and hatched a new plan to conquer Earth. He formed an uneasy alliance withBlastaar, no doubt planning to double-cross him at the first opportunity. Instead, Blastaar's wife, Nyglar, double-crossed him and alerted the Avengers, who defeated the Super-Adaptoid, and, as a result, Annihilus killed Nyglar. In retaliation, Blastaar took the Cosmic Control Rod. Annihilus made his way to Earth, took Franklin and his governessAgatha Harknesshostage, and forced the FF to get his rod back.[14]\nShortly thereafter, Annihilus visited Earth again when the Fantastic Four took an extended trip into the Negative Zone. He took over theBaxter Buildingas a beachhead for invading Earth. After placing a force field around the building and terrorizing Franklin and Harkness, Annihilus was beaten by the FF and the Avengers.[15][16]\nMeanwhile,the realm of Asgardhad broken loose from its accustomed place and intersected the Negative Zone. When Annihilus learned of this new territory, he decided to conquer it. He bested the Asgardian soldiers and evenThorbefore losing toOdin.[17]Soon afterward, Annihilus kidnapped a sleeping Odin but lost a rematch with Thor.[18]\nNext, Annihilus encountered the long-lost Tyannans. Unfortunately, they were under the control of the Brute. Along with Blastaar and Reed Richards, Annihilus defeated the Brute and freed the Tyannans. To protect themselves from the other inhabitants of the Negative Zone, however, the Tyannans and Reed set up a barrier around their world.[19]\nAnother power-hungry madman,Syphonn, gained prominence in the Negative Zone. He had created a Conqueror Wheel, a device that allowed easy passage to the positive matter universe. Forming an alliance with Blastaar and Syphonn, Annihilus gathered his forces unaware that Syphon planned to betray him by destroying the positive matter universe and using its energy to become a god rather than opening a passage to enable an invasion. Before they could 'attack', though,Adam Warlockdestroyed the Conqueror Wheel.[20]\nNega-Man reappeared (the original Janus this time) as a member of the Gideon Trust, a group that used the FF's \"Transceptor\" technology to invade the Negative Zone and mine its resources. This constant traffic between the universes threatened to destroy the barrier between them. The loss of energy also weakened Annihilus. When Annihilus caught up to the Gideon Trust, however, he also encounteredHellscoutand the FF. Although the Gideon Trust obtained Annihilus's rod, Hellscout shattered it with a gunshot. Annihilus tried to recapture the fragments but was beheaded by Hellscout.[21]\nMuch later, insectoid larvae grew out of the rod fragments. A new, younger Annihilus appeared and menaced the Fantastic Four when they tried to set up a prison in the Negative Zone. They escaped when another Annihilus appeared and the two accused each other of stealing their rods.[22]\nMost recently, Annihilus discovered the Opposing Force, the Negative Zone's counterpart of thePower Cosmic. After long years of failed conquests, he had the power to fulfill his dreams. With an entity namedRavenouswho wielded this power, he invaded the positive matter universe through a portal known as theCrunch.Many worlds and many heroes fell before theAnnihilation Wave.[23]One of his goals was to master the Power Cosmic, so he captured several ofGalactus'heralds(all of whom have that power).[24]He also allied himself withThanosto take Galactus prisoner and use Galactus' power to destroy all life in the Negative Zone and the positive matter universe.\nKilled byNova\nAt the last moment,Drax the Destroyerfreed the Silver Surfer, who freed Galactus, who destroyed the Annihilation Wave, with Galactus, the Silver Surfer,Nova,Phyla-Vell, andStar-Lord, and the surviving Annihilus the only beings still alive in the area. Nova then had a final battle against Annihilus in which he succeeded in killing him, by shoving his fist down his throat and ripping out his internal organs. However, Annihilus was reborn on Kree-Lar, former capital of the Kree Empire and current seat of the territories ceded to the Annihilation Wave, by one of Annihilus' Queens.[7]\nThe consequences of this war were felt for years, while Annihilus bided his time to return to power. While the regent of the seceded territories Ravenous dealt with aPhalanx invasion, Annihilus grew safely in the Negative Zone. During theconflict between the Kree and Shi'ar, agroup of Shi'ar Raptorsdiscovered that the regent, a Bug king namedCatastrophus, was using the Cosmic Control Rod to retard the growth of the prime Annihilus. They stopped the process and killed Catastrophus, but warned the semi-sentient creature to remember their mercy.[25]\nAn enslaved Annihilus with theHuman Torchand theLight Brigade\nTheCult of the Negative Zonemade their way into the Baxter Building and breached the portal to the Negative Zone. Once inside, the cult managed to unleash what seemed to be an endless army of AnnihilusInsectoid SoldiersuponJohnny, the currently powerlessBen, and the kids of theFuture Foundation.Franklinrevealed that he had his powers back by destroying the army and the group pushed into theNegative Zone, where the only way to hold the army off from getting through the door was to lock the door from their side and randomize the code so no one could get in or out. Ben was prepared to make the sacrifice, but Johnny threw him through the portal as he regained his powers. Johnny used his nova flame, but still couldn't burn the whole army and was captured. Annihilus demanded that Johnny opened the portal to Earth, but he refused and was killed.[26]\nThree times Johnny was resurrected by worm-healers, but every time he burned them before they had time to recover his body and he died again and again. Finally the worms were able to recover his body, and Johnny was sent to prison, where he met with theLight Brigade. Together they escaped and attacked Annihilus, while Johnny took away hisCosmic Control Rod. After that Johnny opened a portal to the Baxter Building and they all returned toEarth.[26]\nJohnny used the Annihilation Wave ships to battle the Kree's (who were attacking the Earth at that time) until the Inhumans asked him to take down the Kree by their own. While the other heroes on Earth were dealing with the scraps of the battle which could damage the Earth, Reed and Sue summoned Galactus, who completely destroyed the Kree army. At that moment, the Mad Celestials appeared to destroy this universe.[27]\nWith the abdication of the Human Torch,[28]who still retained the Cosmic Control Rod,[29]Annihilus rebuilt his power base and joined theGalactic Council.[30]\nAnnihilus was summoned by Doctor Doom andKid Immortuswho promised Annihilus to retrieve the Cosmic Control Rod so he could join their alliance.[31]They began observing theFF, while Kid Immortus pressured into merging themselves together so they could defeat the Fantastic Four, but Doom remained unconvinced. They forcedAlex Powerto sabotage the FF's portal so the superheroes would wound up in Doom's nation ofLatveria,[32]it instead transported them on the moon, due toAnt-Manbeing aware of their plans with the help ofImpossible Manredirected the portal.[33]When the FF began preparing their attack on Latveria, Doom was able to retrieve the Cosmic Control Rod with the assistance of hisCouncil of Doom.[33]However, when the FF came, Doom refused to merge with Immortus and Annihilus, deeming them inferior, and instead absorbed the rod into himself and incapacitated Immortus, Annihilus and the FF.[34]Ultimately, the FF defeated Doom and Annihilus got his Cosmic Control Rod back.[35]\nVs.Hulk\nWanting to invade the Posiverse once again but needing greater power, Annihilus, withPip the Troll's help, captured theHulkand took him to the Negative Zone.[36]Annihilus ordered his servant Doctor Bultar (actually the demonMephistoin disguise) to discover what caused Banner to bulk up when he transformed into the Hulk.[37]The Mad Titan Thanos tried to stop Annihilus, but Annihilus was successful in copying Hulk's transformation and growing into a giant.[38]Annihilus and Hulk did battle with Annihilus gaining the advantage, but Hulk was unexpectedly rescued by Pip the Troll and managed to return to Earth.[39]\nWith his newfound strength along with new teleportation technology, Annihilus attacked the Posiverse in search of a great power source that had recently appeared. Annihilus eventually discovered that the new power source was anAdam Warlockfroman alternate reality. Before entering the universe ofEarth-616, Warlock had absorbed the entirety of his home reality, turning him into one of the most powerful entities in the universe. Annihilus was opposed by Warlock, Thanos, theGuardians of the Galaxy,Gladiatorof theShi'ar, and Pip the Troll. Thanks to his increased power and the power to instill fear into others, Annihilus was able to defeat his enemies and capture Warlock.[40]\nAs Annihilus used Warlock's power to destroy the Posiverse, Pip the Troll woke Warlock up and accidentally caused Warlock to destroy the universe with his power. Annihilus was later brought back to life when the universe was restored as result of a deal between Warlock and theAbove-All-Others. With the universe restored to the point before his invasion, Annihilus and his forces were defeated by an army of the dead led by Warlock and Thanos. Annihilus was subsequently killed by Thanos, who stepped on him after Warlock devolved him into a small, harmless bug.[41]\nConqueringPraxis-2\nWith the coming of the Builders, a resurrected Annihilus used the modified Shi'ar stargates overPraxis-2to bring another Annihilation Wave, despite confirming that he would be unable to control it without his Rod. However, the Builders were able to use their mastery of xenobiology to hack into the hivemind of the Wave and tell them to devour themselves. After the defeat of the Builders, Annihilus retained control of the Stargates and turned Praxis-2 into his foothold in Earth-616. The planet was dubbed Annihilation World, and was the bridge into the Negative Zone.[42]\nAfter finding out thatthe decay of the universewas linked to Earth, theShi'ar Empiredecided to destroy it. The heroes of Earth tried to stop them using theirPlanetkiller, but Annihilus, who had allied himself with the Shi'ar, commanded his Annihilation Wave to destroy the machine. They were about to destroy Earth when Iron Man used theSol's Hammerto destroy the entire Shi'ar fleet.[43]\nEnslaving theAvengers\nAnnihilus eventually set a trap on an unnamed planet, luring ships, shooting them down, and capturing them in order to claim new potential soldiers. The trap eventually lured the Avengers who were also captured by Annihilus's forces. He tried to subdue the Avengers youngest members, but they were able to fend off Annihilus and along with the other prisoners escaped the Negative Zone; however, leavingSpider-Manbehind.[44]Unwilling to leave their teammate behind, the heroes began using the Nega-Bands to switch each other's places between their universe and the Negative Zone and eventually they were able to destroy Annihilus' weapon.[45]\nWanting to take control over the universe, Annihilus and theQueen of the Broodmanipulated Thanos into attacking the Earth, in order for them to raze the planet. However, theGuardians of the Galaxyprevented that, leading Annihilus to abandon his goal.[46]\nAnnihilus had stolen some of theHigh Evolutionary's animals, includingLockjaw's brother. Through torture, Annihilus was able unlock the dog's teleportation powers and hoping to use this power to take over theMultiverse, he set out to capture all ot the other siblings. Thankfully,LockjawandD-Manwere able to defeat Annihilus, after teletransporting through different dimension, leaving Annihilus to be eaten by a shark.[47]\nUnited against the Scourge\nWhen the Negative Zone was attacked by the forces of theCancerverseled by the\"Sentry\", Annihilus formed a truce with Blastaar in order to fight the Scourge; however, they were outnumbered, leaving Annihilus to open a crack in reality in order to escape and seek help.[48]\nIn the hopes of getting help from theNova Corps, Annihilus sought Nova only to find out that he was the only surviving member. They went to the Fantastic Four's base in order to use their portal access to the Negative Zone. They ended up on a moon of planet Ollrig, whose people chose to kill themselves than fall to the forces of the Cancerverse. Rider and Annihilus found a few of Ollrig's survivors and stayed with them for a few hours. While Nova fought off the Negative Zone beings possessed by the Scourge, he left to the Posiverse after being confronted by the Sentry, leaving Annihilus and the survivors to find a new place to hide.[49]\nQuantum Bands:During the Annihilation Wave assault, Annihilus managed to killQuasarand claimed his Quantum Bands for himself.[56]With them he managed to double his already considerably high power levels. He could challenge and withstand the combined assault of theUnited Frontbacked by a Nova Force empowered Rich Rider, theSilver Surferand his masterGalactusthe world devourer. Enabling him to survive a galaxian blast that shattered both his Annihilation Wave army and several star systems relatively unscathed.[7]"

Its last protector was the King ofAsgard,Thor. Out of nostalgia, he wished for theMidgardof old and was the only one who had interest in the planet until the Devourer of Worlds himself, Galactus, arrived to complete the one thing he never accomplished: to satiate his hunger for Earth.[1]\nAs Galactus began to drill into the planet to absorb its life energy, King Thor and his grand-daughters looked on with a sense of awe as Galactus hadn't been seen in centuries. Thor decided to take on the creature himself against his grand-daughters wishes so he opened up a portal withMjolnirto send them back to Asgard for their safety. As Thor confronted Galactus, he did not heed to Thor's words and told the Thunder God that it was Earth's time to die, and that he may die along with it. Thor immediately attacked Galactus with a mighty blow from his hammer but ended up being counteracted by a powerful blast of thePower Cosmic.[2]\nPower Cosmicvs.Thor-Force\nGalactus gained the upper when he bombarded Thor with a massive dose of his power, causing Thor to be shot into space. Thor then gathered up all of theThor-Forcewithin him and flew back at top speed to strike at Galactus while the latter fired another powerful burst of the Power Cosmic. As they both collided, they ended up cancelling each other's abilities out, but a tiring Thor got hit with a final blast by Galactus which ended in his apparent death, leaving the Devourer to finish off the Earth.[3]With King Thor hurled into outer spacehis three granddaughtersreturned to Earth to fight Galactus using ancient weapons. They held their own for a while until Galactus tired and created a massive explosion.[4]\nWhen he was ready to finally devour Earth and kill the Godesses of Thunder, Galactus was attacked by King Thor, who returned from deep space withAll-Black the Necrosword, and was brutally defeated by him.[5]After their battle, King Thor gave Galactus leave to consumeMarsand while Galactus was devouring it, the black blade, that Galactus believed to be destroyed, manifested itself inside the Devourer of Worlds, turning him into the Butcher of Worlds.[6]\nBeing eaten by Ego\nSome time later, after devouring countless worlds, the Butcher of Worlds was devoured byEgo the Living Planet, who absorbed All-Black the Necrosword into himself after being impaled by it.[7]"

Its last protector was the King ofAsgard,Thor. Out of nostalgia, he wished for theMidgardof old and was the only one who had interest in the planet until the Devourer of Worlds himself, Galactus, arrived to complete the one thing he never accomplished: to satiate his hunger for Earth.[1]\nAs Galactus began to drill into the planet to absorb its life energy, King Thor and his grand-daughters looked on with a sense of awe as Galactus hadn't been seen in centuries. Thor decided to take on the creature himself against his grand-daughters wishes so he opened up a portal withMjolnirto send them back to Asgard for their safety. As Thor confronted Galactus, he did not heed to Thor's words and told the Thunder God that it was Earth's time to die, and that he may die along with it. Thor immediately attacked Galactus with a mighty blow from his hammer but ended up being counteracted by a powerful blast of thePower Cosmic.[2]\nPower Cosmicvs.Thor-Force\nGalactus gained the upper when he bombarded Thor with a massive dose of his power, causing Thor to be shot into space. Thor then gathered up all of theThor-Forcewithin him and flew back at top speed to strike at Galactus while the latter fired another powerful burst of the Power Cosmic. As they both collided, they ended up cancelling each other's abilities out, but a tiring Thor got hit with a final blast by Galactus which ended in his apparent death, leaving the Devourer to finish off the Earth.[3]With King Thor hurled into outer spacehis three granddaughtersreturned to Earth to fight Galactus using ancient weapons. They held their own for a while until Galactus tired and created a massive explosion.[4]\nWhen he was ready to finally devour Earth and kill the Godesses of Thunder, Galactus was attacked by King Thor, who returned from deep space withAll-Black the Necrosword, and was brutally defeated by him.[5]After their battle, King Thor gave Galactus leave to consumeMarsand while Galactus was devouring it, the black blade, that Galactus believed to be destroyed, manifested itself inside the Devourer of Worlds, turning him into the Butcher of Worlds.[6]\nBeing eaten by Ego\nSome time later, after devouring countless worlds, the Butcher of Worlds was devoured byEgo the Living Planet, who absorbed All-Black the Necrosword into himself after being impaled by it.[7]"

The Fraternity of Raptors protects the long term interests of theShi'ar Empirein a mission they call \"The Great Purpose.\" The Raptors armor make use of a stream of information called theDatasongwhich provides them with information about past and future events.[citation needed]\nEventually, the Fraternity grew too powerful and each member was sealed in patches of dark matter throughout Shi'ar territory. After theSkrull secret invasion, several Raptors were freed. They continued their mission and destroyed anyone who stood in their way.[citation needed]\nTalonandRazorwere successful in assassinatingEmpress Lilandraof the Shi'ar Empire.Darkhawk (Chris Powell)eventually defeated Razor and Talon and both were banished toNull Space. TheSphinxlater arranged for Darkhawk to fight a third member of the Raptors named Gyre who Darkhawk also defeated and banished to Null Space. Talon later returned and convinced Mentor and Plutonia of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard to become raptors using two amulets.MentorbecameStrelandPlutoniabecameKyte. Talon was last seen posing as the Shi'ar adviserAraki.[citation needed]\nMentor and Plutonia have been seen in the interim in their normal forms. This may indicate Strel and Kyte have been defeated or it may indicate that like the humans the raptor armor was never meant to work with their respective species thus Mentor and Plutonia never lost their free will. Also Talon has shown the ability to shape shift, so Strek and Kyte may just be masquerading as their hosts.[citation needed]\nAfter theMultiversewas reset, the Fraternity had become an independent crew of murderous zealots operating under the radar of the Shi'ar Empire and itscurrent emperorin pursuit of becoming a predominant paramilitary authority throughout the universe. Lacking the Raptor Android armor technology of the true fraternity, their first step was the collection and acquisition of items of power scattered across the galaxies.\nOne search in particular led them to the decimated remains ofXandarformer home base of theNova Corps.[1]Initially coming there looking for remnants of theNova Force, all they found was the last Denarian class Nova still on active duty;Robbie Rider. Whom they took aboard their return ship and brainwashed him into service of their corrupted cause throughSimulated Realityintegration. Accepting him as one of their own over the years of mental conditioning that followed, Robbie rechristened himself as Talonar; in which he offered to secure a pair ofNega-Bandsfrom an impounded Nova Corps detainment facility.[2]\nHe was beaten to the punch however whenStar Lordand hiscrewunknowingly stole theRaptor vesselhe was after. In the meantime, two raptor designates Canorus and Aceptar were dispatched toEarthon his orders to obtain the known Raptor Amulet fromChris Powell. The tables were turned however for in re-activating theRazor Androidit merged with its previous host and they were now taking the fight to them.[3]\nTracking back to the Guardians issue, Talonar takes a squadron of Raptors to battle in order to claim his prize, in the skirmish he managed to poison rocket with toxin tipped claws before making off with one half of the bands.[4]Hearing of this, Quill went in search of Talonar and the two clashed in epic battle, each bearing half the power the Nega Bands where they eventually crashed landed on a planetoid as they kept losing their power mid-fight. Though Robbie had Quill on the ropes for a moment, Star-Lord got the upper hand in the end of the skirmish; in exchange for the antidote, his half of the bands and the assassin's life.\nPeter opted to spare him and relinquish his find for the cure to his toxin, on his word Peter gave up his band; right before chucking it through a portal into Ultron afflicted territory.[5]It was soon revealed The Raptors had established a sizable spy operation within the galaxy, particularly within the resettling Nova Corps.\nDeep cover operatives helped the Fraternity undermine the Nova Corps as well as hide behind the few crooked Novas' shady dealing while relaying sensitive information coming their way to the Raptors.[6]They even paid some of the more corrupt corpsmen to purposely release Thanos from their custody while falsifying a report that he escaped.[7]When news came of a membership revocation on part of the corps, the splinter cell of Raptors were ordered to pave the way for invasion ofThe Rockby causing internal structural damage while their main forces were on their way to decimate the perceived weakened Nova Corps.[8]This information was falsified however and instead the invading force was decimated byAnt-Manand a Nova Force empoweredRocket.[9]\nAfter learning that thePower Stonewas on the planetXitaung,[9]a contingent of Raptors tried to seize it, leading to a three-way battle between the Raptors, the Nova Corps, and a group ofChitaurilead byWarbringerfor the Power Stone. The Guardians of the Galaxy intervened and were able to take control of the Power Stone, causing Xitaung's destruction and forcing the Raptors to retreat.[10]\nSeeking to liberate thethe real Raptorsfrom theTree of Shadows, theFraternity of Raptorstook Talon-R to the Shi'ar Outpost IV so he could open a doorway to theNull Spacewith the power of hisNega-Bands. To their surprise, the real Raptors were already free and no longer needed to bond with a living being to work. The freed Raptors killed all the pretenders save for Talon-R, who used the Nega-Bands to protect himself.[11]\nNeeding a living being to serve as the willing tribute of a ritual that would unlock the true power of theStarhawkwithin their ranks,[12]Gyre convinced Talon-R to join them in their quest to bring order to the galaxy.[11]With a subdued Chris Powell serving as the forced tribute, Gyre completed the ritual and transformed Talon-R into the Dark Starhawk using Chris'Raptor Amulet.[12]\nRobbie and the Raptors planned to raze Earth but were confronted by Chris, Robbie's brother Nova, andDeath's Head. An intense fight broke out when Nova trying his best to reason with his brother, but his words fell on deaf ears. Robbie then killed Gyre, preferring to carrying out his own version of order in the universe. Moments later, Death's Head rigged the power core of the Kree ship the Raptors stole to explode, wiping out the Raptors except for Robbie, though he was stunned. Chris took the opportunity to reclaim his Raptor Amulet. Though badly injured, Robbie was able to flee by striking his Nega-Bands together.[13]\nRobbie later assembled a new contingent of Raptors and obtained a new ship. He witnessed the Infinity Stones leave Earth afterAdam Warlockgave them sentience and noted that one Stone remained on Earth and that the Raptors needed to find the Stones' new wielders.[14]"

When a nearby star went nova, ensuing radiation gave sentience to the robots, who quickly chafed at the illogical directives of the humanoids. Seeking to end their servitude, the robots used genetic engineering to give intelligence and awareness to the animals that had been left as companions for the patients.[6]The robots made the animals anthropomorphic to engender a cheerful atmosphere, keeping the most dangerous inmates happy.[2]The day of Rocket's first birthday,[7]robots experimented on him to give him intelligence through painful and traumatic surgery. Rocket's DNA was altered similarly to how theKreemade theInhumans. After the surgery, Rocket woke up to see his new body that walked upright in a mirror, noticing he wore a ranger uniform now.[5]His extended limbs and human-like body had to be maintained with a metal exo-skeleton.[8]In a \"comforting children's tale\" version of Rocket's memories, he saw his gaining the uniform as his birthday gift from his friends.[7]Rocket and his fellow animals knew it was their duty to look after the least dangerous patients from the surface of the planet, whom they called Loonies, but the animals were initially unaware of their true roles and history.[9]Halfworld's surface was divided into two, half industrialized and manned by robots that created technology for the animals, and half a verdant paradise where Rocket and his fellows lived with the Loonies. Over time the animals created their own society, with the major industry being toymaking for the Loonies' amusements. Rival companies arose, with the saurianLord Dyvyne's Dyvynities, Inc. challenging Inter-Stel Mechanics, run by the moleJudson Jakes.[9]\nIn more of Rocket's early memories, he flew a kite[10]and helpedPykothe Engineer tortoise replace his friendWal Rus's teeth for weaponized, mechanical prosthesis after he broke his original ones.[7]Later, Halfworld hosted a talent show. Rocket dressed up as a magician and performed magic tricks; this angered Dyvyne, as Rocket's tricks drew attention away from the music band he'd formed with Jakes and the bunnyBlackjack O'Hare. Pyko attempted exposing the trick to Rocket's magic, but ended up with a face full of confetti, unaware that Rocket was employing a compact teleporter in the shape of a wand to make anything appear from his hat.[11]Later, Rocket and all his friends watched a horror movie. While Rocket slept that night, he was awakened by a noise which turned out to be a sentient robot calledMicah 2.0, who became Rocket's friend.[12]Rocket played bowling with Micah,Lylla, Wal Rus' niece, Wal Rus and his usual friends. After that, he participated in a soap box derby, for which Lylla gave him a kiss on the cheek, flushing Rocket. Although it seemed like Blackjack would win due to cheating, a gadget in Rocket's car gave him the first place.[13]\nWhen Rocket was roughly six years old, he was somehow spotted outside Halfworld, where he metGamora, the most dangerous woman in the galaxy, and the two of them were captured byBadoons. They were rescued byJesse Alexanderand hisSupernovas, and Rocket and Gamora formed a friendship with Jesse.[14]\nBack in Halfworld, Lylla became Rocket's girlfriend and Wal Rus became Rocket's partner. When Rocket bought a ship for the two of them, Wal Rus wanted to name it Wailing Wal, but Lylla proposedRakk 'n' Ruin, and Rocket liked the alliteration with his own name. Wal Rus was left playfully resentful about this, refusing to refer to the ship as belonging to the two of them. As they used the ship to travel Halfworld, Rocket became known as the fastest gun in the Quadrant.[15]Once,the Hulkarrived to the planet,[15]but he experienced a \"comforting children's tale\" version of the world, presumably from being immersed in a virtual reality, perhaps even along with Rocket and his friends. Hulk was promptly sent back to Earth to prevent him from upsetting the status quo.[9]\nAround this time, Rocket was teleported to an arena along with every Earther super-hero when theGrandmasterandDeathdecided to make a deal wherein each would choose twelve champions from Earth. If the Grandmaster's team won, he would be given the power to restore the life of his deceased brother, theCollector. If he lost, he'd forfeit his life as well. However, Rocket was not picked for either team and was returned to Halfworld.[16]\nSoon after, war erupted between Dyvyne and Jakes' companies.[17]Blackjack attempted to usurp power himself, becoming a target for both Dyvyne and Jakes, and forcing him to join forces with Rocket.[18]The Rakk 'n' Ruin was destroyed, but the group ended the conflict when Pyko deciphered the Halfworld Bible, the logbook of the hospice ship Gideon, one of the vessels that founded Halfworld.[19]Armed with the knowledge of their origin and true nature, Rocket and his associates expanded their operations to the entire asylum.[9]\nRocket became security chief, with Blackjack as his number two and Dyvyne as head of psychology. Initially the revised system worked well, and new patients from around the cosmos were safely admitted and treated, but problems arose with the arrival of alpha class psychicBarry Bauman. A villain known as the Star-Thief, his body had been killed byWarlock,[20]but his mind had survived, jumping from one body to the next until it was taken to Halfworld. Bauman withstood all therapy; possessing guards and inmates alike, he caused riots and disruption, the first security breach in 30 years. If he got out he could infect the entire galaxy, and Rocket knew it was only a a matter of time, so he turned the bio-organic nature of Halfworld against Bauman. Halfworld became the lock, and Rocket turned the wardens into the key: only their unique cellular patterns could combine to open the lower levels of the asylum. Unless they were all present and willing, Bauman could never escape. To ensure this, Rocket had to leave the planet. It was his duty as security chief. He handed his badge to Blackjack, and Judson Jakes became the new number two. As a part of his redesigns before leaving, Rocket suggested making all the security clown drones out of bioreactive dendronic wood fromPlanet Xbecause it was better suited to Halfworld's eco-security system. Rocket then used immersion therapy to wipe his mind so he would never be tempted to return, only taking half-memories of adventures he had participated in. After Rocket left in a ship, Lylla moved on and married Blackjack O'Hare.[2]Rocket's mind-wipe process led to regular memory losses that would make him forget his origin or that others like him existed out there.[21][22]\nRocket acknowledges he blocked out many memories\nIn these whimsical memories, the clowns guards that protected Halfworld became killer robots, and Dyvyne and Jakes played the part of mad tyrants who constantly chased riches, power, and kidnapped Lylla. The otter, in turn, became a helpless princess who pleaded for her hero, Rocket, to rescue her, and Blackjack was the criminal leader of the mercenary team called theBlack Bunny Brigade.[17]In these memories, Rocket wrongly remembered Jakes and Dyvyne dying and Rocket leaving the planet with every single animal like a quadrupled Noah, looking for adventures and to discover whether there existed normalcy outside of the Keystone Quadrant.[23]\nBack in reality, Rocket found himself piloting a ship called Rakk 'n' Ruin II. When he spotted an injuredKang The Conquerorfloating in space, he brought him into his ship.[24]As a time traveler, Kang saw the threat theKing in Blackwould pose inthe future, so he convinced Rocket to head to Earth, where they found theBlack Knightin theAvengers Mansion.[25]He had been attacked by a servant of the King In Black,Mister E, who stole hisEbony Bladeto destroy it because it was one of the only things that could harm his king. Mister E piloted theQuinjetWayfarer and headed toKnowhere, where he could hire theTrollUliciato destroy the sword. Rocket, Kang and the Black Knight headed there after picking up the superheroesSpider-ManandCaptain Marvel.[26]The heroes arrived to find Mister E in a fight withUlik, Ulicia's brother. Although Rocket shot at the enemy, he used the Sword to return the fire, and only Kang's force-field saved Rocket's life. Working together, the heroes defeated Mister E, whom Kang sent toThe Collector. Afterwards, Rocket and company fought Ulik for possession of the Ebony Sword, and beat him with the help ofCosmo. However, it turned out Ubik had been sent byThe Watcher, who wanted the sword to kill the King in Black.[27]Soon, Mister E returned, and Spider-Man shouted they would be guardians of the galaxy against him, a name Rocket liked. Rocket managed to wield the Ebony Blade, but failed to destroy Mister E, a feat Captain Marvel pulled off. Afterwards, she used the sword to extinguish a giant shadow that was eclipsing the Earth's Sun. After the adventure, the Watcher erased everyone's memories.[28]\nSome time afterwards, Rocket was captured by the enigmaticStranger, and imprisoned in hisLaboratory Worldfor study. Rocket remained there until freed byOvermind.[29]\nWhen Rocket stopped by the planet Dandesh Four to refuel his ship, he saw an alienD'barishapeshifting into aXartanand realized the Xartans were hiding from theSkrullsby posing as the extinguished D'bari. Because of this discovery, the D'bari started fighting him. Rocket did fine until the arrival ofTaryn O'Connell, a member of theOvoidrace, and the trucker-turned-space explorerRazorback.He distracted Rocket and the D'bariVukused a petrifying gun on him.[30]When the planet was invaded by Skrulls, Vuk set his device to overload, threatening to petrify everything within 100,000 miles. This had the reverse effect on Rocket, who changed back to flesh and blood. After being freed, he got acquainted withShe-Hulk.[31]\nRocket meets his mentor, Frankie.\nLater, Rocket had an encounter with theTroyjans, which resulted in a copy of his hide being mounted on the Troyjan kingArmaggedon's wall.[32]\nOverall, Rocket's travels were less than stellar. Eventually, he became homeless, having to search for food in the trash to survive. In this state, he metFrankie Fat Hands, an alien who took Rocket under his wing and taught him how to steal and be a lowlife – how to survive in an uncaring universe.[33]\nAfter this, Rocket became a bounty hunter. One of Rocket's first bounties wasChammy, a low-level loser smuggler who powered his ship with baby powder.[34]During this time, Rocket freebooted regularly with theStarjammers[35]. He did business in Penasco withMacho Gomezbefore turning him to the authorities.[22]Later, Rocket paid a visit to his old friend She-Hulk at her office inTimely Plaza, Earth.[36]When theTime Variance Authorityput She-Hulk on trial for temporal meddling, they briefly pulled Rocket out of time to serve as a witness.[37][9]Back in the present, Rocket was caught on camera byHeather Hudson, who proposed selling a program about him toMojo.[38]Mojo gained an interest in Rocket that he would pursue years later.[39]\nRocket is framed for Otta's crimes\nDespite everything, Rocket was not able to move past Lylla. In this rebound he metOtta, who had come to the rimworlds looking for adventure. She played the broken heartstrings of Rocket's heart like a Stradivarius, or maybe he played himself, just to hear something again. He followed her willingly into her life of crime, of big scores wherein Rocket used his heightened senses to crack safes. They lived in high-class bars or beach planets for a month, until the cash ran dry, and then went back to the piggy bank for more. Rocket had rules; only hit the bad guys, the fat cats, the creeps. And zero killing. Nobody got hurt, until Rocket and Otta were caught by a lousy Restricted Zone Infraction that got out of hand. True to her nature, Otta blamed Rocket for everything, and he was sent away to a Kree prison.[40]\nRocket meets Groot for the first time\nThere, Rocket met his cellmateGroot. Rocket couldn't understand Groot's three-word language, which angered him. The raccoon kept his distance and stayed on his side of the cell until he saw some guards bullying Groot for his speech. This brought out the security chief in him and, after he scared the guards off, the two prisoners began a friendship and Groot built Rocket a bed of leaves. When the guards came back for revenge, Rocket discovered he could now understand Groot's speech and the two friends took out the guards.[41]\nWhile Rocket and Groot were in prison, the universe came under attack, as supervillainUltronhad reached the mechanic speciesPhalanx, taking control of them and upgrading them.[42]They started spreading throughout the galaxy, infecting everyone with their mechanic virus and taking over their wills. They infectedHala's empire, and built a gigantic tower with which they created a barrier across Kree-space, sealing them off from the other empires.[43]\nRocket and Groot were recruited byStar-Lord (Peter Quill), who was tasked with leading a team of expendables pulled from prisoners – some of them which volunteered, inspired by the legend of Star-Lord. While arming them, Rocket gravitated toward larger weapons and exceeded expectations. Groot acted as Rocket's heavy ordnance transport.\nThe prototype Guardians of the Galaxy are formed\nRounding out the team wereBug, ex-Micronaut;Deathcry, aShi'arberserk;Mantis, the celestial Madonna, andGabriel Vargas, the latestCaptain Universe. The team was given uniforms that dampened heat signatures and avoided technology, making them invisible to the Phalanx.[44]\nInfiltrating Hala, the team accessed a sub-level the Phalanx had set up shop in, looking for the replication plant. When they were caught in a fight between Phalanx robots andAnnihilationbugs, Deathcry went feral and Captain Universe was forced to kill her for the safety of the team. Being a rookie, Gabriel was left traumatized. Getting swarmed, Groot stayed behind to allow his team to escape. Rocket wailed as his buddy sacrificed himself and they got away. Peter was cold about the whole ordeal, considering everyone expendable.[1]\nThe team spent two days running in circles. The drones knew what they looked like, so Peter came up with the idea of changing clothes with a civilian. His crew was multi-colored, so he was the only one who could pass for a pink-skinned Kree. When he had been made an honorary Kree, he had been given a special universal password. With it, he was able to access the computers and look for something that wasn't there before. Peter found out the Phalanx were doing large-scale insemination through an airborne nanovirus, using the Kree people as incubators without them even knowing it. Meanwhile, the wait was killing Rocket, who cleaned his weapons over and over, making his teammates wonder if he had any obsessive/compulsive behavior they should know about. Suddenly, Groot showed up, this time the size of a hand. He was a flora life form, capable of regrowing from a single sprig. Rocket caught many rides in Groot's shoulder, so now it was only fair he let Groot ride in his. Peter came back with the intel and they discussed what to do. After Groot said they should just genocide the inferior, infected Kree people, and demanded moisture to grow, Rocket responded by spitting on him. Afterwards, they were swarmed by maintenance drones, as the Phalanx were purging the sub-levels of all life forms. Rocket used his super-smell to find a water pipe, causing a flood and buying them time. However, Captain Universe was forced to stay behind to let the others escape. The team reached the surface, but they were captured all the same, everyone except for Mantis. On top of that, all of them had been infected with the Phalanx airborne virus.[3]\nThe team was useful for the Phalanx as a way to study the effects of the virus on diverse life forms, so they weren't killed. Mantis reunited with Captain Universe, who had barely survived. The Captain's Uni-Force suggested the Phalanx were pathologically methodical, meaning they wouldn't release the virus unless they had an antidote for it. To find information, Gabriel released the Uni-Force so that it'd find a new host in one of the Phalanx. Meanwhile, Mantis helped the others escape detention. While they were fighting the guards, Groot received a shot and they discovered their enemies guns were set to stun. It turned out the Kree guards had no intention of obeying the Phalanx, and felt honored to be next to the Star-Lord; despite Peter's claims that Star-Lord was dead, his ideals couldn't die. The Uni-Force used its Phalanx host to access the Phalanx's common core, download the contagion countermeasure and purge the program. It then killed its host and returned to Gabriel. The team reunited and stole a ship to escape the planet. Peter warned Rocket, who was piloting, about the orbital security perimeter he had designed, but Rocket used his enhanced instincts and superior tactic skills to work around it. Afterwards, every member earned a pardon, but they were not off the hook yet. The Phalanx threat was very much still real, so Peter's team wasn't decommissioned, much to Peter's dismay.[45]\nThe Annihilation Conquest war raged on. Peter led the resistance efforts together with his crew. He took Blastaar to the Phalanx to be captured just to get some of Groot's spores inside the Phalanx's Babel spire. The spores filled every crevice of it, and Mantis used her telepathy to construct a schematic of the place. They then infiltrated the spire and filled it with explosives, but Peter was captured by Ultron and Gabriel was killed.[46]\nUltron began torturing Peter to get the secrets of the resistance, but Mantis reinforced his mind from the distance, protecting him. As the team's tactician, Rocket took over and tried to think of a plan B.[47]When Ultron moved to bigger concerns, Rocket pulled off a rescue operation and freed Peter. His plan was to have Groot sprout below the spire, with Mantis using her telepathy to boost his cellular growth rate until he covered one-tenth of the facility, plus reconfiguring him to make him ultra-flammable. It was Groot's idea, as he could grow back from a cutting he had given Rocket. They made him explode and blew up the spire, then everybody jumped to their deaths.[48]With his last strength, Groot created a giant arm to catch the team, saving them. Afterwards,Quasar (Phyla-Vell)took down Ultron and the war ended.[49]\nAftermath of the Conquest\nTwo days after the Phalanx conquest, Peter blamed himself for everything that had happened, but he felt inspired. He had the idea to create a team to avoid future crisis like that one, a team of guardians for the galaxy. There had been two wars in rapid succession, so he wanted to assemble a team to stop the next ones from happening and be proactive.[49]He recruited Rocket — he needed the military smarts, and he had the best tactical mind Peter had ever met — along with Quasar, Groot,Drax, Gamora, Warlock and Mantis. To ensure everything ran smoothly, the diverse personalities didn't clash and nobody questioned the team's dynamic, Peter had Mantis tamper with the team's minds, making everyone compliant.[50]And so theGuardians of the Galaxywere formed, although they still didn't have a name.Novarecommended they set up a base inKnowhere, where they were backed up by the place's security chief,Cosmo, a talking dog.[51]Rocket was naturally predisposed against him; anthropomorphic animals gave him the willies.[52]\nThe amounts of deaths accumulated from the Phalanx invasion and the olderNegative Zone Invasiondemanded theMultiverse[51]tipped the scales of its ever ongoing war betweenAvatars of LifeandDeath,[53]so reality began being prodded by a neighboring universe called theCancerversewhere death did not exist.[54]This caused rifts in space/time[51]and erased future timelines.[55]The Guardians' key goal was to prevent the fissures from opening in the fabric of space. In their first mission, they boarded a Templeship from theUniversal Church of Truthto prevent it from flying into one of these fissures. When they got too close, the leaders teleported away, abandoning their followers. Right then, a squid monster from beyond the rift invaded the ship. Rocket used his “special six” grenade to blow up the power battery, destroying half the ship. Then, Warlock and Quasar absorbed the energy to drive the monster back to where it came from. Once the team guided the templeship to a safe port, they teleported to their base in Knowhere.[51]\nAs soon as the team got home, the deep-range monitor alerted them of another fissure.[51]The team teleported to the vicinity of56 Hydronis, where a hole in space was altering space/time and spewed out an island of limbo ice, which was frozen time. The things entombed in the ice began waking up, and the Guardians were attacked by monsters. With them,Vance Astroalso woke up, Major Victory of the 30th Century'sGuardians of the Galaxy, and he took out the monsters. The team contained the anomaly, and they teleported away. Star-Lord was inspired, as what really cemented theAvengerswas findingCaptain Americafrozen in a block of ice, and now they had found their own hero with a Captain Americashield. Rocket thought the name “Guardians of the Galaxy” was pretty cool, too, so that was when they got the idea for their own name. Shortly after, the Guardians' deep-range monitor notified them of another fissure inBinary Stasis Twelve, a Dyson Sphere located on the edge of the Rebreg Nebula, a sun enclosed inside an artificial shell. They arrived in a habitable zone protected from the sun by a dome, but they couldn't find any of the inhabitants, despite getting life readings. Suddenly,Raker, commanding theCardinals of the Universal Church of Truth, teleported in,[56]seeking revenge on the Guardians for wrecking their Templeship. The church was powered by the prayer-power of its trillions of faithful followers, so bullets didn't hurt them, but Rocket thought they just hadn't met a gun big enough yet. Suddenly, a wave of green goo appeared and swallowed up the Cardinals, that being the anomaly they had come to fight. The biomasswasthe sphere's population, all fused together after their genetic research went wrong. It was going critical, which would result in a fissure. Rocket brought along plenty of bombs, but not enough. Star-Lord came up with a plan to lift the sun-shield protecting the habitable zone and let the sun fry the biomass. However, when they tried to teleport away, they found Knowhere was not responding.[57]\nIndeed, the base got wrecked when Vance Astro was attacked by another citizen of the 30th century,Starhawk. He worked with theCouncil of the Guardians of All Galaxies, a gathering of Guardians of the Galaxy groups from different timelines who started to see their realities collapse because of the Timeflux War, a disruption in time that erased history or replaced it with dark alternatives. It all originated from some crucial error in the past, near the period when the concept of the Guardians was first created. To find that error and solve it, Starhawk traveled back in time.[58]He attacked Vance, believing him to be that error, and fled.[57]\nBack in Binary Stasis Twelve, Quasar covered everyone from the sun with a magic shield, but she couldn't resist for long. Heroically, Gamora left the protection of the shield, running to the dome controls to lower the sun-shield again. She only barely survived thanks to her healing factor, and all her skin was burned off. The situation was solved, albeit inelegantly.[57]\nAfter the Guardians returned to Knowhere, they tried to get answers from Vance about his attacker, but he couldn't remember anything. Rocket was suspicious, as his amnesia was just too convenient. Shortly after, there was a bombing incident in Knowhere, resulting in thirty-eight dead. Three of the corpses revealed themselves to be shape-shiftingSkrulls, and Rocket mentioned the elephant in the room that they had to assume there were more of them, disguised as citizens. Tensions rose, with the Guardians accusing each other of being Skrulls. They were interrupted by theLuminals, a strike-force that policed Knowhere before the Guardians arrived. They thought the Guardians brought trouble with them, so Star-Lord promised they would cooperate. When Vance was attacked under suspicion of being a Skrull, Cosmo was forced to order the Guardians to stay confined to their quarters. Rocket couldn't believe they were taking orders from a dog he couldn't stand. Inevitably, problems arose when Drax was not found in his quarters.[52]\nAs the Luminals searched for him, Rocket and Star-Lord shared a moment. Rocket told Peter to be careful, as this crisis could cause the team to unravel. They had only just been put together, so the glue wasn't set. Peter said he wouldn't let that happen, and neither would Mantis. Before Rocket could ask what he meant, the team was attacked by Starhawk, only this time it was a female version of her, which Rocket happened to find very attractive. She explained she thought the “error” was Vance, but since the Guardians shouldn't exist yet in the timeline, it must be all of them. Right then, Drax triggered bombs all over Knowhere, killing all of its inhabitants.[55]\nIn reality, he just rendered everyone braindead for ninety seconds to be able to locate the Skrulls. Rocket and the rest woke up shortly after, and they resumed trying to hold Starhawk down until Peter knocked her out. They got a call from Quasar, who explained what happened and where to locate the Skrulls. As it turned out, Cosmo was helping the Skrulls remain hidden because they were refugees. They were pacifists Skrulls, fleeing from the empire. The bomb that started everything had been triggered by an agent of the jihadist regime. Not knowing this, the Luminals arrived and started wrecking everything. Cosmo got mad, knocking everyone out telekinetically. Afterwards, Drax told everyone Peter had tampered with their minds to make them join the team. Peter thought calling it brainwashing was too strong, and that it was gently rinsing, maybe. Despite joking, he made no apologies. The universe needed the Guardians, so he asked for an ice-breaker. He'd figured once they had bonded it wouldn't matter how they had come together. The team couldn't forgive him, and everyone split up. Rocket stayed, however, puzzled at how they had a team just a moment ago. He wouldn't let the dream end. Meanwhile, Mantis wept. Her future vision showed her things going differently. Somehow, Starhawk's tampering managed to disrupt the timeline.[50]\nAfter the break up, Peter left as well, but it wasn't the end of the Guardians. When Mantis was woken in the middle of the night by a psychic scream for help, Rocket decided he had to throw together a new team and do something about it. He called his old buddy Bug, along with Vance Astro, Mantis, and a fully-grown Groot, and threw himself in as team leader,[59]helped by his experience as captain of the Rakk 'n' Ruin.[60]They went to theBenthuscolony, aSpartax Empiredependency in the Callisto sector. Vance Astro recognized the monsters they were fighting asZomslave troops from theBadoon. Inhis timeline, the Badoon had conquered the galaxy and exterminated the human race. His fears were justified when the Badoon released a monster against them, a super-heavyweight battlefield bio-construct.[59]Rocket kept thinking “what would Star-Lord do?”. Groot destroyed the monster, and the Badoon decided to communicate with the Guardians. They explained they were performing a weapons test against live targets. Rocket announced that that world was under their protection, and the Badoon left.[61]\nAfterward, the team continued trying to find Star-Lord. The Kree ambassador told Rocket they had no knowledge of Peter's whereabouts, despite the continuum cortex logs showing Hala as the last destination in Star-Lord's passport. Suddenly, Mantis screamed, having received a psychic S.O.S. from Star-Lord. He was trapped in thePrison 42in theNegative Zone. Cosmo teleported the team in, sending them to the middle ofBlastaar's army, who was trying to conquer the prison to access the Positive Universe.[62]Amidst the fighting, Rocket found Star-Lord's helmet, and realized Blastaar must have taken Star-Lord's armor as spoils of war. They'd locked onto Peter's teleportation passport, but he wasn't wearing it anymore. Mantis located Peter telepathically, and Cosmo teleported them to him. They grabbed Peter and his new friend,Jack Flag, and they teleported to Earth. From there, they told theFantastic Fourto keep theNegative Zone Portalclosed so Blastaar couldn't come in, and Rocket's short tenure as team leader ended.[63]\nShortly after, Phylla (calling herself Martyr) and Drax returned to the team, bringingMoondragonwith them, and Warlock and Gamora came back as well. Warlock explained the Kree and theShi'arhad gone towar. The Shi'ar had already usedNega-Bombs, and the fabric of space/time would not withstand such abuse. The war had to be put to an end. Warlock still wouldn't take orders from Peter, but he thought they should work together for this common purpose. Peter and Rocket discussed tactics. They would make two teams and send them to try to talk some sense into the rulers, KingVulcanfor the Shi'ar andBlack Boltof the Inhumans for the Kree. The Inhumans were civilized, so Rocket called the heavy hitters for his Shi'Ar team: Warlock, Groot, Major Victory and Drax.\nRocket stares down Gladiator\nBefore confronting Vulcan, they had to contain the Nega-bomb damage atDisradi, where a fissure had appeared. While Warlock cast a sealing spell, the scan showed Vulcan's ship was in the vicinity, watching the planet cook. Rocket asked to be teleported there after they were done with the fissure. Unfortunately, the ship was teleport-shielded, so the team ended up dispersed in space. Only Warlock made it inside, being magic-based. Rocket and the rest were rescued by the Starjammers, Rocket's old buddies. The Starjammers flew away, planning to rescue MajestrixLilandra, restore her to the throne of the Shi'ar Empire, and topple the tyrant Vulcan.[35]The group boarded the Shi'ar warbird holding Lilandra, where they faced the Shi'ar'sImperial Guard. Rocket went face to face withGladiator, their leader, and came out on top.[64]\nThe good guys freed Lilandra, but Gladiator realized Rocket's gun couldn't possibly have defeated him; it was all a psychic illusion cast byMarvel Girl. He rushed to Lilandra's side, but she convinced him to join them. Gladiator accepted his true allegiance and fought off his fellow Guards.[64]After completing their mission, Rocket and the other Guardians returned to Knowhere, which they found overrun by Shi'ar forces. They counterattacked, but the Shi'ar soldiers told them Lilandra had been assassinated. Rocket took it badly. He thought they had stopped the war in its tracks, but now things were ten times worse. The Guardians reunited, except for Star-Lord, Flag, Mantis and Bug, who had disappeared. Suddenly, Knowhere came back to life, as the gigantic head of aCelestialthat it was, and announced it had detected a great threat.[65]Knowhere was voicing a message Star-Lord had sent from the future, from a doomed timeline. The timestream was breaking down because of a catastrophic “error” and Peter believed it to be the ending of the War of Kings. The Inhumans possessed aTerrigen Bomb, and detonating it would cause a fissure in space-time so big it would be called The Fault. Sadly, the message came too late.[66]Both kings killed each other, the bomb was detonated and the Fault was created.[64]\nThe Fault would keep expanding until it swallowed up the universe. The Guardians teleported toAttilan, to make sure the Inhumans didn't have another super-weapon. Rocket told the Royal Family he had told them so. Suddenly, gigantic tentacles came out of the fissure, grabbed the city and began dragging it in. They started to hatch, spawning organisms from pustules on them. The Guardians decided to work together with the Inhumans. Rocket and Groot followedMaximus the Madto his inventions room. Maximus pretended to understand Groot's speech, acting like Groot was well-educated royalty.[66]As it was later learned, however, Groot was just pretending to be a king.[67]Regardless of the truth, Maximus got an idea for an invention that destroyed the monsters. Later, a fleet of ships from the Universal Church of Truth arrived. They were led by Warlock, who was using the church's faith power to cast a spell to seal the Fault. Time and space had torn loose, and Adam intended to connect the timeline to an inert timestream, a stable, unused future. The spell worked, and the Fault's expansion ceased, even if it was still open. Before they could celebrate, Martyr killed Warlock. She revealed that to bring back Moondragon from the death she had to become an agent ofDeath, and she promised to kill the Avatar of Life when the moment came.[66]This was the first step of the Endwar, the eternal war between Life and Death.[68]In retaliation, Gamora killed Martyr, but it was a mistake.The futureto which Warlock anchored them was the one where he became his evil double,Magus. Warlock woke up, having become the Magus, and killed Gamora.[66]Fortunately, this chain of events was prevented when Star-Lord appeared from the future into the past and stopped Martyr from stabbing Warlock. When Rocket heard Peter's voice, the rest of the Guardians teleported in. Sadly, Warlock explained he didn't displace the timestream; he overlapped it, meaning he'd been Magus for months by then. He turned evil, killing Cosmo and Mantis. Rocket lost it, but bullets were nothing against the Magus. Martyr, Gamora and Vance were the next to die. In the end, Star-Lord was forced to kill Magus with aCosmic Cubehe had obtained in the future. The church Cardinals went insane with grief, which detonated their ships. The Guardians saved the universe again, but it didn't come cheap.[69]\nLater, in the interest of sealing the Fault, the Guardians reunited with theNova Corps,Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.andWendell Vaughn. Wendell traveled into the Fault to gather info, and he found aCancerversewhere every hero had been twisted and corrupted by theMany-Angled Ones. He managed to escape, just barely.[54]\nAround this time, Rocket, working with his old friend Wal-Rus, and Groot, infiltrated a cargo ship to rescue the stranded princessLynxfrom Lord Dyvyne for the King of Felis-1. They fought against Rocket's old foe Blackjack O'Hare and his Black Bunny Brigade, who apparently served evil once more. The princess was mad that Rocket had ruined the element of surprise for her own troops, which were on their way. However, Rocket had hacked their navigation system so that they were halfway across the galaxy. Rocket stole Dyvyne's crown and rescued the princess, but he grew to like her, so when it came to cashing in the bounty for her to Uncle Pyko, Rocket lied and said Dyvyne thwarted them. Even though Lynx's bounty could have cleared Rocket's debt, he did the right thing. He could sell Dyvyne's crown, anyway.[70]\nLater, the Guardians organized another scouting mission beyond the Fault, and they sent Rocket and Drax. Drax was attacked by a snake monster which dragged him underground. Rocket was scared from the tip of his tail to the roots of his whiskers, but he went after him. He found that Drax had killed the monster all by himself, but they were swallowed by its father. Groot pulled from his end of the lifeline, bringing the monster to their side. They shut the portal down, slicing the monster in two, and Rocky and Drax crawled out, covered in slobber.[71]\nLater, during a council meeting, Moondragon passed out. Peter suggested she just hadn't had time to grieve, but Rocket was surprised she showed emotions at all. When some Universal Church of Truth pilgrims entered the bar, Rocket got pissed off and wondered what was the point of a chief of security, until he remembered Cosmo had died, too. Suddenly, xenomorph filter alarms went off. The Luminals had sent a scouting mission into the Fault, and one of their members had come back infected. The parasite inside him grabbed Moondragon.[71]The monster began invading her, and she barely managed to repel it. The Guardians arrived, but the situation got messy when they were overrun by Church pilgrims who believed the parasite was a holy being. In the end, the monster went inside Moondragon, infecting her completely. Ignoring common sense, the Luminals chained their leaderCynosureto Moondragon to ensure she would go with them to take the parasite inside her to trial. Before either side could do anything, Moondragon and Cynosure were kidnapped by the Universal Church of Truth.[72]As Rocket was the resident tactical genius, he planned a strategy to rescue them. He hid the whole of Knowhere's population inside a miniature tesseract storage crystal, figured out how to fly Knowhere, and launched it against the Church. The Guardians and the Luminals rescued Moondragon and Cynosure, and the Church leaders flew away. When the billions of faithful realized this, their belief evaporated, and the power levels died right away, instead of being sacrificed. Rocket saved Moondragon and a planet thanks to his strategy. In return, the Luminals supported the Guardians and prevented them from being punished for hijacking Knowhere. Moondragon got rid of her parasite, and everything seemed fine, but she saw a vision of Martyr. Their lost teammates were still alive.[73]\nThe Guardians were hired as guards for LadyCrystalof the Inhumans in a gathering of theGalactic Councilin PlanetOvar. Right as the council was attacked by monster assassins, Moondragon received a psychic warning from Martyr, telling her Magus was still alive.[74]Rocket and all the Guardians rushed to protect Crystal from the monsters. After Rocket killed them, king Blastaar ordered the Guardians removed, but they managed a seat on the council by claiming Groot was a delegate from Planet-X. After calming down, they heard the message that Magus was still alive.[75]The Guardians traveled toSacrosanct, the home planet of the Universal Church of Truth, where there were zero life signs. A cocoon the Church was worshipping had opened, releasingThanos, who killed Martyr. The Guardians bumped into their kidnapped teammates, whom they believed dead, and a happy reunion took place until Thanos came rampaging. Star-Lord used his cosmic cube to knock the Titan out. The Guardians earned a brief respite, and they used it to celebrate those who came back and to grieve Martyr, who didn't. Rocket and Peter had a toast to the future.[76]At this point in time, Nova considered Rocket one of the smartest and funniest persons he'd met, calling him brave and sharp and saying humans could learn from him in a Nova Corps report.[77]\nWith Thanos as their prisoner, the Guardians debated whether they should kill him. Rocket explained Thanos was a part of the game the giant abstracts likeEternityandOblivionplayed. They were little people; they couldn't touch him until they understood the consequences. He pondered if all the wars they had been through were a result of Thanos being dead recently. Meanwhile, Magus sacrificed all the followers of his church to rip the Fault open. He met his master, the CancerverseMar-Vell, who killed him. At the same time, Thanos escaped.[78]Thanos grabbed Star-Lord, but Rocket managed to intimidate him into letting Peter go.[79]\nRocket stares down Thanos\nWith that, the telepath Guardians were able to contain Thanos. When the Guardians heard about the situation at the Fault, Peter theorized that maybe they just needed to give the Cancerverse the only thing that it was missing - Death, meaning Thanos. The Guardians escorted Thanos into the Cancerverse, but upon arriving he shut down from the amounts of Life in it. To make things worse, they bumped into the CancerverseDefenders.[79]The Guardians beat them, but in an universe without death, they could just keep getting up. Eventually, Thanos recomposed and delivered permanent death to the foes. The Guardians then met that universe'sVision.[80]They traveled to that universe'sTitan, Thanos' birthplace. There, they found out Mar-Vell had caused the end of Death, and only an avatar of Death could reverse the process. Luckily, Thanos was one. However, Drax snapped, and killed him.[81]\nAs Death had rejected Thanos, he could not die, so he healed himself atom by atom in excruciating pain. Drax attacked him again, and Thanos responded by killing him. They were then attacked by that universe's Avengers, theRevengers.[82]The fight ended when the Cancerverse'sScarlet Witchbetrayed her teammates, helping the Guardians. Exhausting her powers, she sent Thanos and the Guardians to the necropsy site - the place where Death died - to execute the ritual. They were intercepted by Mar-Vell and the Revengers, so the avatars of Life and Death began fighting. Thanos revealed he just sought death, so he knelt before Mar-Vell, submitting.[83]As Mar-Vell began killing Thanos, the Guardians were captured by Cancerverse demons.[84]\nRocket grieves\nNova appeared as the cavalry, freeing them. Thanos revealed his plan: killing him would bring Death there, allowing her to claim Mar-Vell. Life lost, and the Cancerous beings were destroyed. As the universe began to collapse, Star-Lord teleported everyone away except for him and Nova. Staying behind to make sure Thanos didn't escape, they sacrificed themselves heroically. Days later, Rocket and every hero involved in the crisis attended a grim celebration in Attilan. Afterwards, the raccoon visited Peter's statue.[84]\nWithout Star-Lord, the Guardians disbanded. Rocket had nothing to do but return to a more ordinary life, working in an office as a mail clerk forTimely Inc. He was hired to boost the morale, to help them meet their quota of cute sentient animals to uplift the people who did actual work. When he received a mysterious mail, a murderous robot clown came out of it and tried to kill Rocket. After disposing of it, they tried to fire him, but he just quit. Analyzing a broken limb from the clown, he discovered it came from Planet X, the home of Groot.[67]\nWhen he arrived in Planet X, Rocket asked for King Groot, but therealKing Groot explained his friend was a pretender to the throne. Indeed, he had come back to the planet and was arrested and tried for his crimes of deception and impersonation of the king; Groot was found guilty of tree-son and exiled. He was currently serving his life sentence, chained to a training post in the isle of punishment.[67]\nRocket had come prepared; he had left a bunch of goodies in an orbital drop-box. He asked his Timely Inc analysis device to arrange a priority delivery, and he armed himself. Groot was surrounded by Cyborg Punishment Birds, so when Rocket approached they set Groot on fire. Groot burned and Rocket wept, but the tree managed to grow itself from an emergency cutting, albeit smaller. The birds were about to attack again when they were saved by the Undergrowth Resistance of Planet X: a group of tiny talking animals and plants who lived doing the bidding of their oppressive tree overlords. The only tree-form that ever noticed the hard work they put in was Groot; he was an inspiration to them. Rocket offered to guide them to throw off that yoke of subjugation, but they explained they just wanted an extra day off every month or so. Now that Groot was there, Rocket could ask him where the killer clown was made. Groot answered “Halfworld”, Rocket's birthplace. Rocket wondered why there was so much of his past he couldn't remember – until Groot said Halfworld, Rocket had forgotten there had been such a place. Rocket realized whoever sent the clown knew they couldn't get much past Timely Inc's security systems, so they carved the clown out of sentient wood because they knew that would bring Rocket to Planet X, a lawless rimworld where it was much easier to deploy a full-scale hit squad. And sure enough, the forest was attacked by a squad of killer clowns. Rocket, Groot and the Undergrowth disposed of the clowns, but the forest caught fire. To kill it, Rocket fired a cloud missile from orbit and created rain. Not wanting to stay for the celebrations, Rocket and Groot borrowed the clown's ambulance ship. Groot explained it was an ambulance because Halfworld was a lunatic asylum; Rocket began to understand why he had blocked so many memories. They reached Halfworld and the doors opened for them, but as soon as they were inside they were attacked by missiles.[21]\nTheir ship was destroyed, but Rocket and Groot escaped by hiding in a crate and using Timely Inc's priority teleport delivery system. Inside Halfworld, Rocket began to recognize people: Wal-Rus, Blackjack O'Hare, Lylla - but they knocked him out and tied him up. They administered a cortical stimulator to restore his suppressed memories: Rocket learned that his past was not full of colorful adventures, but grey and gritty experiences. Rocket was not a ranger, but a security chief.\nWhen Rocket had shown up in Halfworld, they thought Bauman had gotten to him somehow, lured him back to open the vault and let him out. Recently, Judson Jakes had been possessed. Rocket realized the killer clowns were used as bait to drag him in, so they went to interview Judson. He screamed that Bauman was as good as escaped already and the asylum's immersion systems crashed, with Judson's head exploding. Rocket rushed to open Bauman's cell, and he found a skeleton: his host body had died a long time ago. As the killer clowns turned against the good guys, Star-Thief revealed himself: he had taken control of the facility.[2]\nStar-Thief put everyone in an immersion environment to have everyone pacified. Rocket woke up in an idyllic reality, like the one from his fake memories. Soon enough, Groot appeared and rescued him. They escaped and found Star-Thief was herding all the inmates into a giant ark ship that he was using as a body. If he got out in the galaxy, he would be a bigger threat than Thanos orGalactus. Rocket grabbed Blackjack and made him snap back to reality; he needed his knowledge of Knowhere's security system. Groot created a distraction by controlling the living wood the clowns were made out of. Meanwhile, Rocket and O'Hare reached the control center and looked for something in Star-Thief's past that they could use to disrupt his attention and sedate him. He used to have a dog, so Rocket was forced to dress in a full body dog costume. The trick worked, and Star-Thief was sedated. Rocket was invited to come back to Halfworld as co-chief of security, but he explained he realized he must keep the legacy of the Guardians of the Galaxy alive. He and Groot, saving the universe whether it wanted to be saved or not.[85]\nRocket and Groot were next seen engaged in a bar fight with Badoons. They escaped, but Rocket felt there was something odd about it all. When their ship began to be chased, it just so happened to be missing their stardrive. Everything was a simulation inMojoworld, using Rocket's adventures as a TV Show.[39]Rocket and Groot's ship was destroyed, but the narrator explained: “Luckily, our heroes managed to scramble into combat space armor suits!” Rocket couldn't find the logic in any of that. They took control of one of the badoon ships, then the action changed the scene to an ice planet where they were being chased by ships. When Rocket couldn't be any more confused, his Timely Inc analysis device explained to him they were in a simulation. Rocket realized he was in a TV studio, but when a weapon made him bleed, he also realized the danger was real.[86]Mojo began to switch the environment constantly, from an ice planet to a jungle, to underwater, to a futuristic city, to a post-apocalyptic world, to deep space, to Planet X. When they were about to be crushed by a giant Groot, the simulation stopped; the Timely Inc analysis device was holding Mojo at gunpoint. They had been bought a second chance.[87]Rocket and Groot reached Mojo and killed him, but he was just a robot. His lackey explained he was running things on his own, but before they killed him, they should listen to how lucrative the whole thing was. Groot and Rocket accepted the endorsement, as long as they got 60/40 of the profits.[88]\nAs time passed without the Guardians, Rocket lost what little decency the Guardians had taught him and fell into his old habits, getting thrown in jail so often, he became an expert in escaping them.[22]He forgot his manners, becoming an irritated mass-murderer[89]who became wanted in six systems.[90]During this period, Rocket rescued a princess named Amalya from a gang of criminals.[22]She instantly fell in love with him, and the two had a brief relationship before Rocket left her and pilfered a small fortune from her family. Cast out for dishonoring the reputation of her house, and heartbroken by rejection, the now \"General\" Amalya began assemblinga team of Rocket's ex-girlfriendsfrom across the galaxy over the following three years to make him pay at any cost.[91]Meanwhile, Rocket forgot, or made himself forget, about his true past; he started believing he was the only one of his kind in the universe.\nStar-Lord didn't stay in the Cancerverse for long. Nova used the Cosmic Cube to turn himself into a gateway so Star-Lord, Drax and Thanos could escape.[92]Once back, Star-Lord put the team back together, this time without Mantis, Vance Astro, Moondragon nor Jack Flag.\nJust before rejoining the Guardians, Rocket was boasting in a bar and trying to score chicks when heard a rumor that there was another talking raccoon just like him. He tried interrogating the person who saw it, but the witness was suddenly murdered by a hooded figure. Unbeknownst to Rocket, this figure was the other raccoon, who was none other than Blackjack O'Hare, posing as Rocket to give him an identity crisis and land him in prison in revenge for Rocket having foiled his assassination attempt of Princess Amalya three years prior.[93]After joining the team, Rocket flew to a farming planet to pick up Groot; he found him helping a family that was being bullied by Tribbitite aliens into paying them for protection.[94]\nThis smaller, more compact team helped a planet that was being enslaved by the Badoon; in fact, they had been sent there by Thanos. He used the Badoon as bait so that the Guardians would be far away from Earth while he grabbed the Cosmic Cube in it. The Guardians found out and headed to Earth, where they met the Avengers and got formally acquainted with them.[95]This was the start of a new era where the Guardians would work more closely tied to Earth, visiting it frequently and accepting several new members from there.\nThanos used the Cosmic Cube to banish the two teams of heroes, but it was a weaker Cube made on Earth so they were only sent to the Cancerverse. There they meet theElders of the Universe, who had also been banished by Thanos, and they helped the heroes escape. Together, they defeated Thanos, and the Elders captured him for themselves. As the day was saved, Iron Man mentioned how he envied the Guardians for being able to explore uncharted lands freely, and Star-Lord invited him to join the team.[96]\nA crisis arose when someone kidnapped the embodiment of Death, stopping everyone in the universe from dying. The Guardians figured it must be Thanos' doing, so they tracked down one of theBlood Brothers, who worked as henchmen for Thanos, and found out the Titan's current location.[97]They found him in a Shi'ar mining operation abandoned after the Annihilation Wave: theDwindling Light. It was home to theOrder of the Glorious End, death cultists who sacrificed half of their number to summon the physical aspect of Death, after which she was taken. Among them was a rabbit from Halfworld, even. The Guardians found the Order worshiping Thanos, who was travelling withDeadpoolto try to find who took Death. The Guardians thought Thanos was responsible and they started fighting. They overpowered Thanos by ganging up on him, but Star-Lord kept things simple and pointed a gun into Thanos' throat, forcing him to talk. Rocket was proud; Star-Lord was starting to take after him. Thanos laughed, saying that because all of the Guardians had once been dead and were now alive, one could say they served Mistress Death better than him. While Star-Lord was distracted by this, the Order of the Glorious End attacked and let Thanos escape.[98]Thanos got away, but eventually he freed Death and the cycle of life continued as usual.\nWhen Groot, Rocket and Star-Lord engaged in a fight against Badoons, the space continuum broke apart due Wolverine's extensive abuse to destroy Ultron. However, only Star-Lord noticed.[99]\nWhen the Guardians found out theChitaurihad obtained anUltimate Nullifierand were heading to Earth, Rocket and Gamora visited Earth to try to findJesse Alexander, an old friend of theirs. When it turned out Jesse had disappeared, Rocket and Gamora gave his helmet to his son,Sam. Sam became the new Nova, and Rocket and Gamora trained him for a short while.[100]They planned for Nova to go on a recon mission to the approaching Chitauri fleet, but things went wrong and Nova ended up stealing their Ultimate Nullifier. When he accidentally activated it, Nova destroyed the entire fleet and the crisis was averted. Rocket told Sam he had earned the title “Nova.”[101]\nAfterwards, Rocket was present when Star-Lord told Iron Man his origin story, prompting Tony to join the team, although this lineup got rid of Bug.[102]Star-Lord's father,J'sonof Spartax, warned the Guardians a galactic council had declared Earth off-limits, but Star-Lord felt all this did was paint a target on it. His hunch turned out to be right: The badoon were angry at Earthers for having spoiled their alliance with Thanos, so they invaded.[103]The Guardians defeated them, but they were arrested by Spartax soldiers for violating the “Earth is off-limits” rule.[104]They captured everyone but Groot, who was plant-sized then, so he grew in size and rescued the Guardians.[105]\nAfter this incident, Rocket set up an “Earth signal” to warn them if anything came near Earth. The signal went off whenAngelaappeared – the sister ofThor, who had been banished to another realm but came back after the fabric of spacetime was broken by Ultron.[106]After a short fight, they figured out Angela was just trying to do sight-seeing, so they let her visit Earth.[107]Later, Rocket was present when Iron Man quit the team.[108]\nAlways orbiting around Earth, they had to help the planet again when Thanos and his armies invaded. The Guardians went to helpThe Peak, a station orbiting around Earth. Thanos' armies overwhelmed them, but they were rescued by Angela.[109]Gaining control of The Peak, the Guardians managed to open Earth's shield so that the Avengers could fly down and defeat Thanos.[110]\nAfter this event, Iron Man had to stay on Earth to deal with the consequences, so he quit the team, and Angela joined them. Thanos disappeared after being defeated, so the Guardians attacked a Badoon planet in hopes of finding intel.[111]They didn't find anything, but Rocket took the chance to plant a signal into their communications signal so that they would be alerted if there was any mention of Earth. A week later, through Badoon gossip they found out the Shi'ar planned to putJean Greyof Earth on trial for her crimes as thePhoenix, so they traveled to Earth to help theX-Men.[112]As it turned out, Jean Grey was dead, and the Shi'ar captured her past self that had traveled through time to the present, so she technically hadn't committed her crimes yet. The Guardians teamed up with a team of young X-Men from the past and went to rescue young Jean. When a Shi'ar ship started attacking their much smaller ship, Angela jumped into space to fight back, fearless. Rocket was never much attracted to femme fatales like Gamora – too many daddy issues, he said – but seeing Angela he couldn't help but wish to marry her.[113]The Guardians made it to the Shi'ar homeworld, where they clashed with the Shi'ar Imperial Guard led by Gladiator. Rocket wasn't intimidated and took the first shot.[114]\nOf course, the Guardians didn't stand a chance. They were saved by the appearance of Jean, who escaped imprisonment and unlocked new psychic abilities that put her in Gladiator's level. The Imperial Guard was defeated, and the heroes got to return home. Now the Shi'ar had their sights set on the Guardians, just like the Spartax.[115]\nRight after meeting the X-Men, the Guardians became acquainted with another Earther. They foundCaptain Marveltravelling through space under attack by mercenaries. After helping her and sending the bad guys on retreat, Carol explained she was taking a Nowlanian refugee,Tic, to the planetTorfa. As Rocket fixed Carol's ship, explanations were interrupted when he saw Carol's cat,Chewie, and freaked out. Rocket shot at it, claiming it was aFlerken]], a monster that shouldn't be allowed to lay eggs. The free shooting short-circuited Tic's chamber, so Tic woke up. As Star-Lord explained Carol must be doing something wrong, because Torfa was a poisoned planet, Tic showed up and tried to kill Star-Lord for being the prince of Spartax. Carol prevented it, but Tic escaped from the Guardians' ship and stole Carol's ship.[116]\nRocket meets Chewie\nTic started using the ship to attack the Guardians, but Carol flew into space and quickly subdued her. Handcuffed, Tic explained the king J'son of Spartax was forcing everyone in Torfa to evacuate. Tic refused to believe the planet was poisoned; she was convinced they just wanted to take their lands. Tic's home planet had been destroyed byBuildersand now they were taking her refugee planet from her - it was easier to believe in a conspiracy than to accept she had to start over again. Captain Marvel said goodbye to the Guardians and headed to Torfa to deal with whatever was making the planet poisonous.[117]She left in a borrowed shuttle and Rocket kept the Captain's ship, fixing it. When she came back with Tic she was outraged that Rocket stayed with her cat, but Rocket insisted it was a Flerken. Suddenly, they were boarded by an unknown enemy; Rocket kind of put the word out that he had the universe's last living Flerken, so people were coming for it. They went to check on the cat and discovered she had laid eggs - it was an alien after all.[118]Her eggs were hatching rapidly, so they put them on a shuttle for safety. Captain Marvel drew back the aggressors, but one of them got into the ship, only for the Flerken to devour them. Rocket fell in love. Afterwards, the Captain left to drop the pups in a rescue center.[119]\nRocket and the Guardians freed a slave encampment from the Badoon. Later, Iron Man introduced the heroVenomto the Guardians, feeling there must always be an Avenger in the team, representing Earth. At first, Rocket wasn't impressed, seeing the man lacked legs, but he could stand and was fully armed in his Venom form. Venom accepted, and Iron Man gave Star-Lord a little fail-safe device that could knock down Venom's symbiote if it ever lost control and went rogue.[120]\nShortly after, the Guardians were attacked aggressively, targeted separately by all of their enemies: the Spartax, the Shi'ar and the Badoon. Rocket, Groot and Star-Lord were caught in their ship by the Spartax.[121]Rocket was sold to the Kree Empire, and its scientists began experimenting on him to try and figure out his unique biology.[122]When Captain Marvel came to the rescue and saved Star-Lord from his father's grip, J'son was exposed as a tyrant to the entire galaxy. TheSupreme Intelligenceof the Kree realized the tables had turned and let Rocket go.[123]The Kree delivered Rocket to the Guardians as a gesture of good faith, but Rocket refused to talk of the traumatic day he went through. The team was reunited, except for Venom, who went missing.[124]\nBack on Earth, the demonic organizationMys-Techopened a gateway toHelland created a global invasion, so every superhero was called to defend Earth, including the Guardians. They went toParis, where Rocket complained about hating Earth. Even thoughBritain's heroes dealt with closing the portal, oddly enough the Guardians got credited with saving the world, and Paris hosted a celebration for them.[125]While he was on Earth, Rocket attended Quentin Quire's 17th birthday inNew York, where he fell asleep watching a screening of the movieDoop Hardalong withM.O.O.D.O.K.,Maggottand someBamfs.[126]\nWhen Rocket and Groot took some time apart from the Guardians, Groot participated in a wrestling match in the Bonavaglia Arena on the planet of Nivlent. Rocket witnessed the match with Kaleeko, a date who was actually working undercover for General Amalya and her league of Rocket's former exes. Before Kaleeko could act, Rocket was spotted by a security camera, causing an alarm to sound and the local law enforcement to arrive in the arena. During his escape, Rocket learned he was wanted for committing several murders, even seeing footage in which someone resembling Rocket murdered another man. In order to find out who this impersonator was and clear his name, Rocket and a splinter of Groot handed themselves over to the local law enforcement.[22]The next step in Rocket's plan was requesting to be sentenced to the highest level security prison planet. Once he was in Devin-9, he performed a prison break with Groot's help and headed to meet an old friend he once turned in,Macho Gomez. Gomez wanted to kill Rocket, but Rocket promised him a lot of money if Gomez could just lead him to his boss,Funtzel, an expert on info on people off the grid.\nRocket was feeling something of an identity crisis. He had always thought he was the last of his race, the last of Halfworld, but now there was someone else - this could change everything. Suddenly, Rocket, Groot and Gomez were cornered by a fleet of spaceships: the League of the Ex-Terminators. They were led by Amalya, a princess Rocket rescued three years ago.[127]Rocket and his team escaped by hyperspace and arrived on planet Sendak. They visited Funtzel and Rocket revealed his true reason for wanting to see him: the person who told Rocket about another raccoon worked for Funtzel. That person ended up dead, so Rocket figured Funtzel had reason to look into the raccoon. Funtzel admitted he did, but he didn't find anything other than whispers about the Halfworld bible. Rocket was shocked at its mere mention, but suddenly the lights went out; the impostor Rocket had come by himself.[128]He took out everyone in the building until it was just Rocket and him. He gloated about messing with Rocket's head, enjoying making him wonder if he was the last of his race. He then revealed his true identity: Blackjack O'hare. He plotted everything to take vengeance on Rocket: Three years ago, he was supposed to murder princess Amalya; it was his retirement plan. But Rocket rescued her, spoiling everything. He turned Blackjack into a joke and he could barely get jobs afterwards. The two animals started fighting, but they were interrupted by Amalya and the Ex-Terminators. She took out Blackjack and started hurting Rocket. Rocket was forced to fight with everybody at once, but in the end he was the last man standing. Right then, the Guardians came to rescue him. They threw a party for Rocket finally discovering his people, but all Rocket discovered was that the Guardians were his people. In the privacy of his room, Rocket allowed himself to cry.[91]Around this time, perhaps to cheer him up, Rocket, Star-Lord and Groot performed a karaoke act.[129]\nBack on Earth,Nick Furyworked asThe Man on the Wall, a protector tasked with taking out threats to Earth in the dark, unseen by others. When someone stole theWatcher's eyes, he asked Fury to murder him. Fury sensed his time was coming, so he assembled a team of potential replacements for his job. He tasked them with finding out who killed the Watcher to prove their worth. Among these chosen few was Gamora. She teamed up withMoon KnightandWinter Soldierto collect clues.\nThe eyes of the Watcher, holding all the secrets he had witnessed, were stolen by the villainOrb, who exposed all the secrets telepathically. This led to Nova having a vision of his dad killing a fellow Nova, so he went to his dad's friend, Rocket. Rocket was busy killing some mercs; he wasn't very good at consoling Sam since he had never consoled someone before. Sam elaborated on his vision; he explained that what he saw was his father's initiation to enter the Black Novas, and he was being led by someone namedAdomox. Rocket recognized Adomox as a bad guy who owed him money. He wanted his units, so he led Nova to the ship-clusterOblitus, where Adomox owned a casino. Rocket proposed entering guns blazing, but Nova was subtler and used Rocket as a furry hat to enter unnoticed. They reached Adomox, so Rocket held off the guards while Nova got his answers. Adomox only gave half answers, but he revealed he'd released poison into the room and Rocket and Nova were infected. If they wanted the antidote, they would have to fetch Adomox a machine that would reprogram his Nova helmet so he could wield the power again.[89]While Nova looked for the machine, Rocket headed to Quainbo to try to find a cure. When the doctors had no answers, he knocked them out. After Nova found out his dad was just pretending to kill that Nova so he could pass his initiation, Rocket visited Cosmo, who controlled Adomox telepathically to force him to give them the antidote. Rocket lived to fight another day.[130]\nOne of the secrets exposed by the Watcher was that Angela was Thor's sister. While Gamora was gone, the Guardians were attacked while jumping in hyperspace by Warpjackers, rich snots who liked the thrill of killing people while they were in warp. They fought them off, but when Angela realized Thor was looking for her she left in the middle of the fight.[131]\nRocket meets the Punisher\nBack with Gamora, Winter Soldier blew up her ship and left her and Moon Knight stranded in space. Gamora called Rocket to rescue them, and together they headed to the satellite where all the candidates were together. Tensions were high as anyone could be the Watcher's killer, but Rocket wasn't intimidated.[132]Eventually, Fury showed up and explained his job and his purpose. In the end, he died in a fight with the person who stole the Watcher's eyes:Dr. Midas. Winter Soldier became the new Man on the Wall, and Rocket and Gamora left, pissed off.[133]\nAfterwards, Gamora assembled the Guardians and forced Star-Lord to reveal how he came back from the Cancerverse. Rocket said he didn't care – the cool thing about the team as they didn't question or judge each other. Star-Lord explained he came back to Earth thanks to the sacrifice of Richard Rider, and tensions rose afterwards.[92]\nA new adventure started when Gamora found the missing Venom and signalled the Guardians to come help her: Venom had lost his mind, the symbiote had taken over the human host. The Guardians arrived and subdued him. They took Flash, Venom's host, to the ship and tried to contain the symbiote, but it broke free and took control of Groot.[134]The beast broke havoc, and Rocket cried as he was forced to shoot his best friend. Eventually, the symbiote let go, but it attached itself to Rocket instead. It was trying to make everyone leave the ship and leave it to it; it wanted to go to the symbiotes' home planet. When Drax touched it, it attached itself to Drax instead.[135]This new form was so powerful it knocked everyone out. It then traveled to the Symbiote planet, on an uncharted part of the galaxy. The symbiotes turned out to be harmless, and they bonded with the Guardians to be able to communicate with them. They explained they were called \"Klyntar\" and were a force of good. They fixed the relationship between Flash and his symbiote and cleansed all the Guardians of any poisons in their organism; they were free to go, feeling relaxed and renewed. Right after they were leaving, they were joined by Captain Marvel, who let them know Star-Lord had been elected as the new king of Spartax.[136]\nWhen Rocket's Earth signal went off again, they headed to Earth to intercept theSilver Surferbefore he entered the planet. It turned out he was just taking ahuman girlback to her parents. In reality, the Guardians were distrustful because Surfer once served Galactus, and wanted to scan him for traces of Galactus' power signature, to know if they had been in contact.[137]\nAn odd incident occured when the Guardians found an EartherS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrierfloating away in space. It turned out to be filled withLife-Model Decoys, robots sent from Earth decades ago who keep hunting Skrulls indefinitely in a never-ending war they didn't know had ended.[138]\nLater, after the Guardians stopped to repair their ship, they ate in a family restaurant. They found a crying kid, 72596. She was upset because she wanted to be friends with the lower castes of her people, but her other friends didn't accept that. The marginalized kid confronted 72596, telling her she was a coward for not daring to be friends. 72596 didn't want to be hated like they hated the lower-class kid. This resonated on all the Guardians, all of which had been bullied in one way or another. They gave a lesson to the children: \"jerks aren't worth impressing, ties forged in cruelty don't last. But true friendship is strong, even for those who have seen little of it in the past. Perhaps for those most of all.\" The two kids agreed to be friends, and the Guardians did a good thing without needing to shoot anybody.[139]\nOne time, Rocket and Groot found a treasure map. It led them to a chest that they traded for coins; later they gambled those coins and won a key, and the key let them unlock a sword. With the sword they slew a giant monster, and they used the monster's eye to light their way to an island surrounded by mermaids. In there they found a floating castle, and within it a riddle. Rocket solved the riddle, and found the final treasure was a surprise birthday party from the Guardians.[140]\nAfterwards, Rocket was ordered by the Galactic Council to pay back all the money he'd stolen from princesses. One of his bounties was to exterminate a herd of lice botheringEgo, the living planet. When he was done, Cosmo called him to Knowhere to pay back his favor from having helped Rocket and Nova with Adomox. Rocket's job was to help a robot calledBrutewho came from a planet of misfit, retired machines. Scavengers had discovered the planet was full of potential profit, so they started abducting the mechs and reprogramming them back into weapons of war. Rocket and Brute, who only talked in binary code, headed to a weapon dealer in Knowhere, and the raccoon was bit irked that he was always fated to work with teammates who couldn't speak coherent sentences. The dealer,Wrapje, told them they could find a robot auction onBaxter Prime. Rocket and Brute busted the auction and freed the robots, and Cosmo paid Rocket.[141]\nRocket and Groot celebrated another adventure inFron, a polar planet. They went for a trip without checking if their drive had expired, so they were forced to make an emergency stop. Suddenly, they were attacked by ice beasts called Nogus, and their weapons were frozen solid. They were saved by a native princess,Jink, but Groot ended up badly hurt. They were taken to the snow natives, who explained Groot has been poisoned and couldn't regenerate anymore. The only antidote was the yolk from the beasts' queen, but it was considered too risky and the mission was forbidden. Rocket cried next to his friend, but he didn't give up. Rocket and Jink went to find theNoguqueen.[142]Jink explained her own mother had died due to the poison, all because her father wouldn't accept sacrificing the many to save the one. They arrived at the queen's lair. The eggs were too big to steal, but they could absorb the yolk out of them. While Rocket was doing that, the beast woke up, so Jink sacrificed herself for Rocket - and then killed the beast from within its belly. They managed to save Groot, and Rocket was accepted as a member of the tribe. As they left, they received a message from the Seer of all Realities: “Rocket should have let Groot die!”[143]\nThey visited the Seer, who saw bad things happening in one reality and stopped them from becoming true in others. Rocket witnessed what would happen if Groot stayed on Earth and joined the Avengers: They would want to use his regenerative abilities to make humans live longer. Once they tried to extract his cells, Groot's body started to fight forhimto live longer. He became a giant, feral monster who destroyed the Earth. In 2046, Iron Man recruited a veteran, jaded Rocket to stop Groot. Rocket and his giant robot sacrificed themselves against Groot, and the power of their friendship restored Groot back to normal. Rocket couldn't believe what the Seer showed him: after his death, he was honored with a statue, finally a hero.[144]\nThe Guardians got caught up in royal drama when Angela stole thenewest daughterofOdinand called the Guardians to help her hide the baby.[145]While hiding, they were attacked by theDísir,Hela's warriors. The heroes defeated them, but the Dísir let it slip that the baby was Asgard royalty and tensions rose. The Guardians didn't know if they wanted to help kidnap a kid. Angela explained the kid must be taken to her realm,Heven, because she'd been cursed with the power ofSurturand could destroy everything.[146]Rocket put Angela through a lie detector and she passed; she only wanted to put the baby through machinery to siphon out the power of Surtur from her. They reached Heven and the Guardians started fighting against its angels, with Rocket fearlessly opening fire against superior godly beings. At the same time, Asgard's army arrived, but Angela convinced her brother Thor that she would die for the baby. Thor agreed to let Angela siphon out the power from the baby. However, she simply threw the kid into Heven's engines.[147]The engines were reignited, bringing Heven to its former glory. The Guardians turned against Angela when they thought she had killed the baby, but she threw herself into the engines and rescued the kid. She was pardoned, and the baby was named Laussa.[148]\nAnother time the Guardians visited Earth, they were shot down by a Chitauri ship led byNebula. They managed to cloak and lose the enemy, but they crashed on New York and attracted the attention of the Avengers. As the Guardians got acquainted with their new roster, the Chitauri came back and an all-out battle started. The enemy stalled for time until they triggered a genetic disrupter, knocking out all of the heroes.[149]Nebula kidnapped Gamora. After they woke up, Rocket revealed he'd slipped a tracking device into the Guardians' food, so he could later find their missing teammate. She was on the other side of the galaxy, on uncharted territory, so they used the Avengers' teleporter,Manifold. They arrived on planetKindun, where Gamora had been sold to be executed. The ruler of the planet, also namedKindun, revealed Thanos had tried to enslave him as a child, so he had plotted all his life to take vengeance on his daughter. Nevertheless, the heroes teleported away.[150]\nAround this time, Rocket let himself be captured by theCollector, a cosmic being who sought to collect unique beings around the galaxy. He wanted to enter his collection to retrieve a Celestial Heart. As it happens, when Celestials die they hearts get turned into power sources, so a planet's survival depended on getting the Heart back. Rocket became cellmate with another anthropomorphic animal,Howard the Duck, and he tried explaining he was going to bust them out, but Howard was too full of spunk to listen.[151]They were singled out and strapped to tables as a Gatherer collected material from them to create clones so they could mate and pass along their oral history. Rocket spit the Gatherer with Azalian acid capsules, helping him and his friend escape. He revealed he'd shaved a map on his belly fur, and also that his acid capsules could reform into computers, so he didn't need to shave his chest anyway. Rocket told his computer to shut down the planet's protective forceweb, letting his fellow Guardians enter. A battle broke out, and things got messier when Rocket told his computer to open all cells. The Guardians collected as many prisoners as they could fit and left, but Howard freaked out about the fact that they were leaving people behind. Rocket promised him they would go back for the rest, but he could tell Howard was speaking out of painful memories. Rocket knew pain, too, so as they dropped him off he told Howard he had to deal with his pain. This wasn't the last time Rocket and Howard would meet.[152]All of this was watched by Mojo of Mojoworld.[153][154]\nLater, Rocket continued paying debt to the princesses; he still owed 120.000 credits. While battling a sea monster, he was called byKlep, a lowlife who claimed to know where to find the Book of Halfworld, somewhere inTower City. Problems arose when the time to pay the Galactic Council ran out, and a warrant was issued for Rocket's capture. Rocket had to escape Cosmo and the Knowhere police, promising he'd turn himself in later.[155]A short time later, Rocket was in Tower City, having stolen the Bible and on the run from the authorities. However, he couldn't open the box holding it. After reaching his ship with Groot, they were boarded by a much bigger ship; the ship of CaptainSale, a female raccoon from Halfworld. Having been fooled by the idea of finding more of his race before, Rocket didn't believe his eyes, but she beat him up. Sale explained he wasn't the only one who couldn't remember, there were many like him out there. Rocket couldn't open the Book because he lacked the key, but Sale had it. Rocket got to read the Bible first, but he just got upset. His past was a mess with toys and clowns and robots and things he couldn't unsee; there were questions that were never meant to be answered. He was done with his past now. He was okay, though; he felt as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. Right as he was leaving, he was arrested again. But that was okay; he was an expert on escaping prisons.[156]\nRocket reads the Halfworld Bible\nAfter Gamora went missing, the Guardians tracked her to New Kral, the gladiator asteroid, and Rocket found a mysterious pink crystal on the way. Gamora was looking for Warlock, who the Guardians believed dead. The Guardians sat as spectators as Gamora and Warlock battled together in the gladiator arena, but the situation was interrupted when Annihilus invaded the Positive Universe once again and all hell broke loose. Annihilus started broadcasting fear, but the Guardians were saved by Pip the Troll's teleporting abilities in the nick of time as the planet fell. Rocket's strong personality clashed with Pip's.\nDue to the Annihilation Wave, the Shi'ar empire declared galactic emergency and invited the Guardians to join a defensive armada with all their past sins to the empire forgiven and forgotten. However, Pip said gathering everyone together would just give Annihilus the chance to destroy them with a single strike. Warlock and Thanos teleported into the ship, seeking to work with the Guardians to take the battle directly to Annihilus. Annihilus was hunting for a mysterious source of energy; when Rocket suggested it might be his crystal, Thanos simply smashed it into a million pieces. Problem was the ship was bugged with Drones, so Annihilus was listening, and the heroes teleported into an ambush. As they were overrun and Annihilus himself appeared, Thanos offered to sacrifice himself so that the rest could escape. But they couldn't escape; Pip's teleportation was jammed. Gamora took a hit, Warlock was captured, and the situation seemed critical. They stumbled upon one of Annihilus' teleportation devices, and if anyone could figure out how to operate it, that was Rocket. The Guardians escaped toStarlin's Bar.[157]Gamora's wound turned out to be much worse than they thought, and they began to lose her; but Warlock's spirit sensed the situation and healed her completely.[158]Later, Thanos and Warlock traveled to the past and stopped the whole crisis from ever taking place; the Guardians carried on with their lives in ignorance.[159]\nAround this time, an event took place that made Rocket hate Earth; they met Spider-Man when they found out he'd been kidnapped by Skrulls. The Skrulls wanted Venom's symbiote, so they would hold Spider-Man hostage until the Guardians arrived. Just as the Guardians predicted, it was a trap and they were ambushed. Still, they were able to defeat the Skrulls and save Spider-Man, who was none the wiser.[160]\nA heartwarming tale took place when the controls for the ship broke down in the middle of an asteroid field, so every Guardian had to work together to fix them; for example, Rocket used a lift from Groot to reach high places of the ship. Right as they fixed it, a new alarm sounded: the incoming ship alert. They were boarded by troll-like aliens. Sometimes it felt like they got out of a jam just to fly into the next one, reflected Rocket. But if crisscrossing the universe fighting bad guys had taught him anything, it was that friendship was unstoppable. That was the real definition of a super team: the people you rely on to overcome the challenges you encounter in your adventures.[161]\nWhile Gamora was in a deep trance, she heard Thanos call Nebula for help through their shared cosmic awareness. Thanos was under trial byEternity,Infinity, theIn-Betweener, and theLiving Tribunal, and recruited Nebula to rescue him. To stop her, the Guardians arrived at an abandoned jump station on the edge of known space, where they faced off against Nebula and Gamora's ex-team, theGraces, composed ofCerise,Death MetalandStellaris. To win the fight, Gamora used her mental bond with Nebula to make her understand Thanos would never love them before striking her down. While they jetted away, Rocket bounced the ship off an asteroid, which broke its toilet. Because the team was too poor to replace it, they decided to steal an out-of-production toilet from the Superpooper Spacewaste company's product archive. To do that, Rocket and Peter let themselves be captured by security guards, whom they distracted by telling their recent adventure, giving time for the rest of the team to steal the toilet and kill the guards. Afterwards, they flew off while being chased by the company's spaceships.[162]\nThe Guardians and the X-Men were gathered when Star-Lord collected theBlack Vortex, a cosmic mirror capable of granting cosmic powers to anyone. He stole it from his father, who was now a bandit calling himself Mr. Knife. Mr. Knife's killers, theSlaughter Lords, came to recover the Vortex, but they were stopped by Gamora after she submitted to the Vortex and underwent a power boost.[163]The heroes teleported away to Spartax's moon, where they started arguing about whether they should embrace the power or destroy it. Rocket seemed to think fearing it was overkill, but after Beast was evolved by the Vortex he started acting strange and zealous. He attackedX-23, a fellow X-Men, when she attempted to destroy the Vortex, so Rocket changed his mind. After Nova arrived.[164]Gamora showed them all a vision of what they could become with the Vortex, and Rocket saw his evolved self.[165]Despite seeing this, Rocket aimed his weapons at the converted ones, who were acting too aggressively. As Iceman was converted as well,Stormand Rocket flew away with the Vortex. Gamora chased them down and fought with her fellow Guardians, ultimately taking the Vortex and leaving the moon. Suddenly, Mr. Knife appeared and his ship blew the moon apart.[166]Rocket survived thanks toKitty Pridetouching him and making him phase, and everyone reunited. They left the moon and met up withCyclopsand the Starjammers, new arrivals.[167]After they found out the Vortex-powered individuals were destroying Hala, the heroes split into teams and Rocket and some others headed to Hala.[168]In there,Ronanthe Accuser submitted himself to the Vortex and gained the power to draw back the aggressors.[169]But the threat was not over: Mr. Knife showed up in his flying fortress and shot the planet until it was literally broken in two.\nVision of a Rocket empowered by the Black Vortex\nAs Rocket's group escaped,Magikof the X-Men teleported Rocket to Gamora's location and the other Vortex-enhanced individuals. Magik and Rocket convinced them to help the rest fight Mr. Knife.[170]By the time they arrived on Spartax, it was too late; Knife had recovered the Vortex and shown it toThane, Thanos's son. Thane used his freezing powers to encase the whole planet in amber, freezing millions. To make things worse,Broodships arrived and began shooting tiny Brood into the planet; the plan was to have these infestoid Brood burrow through the frozen people to their skulls and implant eggs in them, increasing the Brood population by billions. Before the heroes could do anything, the Slaughter Lords arrived and a massive battle began.[171]Meanwhile, Groot submitted to the Vortex and used his newfound powers to give the Vortex back to the good guys.[172]Things came to a halt with the arrival ofGara, an Elder of the universe whose planet was destroyed by the Black Vortex and wanted to spare the universe of it. After she explained the dangers of submitting to the power, Kitty Pryde stepped forward; if they wanted to save Spartax and stop the Brood, she had to accept the power.[173]With it she became one with the universe, and phased all the amber out of the planet, freeing everyone. Once the threat was over, Gara explained they could give back their powers to the Vortex; Groot agreed, but Gamora did not. Afterwards, Star-Lord proposed to Kitty, and everyone celebrated. Storm jokingly told Rocket he could be her date at the wedding.[174]\nAfter this huge event, Rocket was surprised when Nova offered millions of credits for any information on his father's whereabouts, after the kid identified his father, Jesse, as an escaped Chitauri prisoner.[175]Defying the Chitauri backfired when Chitauri lieutenantWarbringerstarted flinging asteroids towards Earth, but Rocket and all of Nova's allies showed up to stop the asteroids and hold the fort while Nova fought Warbringer. Finally, the bad guy was defeated and they rescuedJesse. Rocket greeted his old friend, telling him he hadn't forgotten about the credits he owed him. Never being one for goodbyes, Rocket left quickly.[176]Sadly, it would later turn out that Jesse was a clone and the real one was still missing.\nAround this time, the Guardians were captured by an Interstellar Circus comprised of Saturnalia, Tigrid the Tamer, Hollow-Boned Falkeens and Mekkog, the Living Robot. Saturnalia had developed a calliope whose music siphoned off the energy of their audience, which helped them perform better and increase audience engagement. However, the Guardians were such a big catch that it increased the Circus' appetite. To sate it, they travelled to Earth, where they hypnotized the Avengers with the same methods. Bruce Banner transforming into the Hulk granted the Avengers enough time to free the Guardians. Rocket knocked out Tigrid because he just didn't like cats, and the rest of the Circus fell shortly after. As New York's audience cheered both teams on, Peter felt energized from being set free and got carried away enough to make both teams put on a show for their audience.[177]\nAfter the Watcher died, some of the items in his vault went missing. The Guardians tracked down the Ultimate Nullifier to its potential buyer, the deadly Dannko. He was in planet Ru D'as, and the Guardians took the chance to relax in the saunas while being undercover. Barely dressed, they stumbled upon Dannko and his crew – made of Guardians rip offs – and a fight broke out. Dannko got away and escaped on his ship, so Drax followed him all the way to Earth. Days later, Drax returned after having killed Dannko and returned the Nullifier – and the Guardians were still relaxing in the sauna, lazily.[178]\nLater, Rocket noticed a message on the interstellar merc wires saying Macho Gomez had been captured. Wanting revenge from the time Macho betrayed him, Rocket travelled to Earth, where he met the person who captured Macho, Deadpool, in a secret underground weapons cache in Colorado. They found the place overrun with Drakillars, Rocket's old monsters from Halfworld. The duo met other bounty hunters, but working together they managed to defeat them. They were overrun by Drakillars, but they managed to reach the armory and counter attack. Rocket tried to lead the situation with tactics, but Deadpool wasn't having any of it. In fact, his whole plan against Macho seemed to be badly planned; Deadpool admitted he only started the whole thing because he was bored. Rocket got fed up and attempted to leave; not Macho, nor anybody seemed to want to follow his merc code. Deadpool found it adorable: Rocket was trying to impose order on a crazy world with an obsessive compulsive disorder. Suddenly, Macho found them and captured Rocket. But Deadpool found a teleporter, got Rocket out and set the place to explode. Macho was finished and Rocket headed home.[179]\nAround this time, Rocket was kidnapped byKraven the Hunterwhile buying weapons on Earth, because even though he hated the planet, it was the easiest place to buy guns in. Kraven acted on orders of crazy millionaireShannon Sugarbaker, and she captured Rocket along with several other anthropomorphic animals like Howard the Duck to serve as prey for hunting.[180]If they made it to the southern gate, they would survive. She attacked them with a cosplay suit, using Iron Man's repulsion rays and Thor's hammer. The group knew there was no way they would be let go even if they made it to the exit, and they witnessed hunted preys were buried in the ground, so they deduced there must be an underground tunnel. While they were digging, Rocket distracted Shannon. Thanks to his sacrifice, Howard andSquirrel Girlmade it to the main mansion and freed everyone. Working together, they managed to set the mansion on fire and escape.[181]\nHoping to buy a new piece of Stark Tech, Rocket and Groot decided to put 10 percent of every job into a savings account. They saved up for months, including taking on the job of eliminating techno-roaches called Robopests. However, the Collector desired to preserve them, so he and the Guardians engaged in a fight for the second time. After Rocket knocked Tivan out, he collected his bounty from The Twins and amassed enough for his new toy. However, Groot preserved one of the Robopests inside his skull. Because Peter didn't know how to manage his money as well as Rocket and Groot, he couldn't afford to replace their ship's solar flare shielding, and it caused them to crash on Earth. Luckily, Rocket's emergency savings were enough to cover repairs and his new weapon. The Avengers arrived with the required parts for the ship, but the Robopest inside of Groot adapted to Earth and released a plague of locusts in the middle of the park they were in. After Ant-Man (Scott Lang) removed the Robopest from Groot, Rocket used his newly-acquired pest-exterminator to clear the area. As reward to Ant-Man, Rocket gave him enough money to buyhis daughter Cassiea drum set and start saving for the future. The following week, the Guardians attended Cassie's Battle of the Bands.[182]\nLater, theGuardians of the Galaxyof the year 3000 arrived to try to find out why time was broken in the future. Their arrival in New York caught the present-time Guardian's attention. Rocket called them “copyright infringers” for using the same name; he didn't believe they were from the future and proposed shooting them just to be safe. He remembered they named their team after future Guardians originally, but the members they knew were different. Indeed, time was broken; that was why there were so many contradictions. The two teams went to eat something, celebrating that they avoided the trope of fighting each other. Suddenly, a robot the Guardians 3000 had brought from the future, a Stark, began self-replicating and created an army that attacked the city. The heroes began fighting the robots, and they got unexpected help when the rest of the Guardians 3000 showed up from the future.[183]Among them, an alternate Major Victory who didn't remember his time on the present-Guardians. To avoid further confusion, Starhawk from the Guardians 3000 linked everyone's minds so that everybody could be caught up. They continued fighting the robots; Rocket was very impressed byNikkiof the Guardians 3000 and her weapon expertise; they complimented each other's guns and even tried swapping. The heroes realized the Stark robots were only trying to solve the temporal problem and the time-displaced heroes were the nearest time anomalies, so they masked any trace that they were anachronisms and the fight ended. They followed the Stark to Forest Hills, and Captain Marvel recognized from her time in the Avengers that that was where the villainKorvacused to hide. They went to check Korvac's grave, but he was still dead. They visited Korvac's house, where all the Stark were congregating - but they all had been destroyed. Star-Lord freaked out and tried to call the Avengers, but communications were dead. Two members of the Guardians 3000 went into the house, where they found Korvac, who explained he was dismantling time to rebuild the universe from scratch.[184]The rest of them couldn't enter; an anti-time barrier was raised around the house. To prevent them from breaking it, Korvac reactivated and upgraded the Stark. Rocket thought of reprogramming Star-Lord's phone to project Iron Man's voice, which the Stark robots considered sacred. Everybody started protecting Rocket, but right when he was about to be done, the Guardians 3000 inside the house killed Korvac and time slipped again. Reality shifted, and the Guardians from the present were gone from the scene.[185]\nNext thing they knew, the Guardians were in a bar. Drunk, Rocket called Peter his \"baby boo\" and told him to keep swimming no matter how bad things got,[186]right before Star-Lord was asked to go to Spartax to be their new king. To be able to bring the Guardians with him, he said they were his cabinet and Rocket was his “secretary of raccoon/Spartax relations”. When they were on the planet everyone was given royal treatment, and Rocket enjoyed being bathed by beautiful women. Of course, peace couldn't last and a huge planet appeared on the skyline, shaking the entirety of Spartax.[187]It was Kindun, ruled by the man who'd tried to execute Gamora last time the Guardians met the Avengers. Rocket was pissed off their relaxation was cut short, and as Gamora took the fight to Kindun, the Guardians fought off a Chitauri fleet. They realized the army was a distraction, so they went after Gamora, but by that time she'd already made Kindun leave. Rocket wanted to follow him and blow him up, but the lighthearted mood was broken when Gamora announced she was quitting the team; her connections to Thanos put everybody at risk.[188]\nLater, the Guardians got swept in the Incursions crisis; universes were clashing with each other and being destroyed. The only way to stop it was to destroy the Earths from each universe. To prevent an Incursion, the Galactic Empires decided to destroy 616-Earth, but the Guardians patched into their encrypted security network and heard of this. Rocket was against warning Earth; people who ran towards fire instead of away from it were idiots. Despite this, the Guardians went to Earth, where the heroes told them they wanted to stay and defend their home. Rocket stood next to Earth's mightiest heroes and told them they were idiots for wanting to go down with the ship.[189]The heroes managed to destroy the Galactic fleet, but right afterwards Earth suffered an Incursion: they were invaded byEarth-1610. The Guardians helped shoot down the other universe's helicarriers, but Earth was overwhelmed. A stray beam pierced Rocket's chest, tragically killing him. The two universes collided, and the multiverse was destroyed.[190]\nThe first death of Rocket\nBut that wasn't the end of the story. SupervillainDoctor Doommanaged to achieve godhood and created a patchwork of alternate Earths to carry on with reality. This was calledBattleworld, and Rocket lived on there.\nThis version of the Guardians lived outside of Battleworld, in Knowhere, a satellite floating above it. Drax, Gamora and Rocket got together and made the vow to protect its people. One day, Rocket metYotatwhen he stormed into a bar and killed all of Knowhere's underworld, looking to take control. Yotat noticed Rocket was there and offered him a job, but Rocket just wanted to take out crime, not replace it. They started fighting and Drax came in to help, and eventually even the Nova Corps got involved, a group comprised of previous Guardian of the Galaxy allies: Captain Marvel, Richard Rider, Venom, Iron Man, Moondragon and Warlock.\nLater, Gamora still possessed her Black Vortex augmentations, so she could sense that reality was fake, that Doom was not really a God. She left Knowhere, but crossing the borders was a crime, so Angela of the Thor Corps – Battleworld's police forces – went after her. After fooling Angela, the Guardians visited Mantis to see if she could use her psychic abilities to make Gamora explain herself. However, she remained secretive. Suddenly, the place was obliterated by someone hunting Drax: Yotat.[191]\nRocket in Doom's patchwork universe\nHe wanted revenge on Drax for having humiliated him. The trio of Guardians and Mantis fought him, but Yotat had been empowered by the explosion of a storehouse from the Collector; he was unstoppable, and Mantis was murdered.[192]Yotat dragged the Guardians to the center of Knowhere for a public execution, but this attracted the attention of Angela. This gave Drax a moment to get back in the fight, and the two of them defeated Yotat. The Nova Corps came and picked him up, and that left Gamora to answer to Angela once and for all. She confessed she did not believe in Doom, so Angela began fighting with her for blasphemy. Their fight was interrupted by the sudden appearance ofHalathe Accuser.[193]She killed Angela and defeated the Nova Corps; the Guardians had to swarm her all at once to defeat her. Gamora cried over her body, trying to understand all these names rattling in her head, people she somehow knew: Groot, Thanos, Peter. Suddenly, Star-Lord showed up: he'd survived the destruction of the multiverse in a life raft that passed over to Battleworld. He recruited the Guardians for a final attack against Doom so that things could go back to normal. Rocket understood that that whole reality was a lie, so the Guardians signed up.[194]Later, Doom was overthrown and the Multiverse was assembled again.[195]Things went back to the way they were: Star-Lord as the emperor of Spartax, Gamora missing from the team and Rocket and Groot seemingly shot to death.\nRocket posing as Lord Rakzoon\nAfter they woke up in their reality once again, Rocket carved a map in Groot's wood and disappeared. Groot didn't reunite with the Guardians, setting off to find Rocket. As time passed, in Star-Lord's absence his fiancée Kitty became the new Star-Lord and the team accepted a new member from Earth:The Thing. Meanwhile, Groot followed his map to Knowhere and Cosmo and then to Earth's superheroes: Iron Man,Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Howard the Duck - periodically carving up his body to refresh the tattoos so that they wouldn't get erased. Over eight months Groot visited dozens of planets and completed several quests to get to the following clue. It didn't seem to be leading anywhere, until he spotted Rocket on TV, calling himself Lord Rakzoon; the new dictator of the Yon quadrant, laying waste to the peace that had held the region together. Groot hired a postal device to deliver himself to Lord Rakzoon, hoping to recover his memories.[196]Rakzoon sent Groot to the dungeons, where he listened to his story, but he said he was gonna kill him anyway.[197]Then all of the sudden Rakzoon started laughing, and he said: “Gotcha!” Rocket never lost his memories; he was just getting payback for the time Groot made him follow a treasure map only to celebrate his birthday. It was an eight months long prank. Once the royal guard realized they were lied to, Rocket and Groot had to fight their way out. Suddenly, they were faced withNasoj, the previous ruler of the Yon quadrant, which Rocket had imprisoned. He was freed by the Postal service Groot sent there:Pockets Possumand his friendShrub, who claimed to be the best at escaping prisons. Rocket and Groot butted heads with these copycats, but Nasoj ordered to kill them all. The four guys escaped to the port, but Rocket and Groot stole Pockets' ship, so the couriers swore vengeance. Rocket returned to the Guardians, who were celebrating a funeral for Rocket and Groot, and shot an empty coffin into space. Right then Rocket showed up, and the team couldn't believe their eyes.[198]Without Peter in the team, Rocket became the new leader and addedThe Thingand Kitty Pride to their roster. Rocket, Groot, Drax and Venom were present when Kitty answered a call from Peter, only to tell him she was upset Peter hadn't visited her or the Guardians and also forgot about Kitty's birthday.[199]\nRocket and Groot argue with their counterparts, Pockets and Shrub\nWhen the Guardians went to visit Knowhere for a supply run and to teach The Thing the ropes, they met gangster Yotat causing trouble. They started fighting until theKnowhere Corpscame in: a police force made of Mantis, Moondragon, Bug, Cosmo and a newcomer namedPrism. They took care of arresting Yotat.[200]Rocket and the Guardians later fought an army of droids.[201]\nAs the new Leader, one of Rocket's first adventures was to take Groot to Earth: Groot wanted to see a human he'd rescued from his home planet many years ago. On their way, their ship broke down, and they were forced to hitch-hike. They were picked up by a space-truck, but this in turn was attacked by space-sharks; Rocket hated the idea of the trip, but he got to have fun when shooting sharks. However, the truck left them stranded, so they were forced to hitch-hike again. This time they were picked up by Skrulls pretending they were humans. They argued among themselves too much, so Rocket and Groot just stole one of their pods and escaped. While resting in a bar, the two friends discussed how there wasn't anyone like them out there. Maybe that's why Rocket didn't want to visit Earth; everyone looked the same, and it made him feel even more different. But if Groot was different too, Rocket would take different over normal any day. Rocket and Groot tried and swapped ships several times, until they were spotted by a bounty hunter army looking for Groot. Rocket couldn't believe Groot had a higher bounty than him, but he sacrificed himself so that Groot could escape and tell everybody what happened. Only problem was Groot couldn't talk.[202]Groot didn't manage to get through to anyone, so he just headed towards Rocket.[41]Meanwhile, Rocket woke up imprisoned by the bounty hunterEris, who was using him as bait to capture Groot. Groot showed up with a pack of friends he made along the way, but they were ineffectual and Eris made Groot explode. She prepared to shoot Rocket out of the airlock, but Groot had survived in his tiny form.[203]Groot rescued his friends, and together they turned things around and escaped Eris.[204]Later, they finally reached Earth and completed a bucket list of things Groot wanted to do: listening to Star-Lord's favorite bands, watching Captain Marvel's favorite movies, fighting supervillains, partying with the X-Men. Jean Grey of the X-Men was able to telepathically guide Groot to the human he wanted to find, and so he was finally able to reconnect with his old friendHannah.[205]\nLater, Rocket and Groot did a little bounty job on Earth: they had to findHorgon Lokumfrom Florix. It was Halloween, and Horgon was hiding among costumed kids. When the kids saw Rocket and Groot, they thought they were costumes as well; they loved Groot, but they weren't impressed by Rocket. Horgon revealed himself and fled to a graveyard, where he revealed his minions: an army of mind-controlled, armed children. Rocket decided he hated Earth too much for those risks and he and Groot ran to fight another day.[206]\nRocket finally stepped up as leader of the Guardians when they stopped a magical cult from activating a bomb. The bomb was more magic than tech, so Rocket hadn't got a clue how to disarm it; he decided to separate the team for a little while so that he and Groot could take the bomb to people who know how to disarm them. Drax didn't know what to do with his little vacation; his only pastime was killing Thanos. Rocket tried to change his mind, but he knew it was pointless. He gave Drax a ship he had stashed for emergencies, theSpace Sucker— a rusty piece of garbage. And so, everyone went their separate ways.[207]\nLater, while escaping from Bounty Hunters Rocket and The Thing crashed their ship into a gladiator planet. The planet worshipped Earth's wrestling industry, and they considered Thing a hero due to his wrestling days. They made him wrestle aliens day after day, while Rocket assembled the parts they got as rewards and attempted to rebuild their ship. Rocket couldn't stand to watch Thing get punched every day; he wanted to intervene, but Thing said to give him a chance. He fought all the challengers at once, but he was overrun. Rocket jumped in with his guns, getting everyone's attention. The planet worshipped wrestling because it was the only broadcast they could receive; but Rocket was able to build a transmitter and radio to bring them 900,000 channels. The citizens calmed down and welcomed their new distraction, giving the Guardians time to wait and be rescued.[208]\nWhen Rocket found Drax's room trashed, he began tracking his teammate by following his trail of trashed bars; Drax seemed filled with rage. In the Broken Empire Rocket met theSpaceknights, whom he'd considered a myth. They explained Drax had left with one of their teammates, and they tracked their ship to Hool, a planet infected with Durgh, a species that lured people in with their dreams. In Hool, people saw what their hearts wanted to see, so Rocket saw it full of adorable things like Teddy bears and cartoon dragons. By the time they broke into the Durgh's fortress, Drax had already freed himself from his dream projection. When they got back to the ship, Drax revealed he had been so filled with rage because it was the anniversary of the marriage he'd once had. Rocket promised Drax to take him out next year.[209]After Rocket's encounter with the Spaceknights, they trained him.[90]\nLater, Rocket and Groot were looking for someone to buy them forty-eight tons of Zunk in Xarth Three's bar Leery's. A group of badoon arrived, searching for a strayRigellian Recorder, and when they found he was hiding in the bar, violence broke out. Rocket wanted to mind his own business, but he knew the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil was for good men to do nothing, so he protected the Rigellian, who didn't even remember what vital information he had recorded. As they escaped the Badoon, Xarth gladiators andSakaarmonsters, they found a victim of the mayhem, a Zunk trader who was looking to move exactly forty-eight tons, a terrible irony. They began escaping from one galactic empire after another, first in their jump freighter “White Stripe”, then in a stolen, sentient Nova Corps ship. They escaped from the Badoon, the Nova Corps, aGaladoranSpaceknight, KreeAccusers,Kree Sentries, and the Shi'ar Imperial Guard before realizingRecorder 127came from the Timely, Inc. corporation in planet Alpha Centauri. By this point, they had been joined by Gamora, who was actually hired byAnnihilusof the Negative Zone to capture the Recorder. She quickly turned around when it became clear the Recorder was sought because he was vital for the completion of Project 616, which seemed capable of controlling the multiverse. The Guardians couldn't be immoral mercenaries about this.[210]\nThanks to a cloaking device fromPip the Trolland Rocket's knowledge from having worked in Timely Inc. before, they were able to infiltrate its building and reach the secret room that held Project 616. They learned the corporation had kidnapped every Recorder they could find to download their knowledge and map out the entire knowledge of the universe. Their primary objective was to make better marketing, but at its full power, it could reshape reality. Recorder 127 was all that was missing. As security guards overpowered Rocket, Gamora and Groot and forced 127 to join the Project, every empire that followed Rocket reunited in the planet, plus the Universal Church of Truth. A massive war broke out, the Recorder was assimilated and the Project was completed. But 127 decided to send the Power Cosmic to Groot, whom he had grown to trust. Groot used it to stop the conflict, sending everyone home, bringing back the dead, destroying the project and preventing anyone from remembering how to build it again.[210]\nThe Galadorian Spaceknight, Roamer, was touched by the heroism he witnessed and decided to stop being a mercenary and turn to good deeds again. The Badoon War Brotherhood Commander, Droook, swore revenge on Rocket, and Sharnor the Kree Accuser was equally inconvenienced. Nova Centurion Grekan Yaer and Shi'ar Imperial Guard Guardsman Ebon, however, respected the raccoon. The Guardians said good-bye to the Recorder, who would never forget them.[210]\nDuring a night off, Kitty tricked Rocket into thinking the others would come to a bar so that they could hang out, just the two of them. She wanted a chance to bond, to build trust. Suddenly, Maxor, a kree, burst in asking for protection; he was deserting from the government. They agreed to help him for the profit. They left the bar, but they were attacked by the Kree. While protecting Maxor, Kitty discovered he was actually a Skrull. He revealed he was working undercover, but he went native and couldn't bring himself to destroy the Kree. So the people following him were actually Skrulls, and they took them down. When Kitty turned around, Maxor had shape-shifted into Rocket; Kitty didn't know who to shoot. Maxor claimed he was tired and she should just shoot him, but this tipped Kitty off. Rocket never stopped fighting, especially for his friends. The real Rocket was discovered, and the two friends discovered they knew a lot about each other after all.[211]\nRocket was flying with Groot and Drax when they found a gigantic structure in space. Rocket figured if something so big poked into our universe it had to contain something valuable, so he convinced his teammates to board it and raid it. They found an ancient scripture, and Rocket was the only one capable of reading the ancient Gramosian; it seemed to say the place was a tomb. Suddenly, they met the Guardians 3000, but they said they were in the year 3016; one of the two teams must have traveled in time. The only explanation was the structure lay outside of time and space; both teams entered it in different eras but ended up in the same place. The heroes were suddenly attacked by a group of armored assailants capable of self-repairing. It was too much for the good guys, so they retreated through a door that turned out to be another entry point; they were transported to Earth in the year 1016. Then the impossible happened: a third team of Guardians of the Galaxy showed up, theGuardians 1000.[208]After an obligatory misunderstanding fight, the Guardians 1000 introduced themselves: They wereStella Nega,Aerolite,Astrolabe,Tua Zonthe Colonizer andSkytower. They explained they were fighting the Newcomers of the giant structure, which plundered worlds of goods and life forms. The populations they harvested were turned into genetic stock to be gene-cruited, recycled into serving the enemy as highbreed. The Guardians 3000 lostCharliein the structure, and it was possible he'd been turned into one of them. Suddenly, the three teams were attacked by Newcomers highbreeds. The Guardians didn't dare use lethal force in fear one of the enemies might be Charlie, but this costed them Skytower, who was captured and gene-cruited. In his rage, Astrolabe lost control of the star he held within him and the whole place exploded.[209]As his last act, Astrolabe managed to protect the Guardians from the explosion. Afterwards, they found the Newcomer portal still active, so they went into the structure, where they were amazed by the sheer size of the place and its armies. They found more scriptures: it seemed the structure was built to worshipHermetikus. Before they could find out more, they were attacked by thousands of Highbreeds.[212]\nRocket with his brain removed\nFaced with certain doom, Rocket analysed what each member brought to the group; he was a tactical genius, the main reason he made the cut for his team was his tactical smarts. He was looking for an angle, a miracle play, but he couldn't find any. Then Astrolabe showed up; he hadn't died, he had just teleported away. He teleported again, taking everyone to safety. Astrolabe's star entangled with the structure and established a line of communication; it began a dialogue. The group was able to find out that the structure was a trans-time location assembling an army from thousands of worlds across the timestream in service of their master Hermetikus. Astrolabe convinced them to attempt a peaceful negotiation, but that just led to them being imprisoned by Hermetikus. Only Rocket wasn't in a cage; he was being scanned by Hermetikus, who found out Rocket's brain was unique and wanted it for his collection.[213]\nEvery Guardian except for Rocket and Stella Nega was taken away. Hermetikus wanted Rocket's brain for his tactical genius; he had a collection of brains he connected to his suit to be the ultimate being. He also knew Stella, back from when he was called Tyreeze Tarolt and was a member of her Guardians. He wanted to take the concept of the Guardians to the next level; to guard all of infinity. Meanwhile, Vance Astro used his telekinesis to release Nikki from her cell. Back with Hermetikus, he painlessly extracted Rocket's brain and left him in a vegetative state.[211]Rocket was able to keep talking from his brain, which Hermetikus connected to his suit hivemind to work in strategic planning. As punishment to his previous strategic commander,Korz, he inserted him in Rocket's old body. Stella convinced Korz that Hermetikus was a psychopath who would kill him next, so Korz helped her escape.[214]Stella headed to Hermetikus, claiming she wanted to join him, while Korz released the Guardians. Hermetikus explained he would attack the capital worlds of thirty-seven empires or species, and Rocket had already perfected the assault plan for him. Hermetikus knew the Guardians had been released, but it didn't matter; he launched his invasion.[215]However, Rocket never opened the shields; so all the ships were accelerating towards a solid wall and crashing. By giving Rocket authority, he gave him the chance to usurp control, to gain autonomy. He controlled Hermetikus' body now. Hermetikus managed to disconnect Rocket's brain, but right then the Guardians showed up. While they distracted the bad guys, Rocket deactivated the highbreed system. He might have been disconnected, but he could still access the WiFi. Charlie of the Guardians 3000 and all the converted Guardians were back to normal; the army was no longer. Rocket was put back in his body and Hermetikus was reduced to a brain. He might have perverted the founding concept of the Guardians of the Galaxy: universal peace, but the dream still remained, and every team, in its own time, could fight for it. A question remained unanswered, about who founded the concept of the Guardians of the Galaxy since there had been a team like that as far back as the year 1000.[216]\nWhen Rocket was captured along with Howard the Duck by the Collector, he took gene samples of both of them to be cloned for reproduction. He used the samples to create female clones. Later, these female clones escaped and reunited with Howard to go back to the Collector and free all the other prisoners that had been left behind. Things got complicated when the whole universe started chasing Howard after it was discovered he was the Nexus Between Worlds, capable of teleporting anyone anywhere. For safety, he teleported his friends to the Guardians of the Galaxy's ship, and Rocket met his cloneShocket.[217]Howard reached the Guardians, but right after that he was captured by the Collector.[218]The Guardians landed on the Collector's planet and started taking out his guards and freeing the prisoners, antagonizing him for the third time. The prisoners went home by touching Howard and getting teleported instantly, but the Collector wouldn't have it and the Guardians couldn't stop him. In the end, Howard touched him and teleported him away. Four hours later, the planet had been emptied. Shocket and theHoward cloneexited reality through Howard.[219]\nLater, the Guardians cordoned off a road from all traffic to allow passage for a Gamarvian turtle migration. This pissed off a space trucker with a deadline, so he rushed past the blockage and accidentally lost some of his cargo, a box containingTsum Tsumaliens. The box floated away until it ended up on Earth and that was the last the Guardians heard of it.[220]\nThe Guardians went near Earth for a pitstop for supplies in the A.F.S.S., theAlpha FlightSpace Station. While Rocket was taking things – stealing them, you might say – he bumped into ex-Guardian Captain Marvel, who was now leading Alpha Flight. Rocket was surprised to hear the Captain would be taking a desk job; she should be out there kicking butt with the Guardians.[221]Carol later called Rocket to ask for help: she was being attacked bySatorivessels. Sadly, Rocket told her the Guardians were too far away to be able to reach her in time. The Captain had to figure it out by herself.[222]\nWhen the Guardians stole from the Chitauri, they were chased by one of their fleets so they destroyed it. They didn't even know what the package was; they just saw the Chitauri had it so it must have meant bad news. After getting it, they were scared it might be dangerous, so they decided to bring it to experts. Problem is, the only one they knew was Peter Quill, who was now emperor of Spartax. They visited the planet, but Rocket was against visiting; he felt Peter betrayed them by abandoning the team. Right as they arrived, Gamora fell from the skies, hurt. She tried to stop Hala the Accuser, but she had arrived in Spartax.[223]Hala blamed the Guardians for the destruction of planet Hala, so she wanted revenge. Rocket recognised her from their time in Battleworld, but he refered to those memories as a dream. Hala was too powerful and knocked everybody out; while Peter was out, Hala took him to her ship. She wanted to destroy Spartax while Peter was still alive to watch and feel her pain, and then she'd turn to Peter's other home planet, Earth.[224]Down on the planet, Kitty was the first to wake up, so she hid all of her teammates. After they recovered, they tried to get to Peter, but Hala had destroyed all the ships. Rocket rebuilt their ship and they left, but Hala saw them; Gamora had to sacrifice herself so the ship could get high enough to cloak. By the time Hala reached her ship, the Guardians had already grabbed Peter.[225]The Guardians argued amongst themselves about whether they should go back for Gamora: Rocket felt it was too dangerous to go back without a plan, but Peter made himself heard. It was bad enough Kitty had subtly taken the lead since Hala appeared; now Peter was giving orders again, undermining Rocket's leadership. They went back, all the Guardians attacked together and Hala was subdued. Right as they were catching their breath, though, Yotat the Destroyer of Destroyers appeared.[226]Working together, the Guardians took him down. After the crisis was over, the Spartax government held Peter accountable for the destruction of the planet and he was fired from his position. No longer a king, Peter returned to the Guardians, who were now enemies of the galaxy.[200]\nLater, Rocket, Peter and Kitty answered a distress signal from the Brood that terrified them. After arguing which one of them was closer to Ripley, the main character from Alien, they found the place littered with bodies, and decided to split up. It turned out the people in that ship were raided and impregnated by the Brood, but the Brood had been infected by maggots that turned you into alien hybrids on contact. Rocket set a twenty-minute timer on the ship, and discovered the crew hadn't send the distress signal; they had stranded their ship to keep the parasite from getting out. Peter grabbed the only survivor, who was pregnant from the Brood, and helped her give birth. Meanwhile, Kitty encountered the Brood queen, and Rocket came to her rescue. They escaped and the ship self-destructed. As they were leaving on their ship, the woman they rescued turned out to be infected, but Rocket blew her up.Hewas the damn Ripley.[216]\nRocket's second death\nOn another occasion, Rocket and Groot were invited to a mysterious mansion on Earth along with a series of bizarre characters:Spider-Ham, Squirrel Girl and her squirrelTippy-Toe, The Punisher,Forbush Man,Ant-Manand Howard the Duck. They were invited by Deadpool andhis wife, because Deadpool was blackmailing each of them: he knew Rocket and Groot had programmed the Shi'ar's flagship computer to use profanity on every sentence. After getting beaten up, Deadpool explained he just wanted the funniest characters in comic books together for a Christmas card photo. They turned the lights off for the photo, but when the lights turned back on again, Forbush Man was dead.[227]After the funeral, Deadpool decided he would solve the mystery; he'd put a tracker on everybody who was at the mansion. He and Squirrel Girl tracked Rocket and Groot to the Muir Woods in San Francisco by using a teleporter. Rocket said he wasn't the one who did it in that twelve-person group, but Groot argued there were thirteen people at the mansion. Suddenly, the group encounteredSquirrelpool, a crazy mix-up of Squirrel Girl and Deadpool created when the teleporter they used mixed their DNA.[228]They subdued the monster and Deadpool and Squirrel Girl left, but right after they left, a mysterious figure showed up and murdered Rocket and Groot.[229]Later, Deadpool went back to the mansion and summoned the one responsible for all the killings: a demon from his wife's realm,Paen-Umbra. The demon was trying to win the love of Deadpool's wife. He cut off the demon's crotch and forced him to bring back all the dead, including Rocket.[230]\nWhen Squirrel Girl accidentally created an evil clone of herself, this clone went around defeating every superhero. Squirrel Girl assembled a group of friends to stop her clone: amongst them was Rocket Raccoon. Even with his help, they seemed to not stand a chance against the clone Squirrel Girl, so the real one picked upMjolnirand summoned every hero on Earth. Together they stopped the clone and sent her to the Negative Zone.[231]\nAfter visiting a weapon convention on Earth, Rocket was passing throughCentral Parkwhen he saw Tippy-Toe fighting villainPlantmanand decided to help her. Plantman gave the trees intelligence and used them to attack the people, but he lost control of his puppets and got cast aside. Rocket felt a serious emotional conflict at having to shoot trees, considering his best friend was one of them. He and Tippy-Toe decided to run. Things seemed desperate, until Tippy-Toe found Rocket talking to the trees; he could talk tree. By talking, they understood the trees were just angry that Plantman had forced them to move right when they were getting ready to go dormant for Winter. Working together, they managed to arrest Plantman. Rocket told Tippy-Toe they should do that again sometime.[232]\nRocket visited Earth to play Dungeons and Dragons with Earth's heroes, but Iron Man just wouldn't follow the rules; he acted like it was too lame for him. Instead, he left to play Fantasy Football. Rocket and Iron Man argued over what was the better game, so Iron Man dared him to last through only one game of Fantasy Football. The game would be held in Glaxion 9, so while they were travelling Rocket studied all the statistics in the game, thinking it was a math game. When they arrived, however, it turned out to be very much real football. Rocket was outpowered against giants, but he wouldn't back out. Making things worse, the game would last forty quarters. Rocket was beaten to a pulp, until he realized you were supposed to do everything you wanted to win, so he started shooting his opponents. In the last play of the day, he got his revenge against Iron Man by stealing a Wizard's staff and summoning a demon, essentially rolling a D20 from Dungeons & Dragons in real life. Iron Man ended up scorched. Rocket won the bet, and Iron Man was forced to play Dungeons & Dragons as a humiliating little bunny character.[233]\nRocket and Groot were taking a day off in a vacatiocube when they were interrupted byGunhildof the Elmhold clan, who destroyed their virtual reality. She and her Vikings were there to retrieve the Bardonx, a mysterious box Rocket had won in a card game. But the king wanted the person who stole it as well, so Rocket and Groot were taken to Gunhild's planet. The king had a nefarious reputation, but when he saw Groot he took him for Elmhold's God and treated him with all his hospitality. Rocket, meanwhile, was thrown in prison with Gunhild. She explained the king wasn't stupid; he was just using Groot and he was going to sacrifice him so his people would think he was powerful. Rocket and Gunhild escaped prison and saved Groot right before he was going to be thrown into a volcano, freeing the Elmhold clan from its tyrannical king. Rocket and Groot flew away, but they ended up stranded in the sea, half burnt; at least they finally got the vacation they wanted.[234]\nLater, Rocket and Groot competed on several games on Knowhere, but Groot won in each of them. Rocket took things one step further and arranged a cosmic car race. While they were racing, Rocket received a call from GeneralDock, who told him his people were under attack by thekiffsso he was calling in the favor Rocket owed him. Not wanting to cancel the race, they simply changed the finish line to Olim Seven, their destination planet. Even then, they couldn't agree if the finish line was the atmosphere or the ground, so they challenged each other to see who killed more Kiffs. Their killing was so intense, Rocket and Groot put an end to 1000 years of war in the planet. They were celebrated as heroes, but their bet ended in a tie. The games would never end.[235]\nRocket and Groot took a group of scouts from different races on a camping to theHumpaloof Foreston the planet of Juxx. During a campfire, Rocket told scary stories, then he told the youngsters to go to bed. However, one of them asked for one last story. Since Rocket was in no mood to tell another, Groot stepped up and told the kids of the adventure he and Rocket had to find a treasure. However, all the kids heard Groot say was \"I am Groot\". One of the scouts started to applaud, a small kid that was seemingly from a plant-like race had understood Groot's words perfectly well.[140]In the excitement, Rocket proceeded to tell the kids about his ruse as Lord Rakzoon,[236]his game of intergalactic football,[233]his encounter with the Elmhold Clan[234]and the time he and Groot nearly drove the Kiffs to extinction, until the kids just wanted to be allowed to sleep.[235]\nWhile Rocket and Groot were fighting a space squid, Rocket got a call: his old friend Frankie Fat Hands had died. Rocket said he didn't care and wouldn't go to the funeral, but he trashed an entire room; his feelings were clear. In the end, he and Groot attended the funeral. Later, they visited Frankie's tombstone, where Rocket apologized for not having said anything during the funeral. Suddenly, Frankie showed up, digging his way up from the grave. He had faked his death. They went to a restaurant to celebrate and, while leaving, Rocket accidentally pushed Frankie out of the train and killed him. While they were being interrogated by the police, Rocket spotted Frankie outside, so he escaped. Confronting Frankie, he admitted he had to fake his death again. He then choked on what he was eating, dying again. So began a long series of fake deaths, until Rocket lost his patience and warned Frankie he'd kill him himself. Under pressure, Frankie admitted he owed a lot of money to a gangster named TheSlug. Rocket agreed to help, but when they went to pick Frankie up, they found him dead - for real this time, killed by The Slug. Angry, Rocket and Groot took the fight to the gangster. However, it turned out Slug was a philanthropist, a do-gooder. It was all a trick from Frankie to break into the Slug's vault, and he was in cahoots with the police. As Frankie was leaving, Rocket only had one thing to say: “I love you.” He couldn't bring himself to hate Frankie, no matter what. Frankie's had taught him everything he knew. Suddenly, the squid they had been fighting fell from the sky and killed Rocket. In his anger, Groot knocked out the bad guys and nobody got away. Then, as he was leaving in his ship, Groot found Rocket, who had simply faked his death.[33]\nCaptured by an Earther satellite from the oil companyRoxxon, Rocket got infected with Space Rabies, or more accurately, R.A.B.I.E.s; Robotic Antibody/Bacterial Infection Engines, a new breed of nanobots. Being controlled against his will, Rocket was sent crashing to Earth, to Howard the Duck's car. Rocket had lost his mind and turned feral. Deadpool was sent there to investigate on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s orders, but Rocket bit Deadpool's teleporter, causing it to explode. After the smoke cleared out, it turned out the explosion caused Howard and Deadpool to fuse.[237]This new Deadpool the Duck picked up Rocket and they hit the “return” button on his ship, hoping to find the origin of his rabies. The ship took them to the Roxxon satellite. A janitor told them there used to be all kinds of shady experiments going on there, but the taxes were too high so they were moved to another base.[238]After fighting the security, Ms.Basalt, Deadpool went back to Earth and started busting Roxxon bases, looking for Rocket's experiment. He finally found the Rabies project in “The World”, an artificial island in theUnited Arab Emirates. There was a mysterious tank labeled “RABIEs” so they just put Rocket inside. Meanwhile, Basalt was also back.[239]While Rocket was in the tank, a fight broke out between Deadpool, Basalt, some Roxxon agents, and some newly-arrived S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. In the midst of this chaos, Rocket exited the tank, good as new. He put an end to the fighting. S.H.I.E.L.D. explained the rabies were nanobots, and Rocket realized he was made to bite Deadpool's teleporter on purpose, by design of the supervillain who was called as a consultant by Roxxon:Doctor Bong. This old obscure villain of Howard the Duck was obsessed with creating animal-human life, so he intended to fuse Howard with Deadpool all along.[240]Deadpool and Howard wanted to go back to their bodies, but they had puked when they first fused, so now they had to eat their puke back, because that was where the RABIEs nanobots were. This was too much even for Rocket, who couldn't watch. When Doctor Bong showed up, everyone ganged up on him, Rocket included. The villain was defeated, and Howard and Deadpool went back to normal.[241]\nThe bounty hunterDeath's Headcaptured the Guardians in Knowhere, planning to sell them to the highest bidder. He placed them in sleeping pods that showed them a reality where their biggest dreams had come true to keep them sleeping. As the Guardians realized it must be too good to be true and snapped out of it, they got together and jumped onto Rocket's vision: a world where he was king and he was worshipped by Halfworld animal ladies. Rocket had already realized it was a vision, but he had everything he wanted, so he didn't care. Star-Lord tried to convince him he didn't have everyone he wanted. Rocket was forced to admit he missed Groot, so he decided to wake up. As they woke up, Rocket realized they were in Death's Head's ship, whom he called one of the universe's best bounty hunters. Death's Head found them and they started fighting, but Rocket threw Death's Head into one of his sleeping pods, where the villain started seeing his dream reality. While he slept, the Guardians borrowed one of his shuttles and set his autopilot to redirect him to a particularly nasty sector of the Chitauri empire. All that was left was for Rocket to wipe any trace of their bounty from the computers, but first he decided to jump into the sleeping pods a bit longer, to live the dream.[242]\nRocket's secret heart is exposed\nLater, the Guardians had a group meeting to discuss their financial problems. They had huge debts to which they all had contributed; some as a group, like damages to Starlin's Bar during bar fights, some as individuals, like Rocket buying 2000 credits of explosives. Altogether they owed more than 200,000 credits. Luckily, Knowhere cops offered them a job:Deacon Delcario, a Ravolian monk, needed a escort home. He'd just retrieved one of his church's most holy relics: theMother Stone, worth a small fortune. If the Guardians could make sure it wasn't stolen, all of their debt would be lifted. As they traveled, the deacon asked that no more than five souls be allowed near the Mother Stone; more people would cause a catastrophe that would bring about the end of the universe. Suddenly, the Deacon died from a mysterious psychic attack. At the same time, Pip The Troll teleported into the ship to steal the stone — but it activated.[243]The Guardians and Pip found themselves teleported inside the Stone, where a being namedMother Entropyintroduced herself. She explained they were to undergo a test to determine who was more worthy of hosting a transference to become this dimension's Mother Entropy; an entire reality teleporting into ours. They each faced visions of their worst fears; Rocket found himself surrounded by other Rockets, making him freak out about not being the only one of his kind anymore. As the test ended, Mother declared she needed further testing, so she made everybody swap bodies; Gamora and Rocket switched.[244]Amidst their confusion, they were teleported to Starlin's Bar, where a bar fight broke out. The heroes couldn't manage their bodies, so they were overwhelmed. Suddenly, they were back inside their ship, back in their original bodies. Mother Entropy chose Pip to host her; he was the one who lacked empathy the most. Rocket wondered why he wasn't picked, but Entropy explained he secretly held affection for two of his fellow Guardians; Groot and somebody else.\nAs Pip was granted the Mother Stone, he was covered by leaves and became the host for Entropy; his only instinct became to cover the entire universe in what he called the ultimate tranquillity. He barfed all over the Guardians to infect them, but they managed to open their ship and throw Pip into space. Mother Entropy, still a projection, explained their efforts were meaningless; the transition had succeeded thousands of times in countless universes. Pip wasn't killed, he simply fell into Shi'ar Prime. The Guardians landed on the planet, only to find themselves received by Gladiator, the emperor of the Shi'ar.[245]The Guardians tried to warn the authorities, but Gladiator simply imprisoned them because of their past warrants. As Gladiator visited them in jail, Pip appeared in the room. He infected Gladiator, who freed the Guardians as his last action. The team ran to their ship, but Rocket stayed behind; he was infected too. As Rocket stayed in Shi'ar Prime, the rest of the universe began getting infected, because Pip could teleport.[246]Unexpectedly, the Guardians returned to the planet; Groot had a plan. He used his branches to dig into the leaves of Pip's body and dig out the Mother Stone; this stopped the connection. Everyone who was infected returned to normal, and the Guardians left. However, Knowhere wouldn't believe the Guardians' story, so they still had their debts. Luckily, Groot cut open the Mother Stone, and it was filled with precious gems. Everything turned out nice and dandy, but Rocket refused to answer who was the second Guardian he cared about; it was his secret heart.[247]\nAround this time, Peter and Kitty broke up. To avoid living somewhere where she ran into her ex every time she got out of the shower, Kitty went to help the Kymellians with their farming project. But game nights weren't the same without Kitty, so Rocket tried to convince her to come back, maybe talk things over with Peter. But no; things between them were over.[248]Rocket went back to the ship unfulfilled; he just wanted to know why they broke up. It might be none of his business, but he was emotionally invested; he was supposed to officiate the wedding.[249]He didn't know this, but Peter and Kitty simply grew apart after he became emperor of Spartax and stopped living in the Guardians' ship. Rocket received an emergency transmission from Peter; he and Kitty were captured by the Collector, the fourth time they'd made contact. Rocket and Groot went to pick them up.[199]\nFor a month, Groot became weaker and regenerated more slowly. When space debris was going to destroy a planet, the Guardians rescued the Kree political prisoners that weren't evacuated. After dropping them off in theKyln, the unexpected happened: They saw another Groot was being brought in, not another Flora Colossus, but a duplicate of Groot. They tried to interrogate it, but a riot broke out and the Groot ended up blasted away. One of the prisoners explained the Collector had been paying anyone who could give him info about any Flora Colossi; he wanted to buy one. The Guardians thought Groot's weakness was linked to these duplicates, so they set out to find the Collector. As this was their fifth meeting, Tivan welcomed them in. He owned four Groots in a beautiful garden full of Earth raccoons, and admitted he created the duplicates. He grabbed one of Groot's splinters after a Guardians battle and tinkered with it until it managed to regenerate. Problem was, his assistant Kiya ran away with the specimen, and she used it to create several other duplicates to sell. The Collector agreed to give them the Groots if they retrieved his DiMavi assistant. The youngest Groot duplicate gave the Guardians the location where he was sold, where they found Kiya. Gamora captured the green lady, but when looking at her closely, she realized she wasn't DiMavi — she was Zen-Whoberian, like Gamora. Instead of capturing her, they rescued her away from the Collector. She explained she was a half breed, the daughter of a DiMavi and a male Zen-Whoberian who was away from their planet when the race was massacred. Her parents were dead now, though. She was kidnapped by the Collector and had implants forcefully inserted in her to make her stronger, traumatizing her. She escaped and sold the Groots to raise money for the extraction surgery, not realizing they were intelligent creatures. She meant no harm. Then it dawned on the team: The Collector was creating a Guardians tribute band with duplicates of each member — a Zen-Whoberian for Gamora, a Groot duplicate, earth raccoons to create another Rocket. Kiya wanted to amend the harm she'd done to Groot, and the Guardians agreed to protect her, so they started collecting all the duplicates.\nTensions ran high. Groot was weaker each day, and Rocket didn't trust Kiya. He didn't have many friends outside their ship, and in their small group, the one person he was closest to in the whole galaxy was pretty much unkillable. When it turned out that friend might be more killable than anyone thought, he was taking it hard. Furthermore, Kiya couldn't manage to figure out how to make the Groots fuse back. Killing them didn't do the trick. They managed to half-fuse if their personalities were similar, but each one had different memories, different personalities.\nThe most dangerous Grootling the Guardians must find was one that was raised to grow poisonous spores. They visited DiMave to find the buyer, and they talked to the person who acted as the middleman, bartender Annay. They learned that the DiMavi were attacked by Kree raiders years ago, and the Kree never prosecuted, causing a strong resentment between the races. Furthermore, a peace ceremony would be held between the Kree and the DiMavi in planet Vadin. So the buyer — Baran — would use his Groot as a weapon to kill Kree and trigger a war. The Guardians, Kiya and Annay headed there, where they found another Groot buyer: Ka-Lenn. He worked with the government and opened many doors for the Guardians because he was the one who installed the implants in Kiya, and he didn't want anyone to know. Inevitably, a panic broke out in the conference as the poisonous Groot ran amok. When he was about to shoot his spores at an innocent crowd, all the Grootlings jumped from the Guardians' ship to protect the people. This act of heroism overrode all their individual differences, and they fused as they fell. The fall would have killed the weakened Grootlings, but they landed as a single powerful Groot. They protected the crowd, and absorbed the poisonous Grootling. In the end, it turned out Baran was another victim, and the real mastermind of the terrorism had been Annay all along. With that out of the way, they still had the problem of the Collector. But they had a plan. Rocket called him and gave Kiya away in exchange for the four Grootlings in the Collector's possession. Then, the Guardians blackmailed Ka-Lenn: he must convince the Kree, his people, to rescue Kiya and retrieve her experimental Kree implants, or else the Guardians would say Ka-Lenn was responsible. Kiya was rescued and granted protection, and the Collector never learned the Guardians betrayed him. Groot was whole once again, and Gamora met another one of her species she could keep up with. The group asked Rocket if he really would have sold out Kiya for the Groots, and he had to think about it, but he said no. In a way, Kiya was Gamora's family, making it his family.[250]\nAround this time, Rocket attended a pool party withJeff the Land Shark,Shayla Smith,Wasp,Moon Girl,Power Pack,Captain Marvel,Captain America,Hulk,Miles Morales,Ghost-Spider,Black Panther,Doctor Strange,Nightcrawler,Devil Dinosaur,Jean Grey,Iceman,Jessica Jones,Luke Cage,Viv Vision,Ironheart,Misty Knight,Iron Fist,Winter Soldier,Mockingbird,Star-Lord,Gamora,Squirrel Girl,Ms. Marvel,Namor,Tippy-Toe,Howard The Duck,Billy Kaplan,Teddy Altman,Wasp (Janet Van Dyne),Ant-Man,Thor (Jane Foster),Storm,Drax,Groot,Ghost RiderandDaimon Hellstrom.[251]\nLater, the Guardians wanted to recover Angela from a Badoon prison planet, so they split the team into smaller units. Rocket worked with The Thing; he allowed himself to be captured by the Badoon so that Thing could strike at the right moment. While Thing dealt with the fighting, Rocket rounded up the slaves so they could leave the planet. As they were leaving, Rocket caught a galaxy-wide message: Star-Lord was captured and about to be executed in the Badoon capital,Moord.[252]The Guardians traveled to Moord, where they rescued Peter and took over the planet with the help of the thousands of slaves they rescued. It was one of their greatest victories. As they were leaving, they received a transmission: Captain Marvel wanted their support in the ongoing superheroCivil Waron Earth.[253]\nThe Guardians voted on whether they should go to Earth to help Captain Marvel, and Rocket voted no, because he hated Earth. Still, they decided to go. They visited Earth and the Captain introduced the Guardians to her team, Alpha Flight. The Captain explained the civil war taking place: they had found an inhuman capable of seeing the future,Ulysses Cain (Earth-616), and they were using him to prevent crimes. This had divided the superhuman community because of those who considered it anti-ethical. Carol was in favor of the inhuman, and so she wanted to stop Iron Man's side.[254]\nCaptain Marvel assembled her side; Ulysses had predicted an alien invasion and they must stop it. At the start of the invasion a truck of baby powder would be stolen from a factory in rural Georgia, so Rocket and Groot called dibs on preventing that. Rocket had a self-serving reason: only one person could need that much baby powder and he had a huge bounty on his head:Chammy, a low-level loser smuggler who powered his ship with baby powder. He was one of the first bounties Rocket had tried to collect, but after catching him he'd escaped jail. They flew to the factory and spotted Chammy, but suddenly the fourth-wall breaking heroineGwenpoolearrived and kidnapped him. Rocket and Groot fought her for Chammy, but when they turned around he was gone. It was a small neighborhood, so they asked around and found out where Chammy lived.[34]Rocket and Groot agreed to a peace treaty with Gwenpool, and broke into Chammy's house. There they found Chammy had left, but they tracked him to some swamps. Chammy was captured byReeve, the alien that put a bounty on Chammy to start with. He was evil and had secret plans, so instead of paying Rocket he beat everyone up and left. Chammy then asked for help.[255]Chammy explained his past: his planet was saved by Captain Marvel and he used to be a smuggler working for Reeve, but Reeve was murderous and wanted to obtain a formula to take away Captain Marvel's powers. To protect her, Chammy hid the formula, but now Reeve had it. The cast rushed over to Alpha Flight to save Captain Marvel from being assassinated, and arrived right in the middle of it. Reeve knocked everybody out, except for Chammy, who saved the day. Everyone went their own ways.[256]\nLater, the Guardians got on their mission of being Captain Marvel's cavalry, and waited behind theTriskelionfor Iron Man's side to attack. While they were waiting, Rocket ranted about why he hated Earth: humans had all the technology to bring them to the next level and they did nothing with it; they drove cars that they knew were polluting the air they breathed; their communication was still mostly text-based; they killed each other over their skin color; their process to select leaders was so painful it drove away the skilled people and left only the power hungry who'd put up with the torture chamber. It seemed humans couldn't learn from their mistakes. Star-Lord, however, thought Rocket was just resentful of the fact that he looked just like an Earth raccoon.\nSuddenly, Captain Marvel gave them the signal that it was go-time. Rocket saw the army of heroes they had to fight and thought: “That's it?” And so began an intense fifty-minute fight. Rocket began to enjoy his visit to Earth as he shot off unsuspecting idiots, but Spider-Man (Miles Morales)knocked him down.[257]During the fight, a stray beam fromVisiondestroyed the Guardian's ship – irreversibly. The fight was called out shortly after. Rocket was depressed after losing his home, everything he owned. He was losing his mind because Earth was not fit for space travel yet – they were grounded, trapped on that place he hated. Drax tried to tell him the important thing was they had each other, but Rocket didn't listen.[258]Things got worse when the team found out Star-Lord knew Thanos was being held on Earth and chose not to tell Gamora. Instead of discussing it with any of his trusted teammates, Star-Lord went to his ex-girlfriend Kitty. Hurt and betrayed, the team disbanded.[259]\nAfter saying good-bye to Groot in Central Park,[260]Rocket wandered off alone toTimes Square. He entered a strip club, but he got kicked out. When a homeless man asked him for money, Rocket entered a fast food shop and stole some food for him; he didn't understand Earth customs. The police went after him, and he started fighting them in a subway train. Ultimately, TheHuman Torchcame pick him up and rescued him. He took him to his home in Attilan of the Inhumans, where he lived among the royalty. He told Rocket Earth could use a guy like him, but Rocket didn't like the planet and thought the planet didn't like him. He met another animal superhero:Lockjawof the Inhumans, only he couldn't talk. Unimpressed, Rocket waited until the Torch was asleep and he used his computer to find a certain shi'ar, Ra'chaun. Finding him in a bar, the two old friends caught up and Ra'chaun admitted he might know a guy who could get Rocket off Earth. Later, Rocket met Mr. Soft Teeth, a skrull. However, Soft Teeth was suddenly murdered by a human.[90]Rocket quickly shot him dead, and left without any answers. He carjacked a cab and traveled back to Ra'chaun's bar. The shi'ar was not there, but Rocket heard from an alien named Jack Beagle that a group of humans was hunting all aliens for sport. They couldn't work, they couldn't get in the system, so somebody figured they could just die without anybody noticing. Abruptly, all the aliens in the bar picked a fight with Rocket because he drew too much attention by being there; he put them all in danger. The fight was called off by Miles Morales, who showed up.\nRocket meets Lockjaw\nRocket tried to leave and find Beagle again, but Miles didn't want him to walk away with a gun. Rocket got angry and started punching him, basically getting payback from the way he was knocked out by him during the Second Civil War. Wanting to make up, Miles found Beagle's backpack for Rocket. In there, Rocket found napkins from Tyler's Tacos, so that became his destination. He started searching across the city, but he was suddenly captured by Kraven the Hunter: the man who trained all the alien hunters.[261]The two of them fought, but Rocket was knocked out when Kraven ran him over with his van. Rocket woke up in the van, along with all the other aliens from the bar. He managed to escape and crash the van, letting everyone escape. Kraven and him fought again, and the police got involved, so Rocket escaped. Kraven spent the rest of the day tracking Rocket's smell, but it turned out Rocket had swapped clothes with a real raccoon to fool Kraven and run him over with a garbage truck. Kraven survived, so Rocket ran in his underwear and jumped into the Staten Island Ferry. After a short nap, the ferry crashed against a big ship that was hijacked by Kraven.[262]Rocket fell from the ferry onto the Statue of Liberty, where Kraven took the fight. Rocket used a flare gun to combust the hijacked ship, causing a massive explosion that destroyed the Statue. Inevitably, S.H.I.E.L.D. arrived at the scene and they knocked out Rocket. When he woke up, he'd been taken to Camp Oubliette, a camp for alien refugees, where he met all the aliens from the bar. He quickly put together a plan: assembling certain parts from the camp, he built a flamethrower.[8]He helped everybody escape, but he stayed behind to fight with the guards. Things looked grim when his flamethrower malfunctioned, but Kraven suddenly showed up and rescued Rocket. Turned out he considered Rocket too great of a fighter to die. Rocket met up with his bar buddies. One of them, Sycorax, was an inhuman who could use her powers to get everybody off Earth; all that was left to do was pick up her teleporter from Ra'chaun's place. When Rocket peeked inside, however, he saw Kraven and Ra'chaun were in cahoots. Angered, Rocket waited until Kraven left, then set Ra'chaun's house on fire. Having picked up the teleporter, Rocket met the other aliens in Central Park. Sycorax opened a portal to another planet, but as everybody was leaving Kraven arrived to break more havoc. Regrettably, Rocket must stay behind to hold Kraven off. The portal was closed, but Rocket defeated Kraven. The Human Torch and the Inhumans arrived to pick up the bad guy, and Rocket denied he had just acted like a hero.[263]\nThe Guardians assembled for an uncomfortable reunion when giant monsters started falling from the sky all over the world, necessitating a global response from every superhero. The Guardians protected Seattle, where Rocket saw the Space Needle for the first time and thought if the humans wanted to reach the stars, they needed to start thinking on a bigger scale.[264]The Guardians got in contact with the Avengers, who were coordinating the efforts, and they sentThorto help the Guardians. Thor helped them take the monsters down, but more kept on coming; the heroes were overrun. They called for reinforcements, assembling most American heroes in Seattle.[265]When the band of monster met, however, they started fighting each other: it seemed there were good monsters and bad monsters. The good monsters won, then vanished. The heroes were directed toKei Kawade, a kid who might be the cause for all the monsters: he summoned them when he drew them. Groot and Rocket interrogated him, and Kei was capable of understanding Groot's language because he saw him on TV and started drawing him. To demonstrate his powers, Kei drewDevil Dinosaur, who was summoned into the room. Rocket took a photo of the T-Rex.[266]While the heroes figured out how to stop the monsters with Kei's help, the Guardians kept stopping the oncoming waves. They could barely keep themselves from arguing with each other long enough to fight, but all hell broke loose when aFurnaxshowed up. The Furnax were natural predators in Groot's homeworld; they set fire to trees. Upon seeing him, Groot froze and was swallowed up. Rocket flew off to rescue him on his own, upset that the other Guardians didn't even know Groot well enough to identify the Furnax. Rocket knew that as Groot was being burned alive, his body kept on regenerating, so he could be suffering for days. Rocket made his way inside the monster and found Groot, who had given up against his natural predator. Rocket scoffed at that – he was so small, everything was his natural predator. The duo escaped, and the other Guardians arrived to help, having put their differences aside. After the beast was destroyed, however, the crisis continued, and the Guardians still couldn't call themselves a team.[267]Kei Kawade solved the crisis shortly after.[268]\nRocket meets Devil Dinosaur\nAround this time, Rocket and the Guardians attended the funeral of Jack Flag, an ex Guardian.[269]What they didn't know was he had killed by Captain America, who had been brainwashed by the terrorist organization Hydra and kept pretending he was a hero. The moment he revealed his true allegiance would come very soon.\nRocket and Groot met up with Angela to watch the US elections at the only bar who would serve Angela's friends.[270]Later, Star-Lord found Rocket alone in the bar, trying half the cocktails and hating all of them. Peter's time on Earth hadn't been good, so he apologized for messing up the team and begged Rocket for forgiveness. Rocket, however, needed more time and left.[271]\nLater, Rocket and Peter met up with Captain Marvel to discuss possible ways to get off-planet. The Captain realized there was a spaceship graveyard in Indonesia, where they could cobble something together. Before they could do anything, though, a full-scale alien invasion appeared: it was Thanos. Rocket decided to head to the Spaceship Graveyard instead of tackling the villain; he had a plan. As the other Guardians beat Thanos up, Rocket arrived with a fleet he hastily put together, which served as deterrent to make the alien invaders scatter. Now Thanos was on his own, defeated. They delivered him to the Nova Corps, and the Guardians made up. Rocket built a cheap ship for them, and they left Earth; things were back to normal.[272]\nShortly after the team reformed, they received a call from the Collector saying his collection was going to go near Pluto and that they should go check it out, in case they could find something to help them guard the galaxy. It was an obvious trap, but the Guardians fell for it and were trapped, the latest additions to the Collector's collection. It was their sixth run-in with the Elder. The Collector claimed a coming darkness threatened the galaxy, so he wished to save as many people as possible within his collection. Shortly after he left, Rocket managed to build something to short circuit his cell and escape. He snuck into the Artificial Gravity Generator and loaded it into his device, then let himself be caught again. When he tried to reverse the gravity, though, he simply broke it, creating mayhem. The Collector fell on the wrong lever and accidentally opened all the cells, unleashing a horde of monsters upon the Guardians. Suddenly, gravity was fixed back again, allowing the Guardians to escape. They made it outside, but they still had no way of calling for their ship, so Rocket just started calling out for anyone. Luckily, Mantis responded, and she arrived just in time to rescue her ex-teammates. As they left, they heard on the radio that the freed prisoners had taken control of the facility; everything turned out fine.[273]\nDue to their fame, reporter Tana'ri Dan'ae of the Intergalactic Network decided to interview Rocket and Groot. Thinking Rocket was Groot's sidekick, she asked Groot why he did what he did. Groot, speaking in his language, said it was to bring honor between species, for the kids, and to be role models, all of which angered Rocket, who stormed off.[274]\nRocket's lowest point\nAround this time, Gamora realized a piece of her soul was stuck in the Soul Gem. Looking for information, she agreed to steal a baby universe from the city of Citopia forthe Grandmaster, one of the Elders of the Universe. The Guardians agreed to stay together for this last heist, a heist so big that they could go their separate ways after it and live comfortably. Rocket and Groot visited theStohlad Ring, looking for information in its black market. They metMessihi, who gave them the layout of the vault of Citopia. Suddenly, an Elder of the Universe teleported in:The Gardener, who had been poisoned and driven mad by Loki. He killed Messihi and knocked out Rocket. When he woke up, Groot had taken him back to their ship, and he sent him flying away. Groot stayed behind, and Rocket watched as the Gardener killed him. Rocket was heartbroken; he considered it the worst, lowest moment of his life. But he realized Groot had snuck in one of his splinters with him; he could regrow. Rocket quickly rushed to the Guardians' base and planted Groot. However, he didn't grow back to normal; he couldn't grow higher than a foot. Groot was not the same as always, and Rocket swore he'd get revenge on the Gardener. All of this was being watched by Mojo of Mojoworld.[275]The new baby Groot proved hard to control, as he quickly filled the Guardians' headquarters with scribbles over the walls, ceilings and floors. While Rocket was scolding him about it, Groot suddenly teleported away from the scene.[276]When Groot came back, he hugged Rocket in tears of relief after the long journey he'd undertaken to get home, but Rocket simply started barking orders at Groot to clean all of his scribbles up. When acting cute didn't help change Rocket's mind, Groot used his roots to make Rocket lay down and discover a painting Groot had done of the two of them. This relieved the raccoon, until he discovered another painting next to it of himself looking like an angry grump. Finally, Groot was forced to clean it all up.[277]\nLater, the entire team was captured by the Nova Corps. They quickly escaped, but on their way to their ship Rocket found theMilano: a better, more beautiful ship. He instantly fell in love and the crew agreed on stealing it. What they didn't know was the ship was from the Shi'ar Empire'sFraternity of Raptors, and they were going to want it back.[278]\nBefore the heist, several adventures took place; first, Rocket and the Guardians were camped on Moona Station when they were attacked by a group of bounty hunters sent by Star-Lord's half-sisterCaptain Victoria. In an effort to keep his friends safe, Star-Lord stole a ship to draw the bounty hunters away from them. By the time they found him, Star-Lord's body had shut down from injuries, and he would be dead except for his brain, that showed some crazy activity. Rocket acted as doctor and took care of Peter; turned out after a lifetime of learning how to take people apart, he wasn't so bad at putting them together again. After some work, Rocket managed to make Peter wake up. He acted strangely; while he was out he'd experienced a vision of the afterlife, but he only told Gamora about it.[279]\nA space mailman was passing around Earth with a package for the Collector when he was attacked byYondu'sRavagers. They stole his package, assuming it must be some great weapon. But the trucker managed to send out a distress signal, so the Guardians arrived and shoot the Ravagers down to Earth. While the others entertained Yondu and his men, Rocket fiddled with the package, opening its lock. Then he laughed: it was just an odor-fighting fabric. Realizing he couldn't make any money off that, Yondu left. Rocket sold the tech to some research guys that were hanging around in the park, looking to get rich. But Star-Lord explained to him human dollars didn't have value anywhere else in the universe; they were worthless. Frustrated, Rocket threw all his money around the park as they left.[280]\nBack on Earth, the evil Captain America kept causing problems. Due to some Chitauri eggs he'd hidden, he kept attracting Chitauri hordes to Earth. Earth's heroes managed to destroy them, but the waves kept on getting bigger until a massive horde arrived. The Guardians arrived to help Alpha Flight and the Ultimates defend the planet.[281]Things seemed bleak when their biggest heavy hitter,Quasar, was beaten into a coma,[282]but Captain America managed to activate thePlanetary Defense Shield: a force-field covering the entire planet and preventing anyone from entering. The Chitauri threw themselves at the shield, killing themselves. However, at the same time Captain America revealed his Hydra allegiance and took over America. He kept the shield up, trapping all the superheroes in space, forced to face the endless waves of Chitauri.[283]As ammo, food and water ran low, Captain Marvel convinced the Guardians to go recruit help across the Galaxy.[284]\nThe Guardians split to visit separate planets; Rocket and Groot were sent toNew Halfworld, a mysterious planet of which little is known. However, every planet they visited refused to help Earth. As Star-Lord lost himself in drinks, Rocket wanted him to forget about Earth already – he refused to admit they had lived in it for a while, calling it a pit stop at best. Right as the Guardians agreed to tell Star-Lord they were going to drop the mission, he received a message from Mantis. This ex-Guardian informed them of a place in theJojola Nebulawhere worshippers of Galactus stored a super weapon that could destroy the Planetary Shield. Problem was, the Jojola Nebula was like theBermuda Triangleof space — no one had made it out of there alive. Only one man had; Star-Lord's old mentor, Yondu. Star-Lord hated the treacherous pirate, but he agreed to work with him for the sake of Earth. They managed their way into the Nebula, where Rocket accessed a computer that told them the weapon they were looking for was theTransluminal Tuning Fork. Problem was, the planet was overrun withPunishers, Galactus' foot soldiers who defended his stuff. To make things worse, Yondu betrayed the team and called his own team, the Ravagers. He wanted the Tuning Fork to sell it to Earth and become rich. The Ravagers boarded the Milano into their ship, but they all had to retreat to the planet when they were overrun by Punishers. Suddenly, Gamora arrived with the Tuning Fork, defeating all the hostiles. As the Guardians left, the Fork fell apart; using it once burned it out. It was never enough to destroy the Shield. Star-Lord considered abandoning Earth, but Gamora was moved by Peter's efforts and convinced him to stay in the fight. Mantis had foreseen the Tuning Fork would help the Guardians find something to help them take the Shield down; and they found each other.[285]Later, the Guardians tried to make a plea to the rulers of the cosmic empires: the Kree, Brood, Skrull, Shi'ar and Spartax. However, all these empires wanted Earth destroyed so the Guardians had to run for their lives.[286]\nRocket faces Supreme Hydra\nThe Guardians returned empty-handed, but just in time to join an Alpha Flight plan to use their fleet as a net to destroy the Chitauri waves. After they thought the Chitauri destroyed, Alpha Flight used all of its energy to try to puncture the Planetary Shield, but they failed and lost power. Right then, another Chitauri wave approached.[287]In a desperate gamble, the Ultimates sent superheroineAmericato find Galactus to ask him for help. While everybody waited for her, Rocket got anxious; he hated waiting. He wouldn't go anywhere because he felt as if he owed Captain Marvel one, but he thought getting locked out of your own planet was a very “Earth” thing to do.[288]Sadly, Galactus chose to stay on the sidelines for that conflict. Even worse, he teleported the Ultimates away, needing them for anEternity War. Rocket couldn't believe their heavy hitters were kidnapped.[289]Weeks went by of hopeless battle. Some Earthers discussed setting a colony off-world, but others were outraged at the idea of abandoning Earth. Rocket laughed; that bunch made his team look functional. When Captain Marvel began accepting any crazy idea someone might come up with, Rocket mentioned he stole a Nullifier Bomb that they could deliver if they sacrificed the Alpha Flight base. They threw the base at the Shield, but it didn't even put a dent on it. When all seemed lost, Quasar woke up from her coma. She used all her strength to finally destroy the Planetary Shield, killing herself in the process.[290]The Guardians were able to join the fight against Hydra on Earth.[291]Earth's heroes launched a final, desperate attack against Captain America on Washington.[292]They all rushed the Captain, but they didn't stand a chance against his Cosmic Cube. Eventually, the real Captain America came back and defeated his evil doppelganger.[293]\nAfter this crisis, Rocket visited a bar on Digriz; a bad bar on a bad world in a bad sector. But nobody asked questions, and after Earth Rocket needed a little time for himself. Getting drunk, Rocket started rambling about his safes-cracking days when he suddenly spotted Otta Spice; his ex-girlfriend, ex-partner in crime. He still remembered how she framed him and put him in jail, so he didn't want anything to do with her, but she explained she needed help for a bigger cause. After they had parted ways she had returned to her homeplanet, Tarka's World, a planet full of natural resources that people wanted to exploit. Recently, an outfit called Beavertron Incorporated had gained power and wanted to build a dam that would devastate the rivers for hundreds of miles. Otta needed Rocket because she needed to acquire the deeds to the land to do anything, but they were stored in a Sekurimax vault — impossible to crack. Rocket played it hard to get, but ultimately accepted. He knew he couldn't do it alone, so he hired theTechnet, a group of mercs. The same vault held over a ton of uncut Lux-crystal, so there was plenty of payment. Problem was, the Technet had split up a month ago over a lack of funding, so there was half of them to go around. This was fine for Rocket, so they started to work. There was only one entrance to the vault, uncrackable; it was guarded by an A.I. bouncer connected to the population database. However, a powerful database had to have equivalent power needs, including coolant. The team hypothesized the cheapest coolant available was water, so Otta got into the lake nearby and sabotaged the inflow point with foam, blocking the way. The A.I. overheated and shut down. Making their way in, the next obstacle was a room full of assassins. They didn't put much of a fight; when your only job was to sit and wait you got rusty. So they reached the vault, and opened it using one of the Technet's explosive powers. However, inside the vault they found the other half of the Technet's members; they had been hired as security.[40]\nThe two Technet teams began fighting, and Rocket got into the vault in the confusion. To find the right item, Rocket used “the eyeball”, a keepsake from his Halfworld days, when he was a warden for crazy humanoids. If they got lost, the eyeball was designed to find them via gene signature, so Rocket programmed it to find a Tarkan river-rush. Rocket got the deeds, but outside the vault all the Technet members had agreed to turn Rocket in, so he was on his own. He spotted Otta on the other side of the room, folded the deeds into a paper plane and threw it at her. Otta grabbed it and ran off in her own, but Rocket felt it was all worth it just to see her smile. Rocket was captured and taken to trial. His lawyer was useless, but he saw the jury was made of Tarkans like Otta. Rocket felt they'd understand he was a good guy, so he decided to defend himself. He claimed he was guilty, but he was just trying to take from scum to give to a better kind of people. Problem was, Otta was working for the Beavertron Corporation all along; they had been stealing from the people. Rocket was taken to prison.[294]\nRocket was taken to the SecuriMax Ultrapen 8000, the safest prison of them all. A floating sphere in space, there was nowhere to even escape to. Rocket had been in private prisons before, and he knew they were about punishment rather than rehabilitation. So he kept his head down and followed the rules: two sentients per cell, complete your work shift, and stay out of “The Hole”, the punishment room with no gravity and white walls that seemed to go on forever. When Rocket heard he'd gotten a visitor, he got his hopes up, but it was justGatecrasher, the Technet's leader. As Rocket was thinking how sexy she was, she revealed they wanted to break him out of there. The Technet got a permanent contract with Securimax, so if Rocket escaped they got the same bounty for re-capturing him, over and over and over. Rocket could get a life sentence, or worse. He had to make his move that day. First he picked a fight with QGAXBQ-4, his roommate, a gaseous being contained in a humanoid suit. Rocket ripped his suit open, secretly hiding an electro-stylus inside him. They were both sent to the Hole, and it was everything people said. Nothing but white space and a sound only Rocket's ears could hear, the whir of a hidden camera. Pretending he'd been driven crazy, Rocket attacked an octopus alien trapped with him and made him squirt ink at the camera. Now that they couldn't be seen, Rocket retrieved his electro-stylus and short-circuited everybody's shock collars. They were adapted to cause pain to each particular alien, so Rocket grabbed one filled with molecular acid and used it to open a hole in the wall and escape. The EMP charge in a robot's collar took out the security cameras, and Rocket reached the airlock easily. They didn't have a lot of security; there was nothing on the other side. Nothing but the death of space, unless you had an airtight suit. Rocket floated to the guard station in orbit to the prison, where guards jumped in to receive him. He knocked them out with his shock implant, and made it to the other side. The guard station had barely any security, so six hours later he was back where he started, the bar in Digriz, but now he was a fugitive with a price on his head. To do something about that he'd need help - and that was when he saw Deadpool.[295]\nThe merc with a mouth was hanging out in space to escape from recent sins he'd committed in Earth; he wanted to feel like he belonged somewhere again. So to help Rocket he suggested he paid the Technet off, so that they stopped chasing him. Rocket and Deadpool needed money and Rocket knew they couldn't rob anyone legitimate; that meant mob money. They had to go for Cordyceps Jones. However, he kept all his money in an account only he could open using his actual brain-waves. Still, they snuck into a high-society party Jones was attending and Deadpool jumped from a cake and started shooting at him. Then the truth about Jones was revealed; he wasn't a humanoid, but a spore, a fungus that took over bodies. After his body was shot down, he took over Deadpool. But Deadpool had a healing factor, so he maintained enough will power to escape with Rocket and head to a bank. The brainwave scan checked; Jones was inside Deadpool's head. They were able to get the money. Then Deadpool got Jones out of his system by vomiting, even though Jones promised revenge. As they got ready to part ways, Rocket tried reaching out to Deadpool and talk about his problems, but Deadpool just left. So now Rocket shouldn't have any more problems, but he took it to the next level: Instead of just getting the Technet off his back, he hired them to take revenge on Otta.[296]\nRocket could have left it all behind, but people were going to lose their homes to the Beavertron Corporation because he'd stolen the deeds to the land. It was time for a heist. The target was Beavetron HQ, in orbit above Digriz, hidden in a dimensional pocket. They could get in through Max Sekuri — head of Sekurimax. After Rocket had escaped the prison, Sekurimax's stock was declining, so Max was going to sell his firm to Beavertron. First they cornered Max in a bathroom and used one of the Technet:Joyboy's power was that he could make wishes come true. So Rocket and Max swapped bodies, and Max was sent to Rocket's prison, where he couldn't talk. With Rocket in Max's body, they were able to make it past the gene-scan, but then there was a telepath. Luckily, one of the Technet used his powers to shrink the whole team inside Rocket's case — except forScatterbrain, which Rocket kept hidden in his hand. When the telepath touched Rocket, Scatterbrain confused his brain and he let them go. Later, Rocket met Gnawbarque, head of Beavertron. Otta was with him, and Rocket stared at her a second too long. Otta recognized him, and Rocket tried to tell her he still loved her, but she pulled out a gun and shot him dead.[297]\nIn a death-like trance, Rocket remembered his past life in Halfworld, and even Lylla, his old lover. But Joyboy's wishes didn't last forever. The wish wore off, and Rocket turned back to his original body, unharmed. He covered from Otta's shooting, and she knocked out Gnawbarque. Rocket tried to appeal to her morality, but she explained her people always held her down, so they deserved what was coming to them. Rocket opened his case and unleashed the Technet; Gatecrasher knocked Otta out. Rocket realized he'd never met anyone like Gatecrasher, and he probably never would again. He only realized that when it was already too late. Gatecrasher heard Rocket tell Otta he still loved her; she didn't want anything to do with him anymore. Afterward, Rocket took Otta's gun with him and put the deeds on the mail. Everything was solved, and he was back to the bar where everything had started. He waited in the empty bar until Star-Lord came for him. A week had passed; Groot missed him. Rocket went with Star-Lord, leaving his possessions in the table: the gun that killed him and a holotape of somebody else. Of Ranger Rocket, a happier person from times long gone.[298]\nAfter a diseased alien landed on Earth, Wolverine (Laura Kinney) was able to use her healing powers to create a cure for the illness. Tracing where the alien came from, Earth decided to call the Guardians of the Galaxy to ask for help in delivering the cure light years away. Wolverine also brought her protégéGabbyand their pet wolverine, Jonathan. A week later, they reached their destination: a moon that wasn't sending any communications. As they approached the lunar base, they started being chased by Brood; the heroes rushed into the base, but young Gabby got lost.[299]Once they were in the base, the scientists explained that place was a cutting edge disease center. But the Brood arrived and destroyed their communications, forcing them to stay holed up. The Brood also took the animals from the center and turned them into more of their own. When Rocket heard they were experimenting diseases on animals, he lost it, but Star-Lord convinced him not to shoot anyone. The scientists explained the virus that hit Earth was the result of an attempt to reverse the Brood infection, but it simply filled the organism with rage. Wolverine, Gamora and Star-Lord headed into the Brood hive to rescue Gabby, while Rocket and the rest headed to the Milano to send out a message asking for help.[300]While they did so, Rocket found Jonathan the wolverine badly hurt, and started doing everything he could to heal him. He received a call from Star-Lord announcing the situation had changed: they had found Gabby turned into a Brood, and with her healing properties she could create an unkillable army. They needed to evacuate and blow up the moon. Rocket built a bomb, and everybody started leaving, but Wolverine couldn't get herself to leave Gabby behind. She stayed on the moon, trying to reach Gabby. When everything seemed hopeless, Gabby's healing factor purged the entire Brood queen, releasing her. Wolverine grabbed Gabby, and they flew with a jetpack to the Milano. As they arrived, Rocket revealed he stuck a universal translator on Jonathan, allowing the wolverine to communicate with her masters. However, not everything was tied up. The Brood only traveled by an Acanti or a Star Shark, but there were no signs of either of those huge creatures. The heroes realized the Broods were being experimented on, and that was how they got loose. Both Rocket and Wolverine said they knew a thing or two about experiments that got away. The scientist got beaten up, but he begged for them not to destroy the moon – all of his research would be lost, ways to weaponize the Brood. However, Gabby blew it up anyway. As the heroes discussed how to deal with the scientist, Rocket got tired of the moral conundrum and simply threw him out of the air lock, to the vacuum of space.[301]\nLater, Rocket heard Deadpool had acquired the Ultimate Nulifier and bounty hunters of all corners of space were going after him. Rocket geared up and followed Deadpool's trail into Knowhere. However, when he found the chaos, mayhem and piles of corpses Deadpool was creating, he decided he'd just take a pass on that one.[302]\nRocket and Star-Lord were present when Captain Marvel returned from a trip toEarth-25271, where she'd met a version of Rocket namedRockettewho was a human woman. Carol hugged Peter tightly upon arriving, after which Rocket began teasing Peter about it.[303]\nEventually, Groot being stuck in his baby form became a liability. He was more excited and playful, almost like he'd regressed mentally to childhood; to escape boredom he took control of the ship's wheel, or scared the other Guardians. Rocket decided to give him a stern talk, but Rocket was no parent. He picked the wrong words and made Groot feel like an annoyance. When everybody was called to the front of the ship to see a space-time distortion, Groot jumped into the control panel and steered the ship towards it. The team went through the portal and accidentally found themselves in another dimension. The quickly turned around and got back, but Groot activated an escape pod and got stuck in the other dimension. When he realized this, Rocket freaked out, wanting to rescue his buddy. But the portal had closed; they had no way of going back.[304]As it turned out, the place in which Groot landed wasPlanet Terminal, a hub across dimensions; but they had shut the door when the demonShuma-Gorathhad tried to enter our reality. Groot punched the demon in the face, and the inhabitants of Terminal helped Groot get back. When he was reunited with the Guardians, only a minute had passed for them, so they didn't believe Groot had been gone for three days.[305]\nLater, Drax was summoned by Squirrel Girl and Loki to fight against the Silver Surfer. The fight seemed to be going badly, so Loki summoned Rocket and Groot to defend Squirrel Girl's friend,Nancy. Rocket had no idea what was going on, but he felt magically compelled to defend Nancy. Loki also summoned Cosmo,Beta Ray Bill, Ego the Living Planet and others. However, the Surfer slapped them so hard they each went back to the planets from which they came.[306]\nFinally, the team executed their heist in Citopia. With their Galactus mecha completed, they showed up in the planet and made everybody flee to evacuate, leaving their vaults unguarded. Rocket flew their mecha to the vault, Drax opened it and they left with the package. They abandoned the Galactus behind and headed to meet the Grandmaster with the Milano. The Elder of the Universe revealed the item they had stolen was a tachyon bubble holding a baby universe; a perfect addition to his collection. But it was just a test; now it was time for the Guardian's real challenge. He wanted them to enter the Collector's collection and steal the Hujahdarian Monarch Egg. At first the team argued that stealing from an Elder was suicide, but the Grandmaster revealed the universe they stole had originally been sold to the Collector, and if they didn't accept his mission, he would tell his brother who stole it. The Guardians had been double-crossed, and it looked like they were sticking together for another job.[307]The Collector's base was heavily guarded, but they entered by hiding themselves in a monster's bowels and being pushed out with its excrement. After fighting some guards they were attacked by ghosts that made them see their worst fears: unlike last time Rocket faced his worst fears, with Mother Entropy, and saw himself not being the last one of his kind, this time Rocket felt himself being pulled apart and reassembled for nothing more than a laugh. Luckily, Drax managed to scare them away. When it seemed they had a clear coast to escape with the egg, they were apprehended by the Collector; it was their seventh encounter.[308]Rocket tried shooting him dead, but he just regenerated. The Guardians tried escaping, and Gamora had a private conversation with the Collector. After she claimed to have an Infinity Stone, he agreed to let them go with the egg they were looking for. Gamora was to find out if the Grandmaster had acquired a Stone; if he had the one Gamora was looking for, she would give the Stone she had to the Collector. On their way back, tensions among the Guardians ran high; there were many unsaid secrets. Things were so tense that Groot snapped and attacked Rocket, which caused him to retreat to his room, depressed.[309]\nAfterwards, the team had a meeting and they forced Gamora to spill the beans. She explained she was looking for the Soul Gem because she was trapped inside it for a while, and a piece of her soul was stuck within. Suddenly, the Milano was shut down by the Raptors, looking to take back the Milano. At least that was what the Guardians thought: in fact, the Raptors wanted a corpse hidden in the ship, containing the Nega-Bands. When Rocket saw they were taking it, he stole Gamora's sword and stabbedTalon-R, the boss. However, he stabbed Rocket with his fangs, poisoning him. Wounded, Rocket managed to get back with one Nega-Band. As Rocket faltered, the team got a chance to test the Milano's med-bay. Rocket joked he'd always hoped he'd die screaming in bed — but not like this.[310]Looking to identify the poison, Star-Lord wore the Nega-Band they got and picked a fight with Talon-R, who wore the other Band. Meanwhile, even though Rocket was hurting, Gamora needed his help to locate the Milano's kill switch so they could get it moving again. He gave her instructions as best as he could, but she needed his eyes, so she carried Rocket on a backpack like he was baby. He only asked they didn't let Peter see him like that, but it was too late; Peter was back with the antidote. The only downside was he lost both Nega-bands. With Rocket cured, their next stop was meeting the Grandmaster.[311]\nWhen they met the Elder, they tried tricking him with a fake egg, but Gamora admited their ploy. The Grandmaster didn't mind — the egg exploded to reveal the Collector, who was hiding within to punch his brother for stealing from him. Regardless, the Grandmaster was happy. After the universe was remade during the Secret Wars, the Elders of the universe became lost, along with the Infinity Gems, which became the Infinity Stones. The Grandmaster wanted to find both of these — and it was in the Guardians' interest to help him, because he could smell The Gardener in Groot. Star-Lord revealed the Nova Corps had asked the Guardians for help, and that Thanos had escaped imprisonment right when the Infinity Stones were at large. So the galaxy was at risk, and Peter wanted to help. The Nova Corps might have information relevant to the Soul Stone. The group agreed unanimously to search for the Stones.[312]\nTheir first stop was Earth: Rocket tried askingBlack Panther, but the guy couldn't take a joke. They went to Doctor Doom,Doctor Strange, andCable, but the latter was in reality Loki, who was on his own search for the Stones. He was the one who drove the Gardener mad. When they went back to their ship, they found Deadpool as a stowaway — he wanted to leave Earth as a way to escape his sins. The Guardians didn't have none of it, and dropped him off. As they were leaving, however, Ant-Man showed up, having caught a ride on Rocket's back. He started explaining he had his own sad story for wanting to leave Earth, but Rocket didn't care. He could stick around; he was cool. As they were leaving, they realized they forgot Groot. They went back to Earth to find him with theMan-Thing, the protector of theNexus of All Realities. Man-Thing didn't have any leads on the Stones, but he knew the Guardians weren't the only ones looking: he showed them a vision of alternate reality versions of the Guardians who were looking as well. Apparently the stones had gone missing on every reality. The team was ready to leave, but they found the Nova-Corps in their ship: the Corps needed them.[313]\nRocket joins the Nova Corps\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy joined the Nova Corps non-officially. The team dressed up as Corpsmen in The Rock to try to weed out the spies who had infiltrated from the Brotherhood of the Raptors. Rocket took to the job like duck to water, sniffing out crooked corpsmen who were drinking impounded spirits from a crime scene.[314]Later he found a group looting a derelict vessel that had been found deserted.[315]For his efforts, he was promoted to denarian, and he knew at that rate he'd run the place soon.[316]Later, he made his move and tried to arrest all the corrupt Corpsmen, and a riot broke out. Rocket got everyone's attention with a gun and then ordered all the crooked Corpsmen to raise their hand — or be thrown out of the airlock. The bad guys complied and they were incarcerated. The job was not done - it was just a charade for Rocket's plan. As it turned out, most planets didn't want to send the new corps the best they had, at least until it proved itself. So the ones who hadn't been arrested were the problem; those who weren't hiding a little something were hiding everything. They were the spies and saboteurs; they weren't going to get caught shaking down a merchant or ripping the dead bones out of a dead guy. So Rocket and commander Adsit got back to the Brig right in time, as the actual crooked Corpsmen were trying to kill the prisoners. They released the prisoners and armed them — right as the Brotherhood of the Talon attacked The Rock.[317]The Guardians and the Novas began fighting the spies, as the Talons attacked. Rocket flew off and began shooting down their ships with the Nova-Force, but one of them had forcefields that were too strong. Ant-Man boarded the ship and turned giant inside it, destroying it. It was the funniest thing Rocket had seen in weeks, and to him that made bringing Ant-Man along worth it. The attack was called off, but the war wasn't over — the Talons found out the Nova Corps had found out the location of the Power Stone, and the news spread around the galaxy. The Guardians had other concerns, though – the Gardener had made himself known in planetTelferina. It seemed he was using the Groot fragments he stole as giant monsters. As they got ready to leave, Drax unexpectedly quit the team, wanting to stop seeing violence.[318]\nThe Guardians headed to Telferina, along with Nova (Richard).[319]Upon arriving, they began fighting an army of Groot doppelgangers. Rocket wasted no time, and flew towards the Gardener, stabbing him for what he did to his friend. But the old man was an elder of the universe, so he was unscathed. The rest of the team came along to help, but not even Nova's power could harm the Gardener. Everything changed when Groot jumped onto the old man, and used his roots to heal the Gardener from his poison, curing him of his madness. The Gardener in turn let Groot grow strong once more, back to the way he was, except now he could speak full sentences. Groot got ready to face the last evil splinter, a giant Groot namedScar.[320]Groot jumped inside Scar and destroyed him from the inside. The threat was finished, but the team had no time to rest, because Drax sent a distress signal from planetoidXitaung— where he'd retired to protect thePower Stone, and where the Talon and Chitauri forces had assembled. Rocket decided to arrive on his Galactus mech to cause an impression, but it fell apart upon arriving. On a sad turn of events, the leader of the Chitauri, Warbringer, destroyed the Milano, the Guardians' home. On top of things, the Power Stone was as big as a building, so it couldn't be transported.[321]During the fight, Ant-Man was knocked out and fell onto an outgoing transport, ultimately abandoning the team. As the battle seemed lost, the Nova Corps flew away, and Drax got ready to play his saxophone one last time. But Star-Lord touched the Stone and shrank it to a tiny rock, as it worked according to mind over matter. With the Stone, the Guardians defeated Warbringer and got off the planetoid. Just in time, too, as without the Stone it plunged into the nearest star and was destroyed.[322]\nSomewhere around this time, the Guardians stumbled upon a Wormhole Nexus that had been taken over by the Chitauri, who were using it to invade Earth through portals. After notifying Earth, Peter decided to attack the armada because the odds were so against them that the Chitauri would never expect it. As they charged, the Guardians received an astral projection ofDoctor Strange, whom Peter recognised. Strange explained to stop the onslaught they needed to simultaneously seal the portal connections between all their locations, so the Guardians shot down the main portal entry access points at the same time as Iron Man hacked the portals on Earth and Strange cut the Chitauri link to the nexus. The Chitauri were yanked back to their homeworld.[323]\nAfterwards, the Guardians arrived on Knowhere, where Nova left. Tensions rose when everybody argued about who should keep the Power Stone, Nova Corps included. In the end, though, Drax took it.[324]\nAfter Star-Lord received a visit froma Phyla-Vell from an alternate reality, he realized even alternate universes would be hounding them for the Gems. He was sick of hearing about the Gems, so the Guardians headed to Oblitus to get a safe house and lie low. They crossed the distance on a makeshift C.I.T.T., theCool Interstellar Travel Travelship, previously destroyed during the second Civil War. On the way they played a version of Monopoly, but Rocket didn't get the rules and kept trying to put three hotels on one property. However, their game was interrupted when the ship was shaken by the proximity of a Celestial on his way to Earth. They didn't recognize him, so Rocket made some calls and they found it wasGroffon the Regurger, a Celestial so dangerous few had lived after his passage, which was why he was unknown. Star-Lord broke down crying in fear and called the Avengers to warn them.[325]\nThe Guardians arrived in Oblitus. Groot complained he needed to plant his feet on dirt on a planet, or he'd start consuming meat and bone; Rocket didn't know when he was kidding anymore. They bumped into ex-Guardian Warlock, who was working together with Kang the Conqueror. Gamora freaked out when she realized Warlock possessed the Soul Stone she coveted, and tried to get it by force. When Drax touched it, however, he realized the Stone was corrupted, so he slapped Gamora away. Warlock and Kang left, and Drax decided to go with them. He was tired of guarding the galaxy. Gamora screamed that they had to go after them, but the rest of the team refused. Rocket thought it was too dangerous to seek the Stones, and there was no upside. Gamora left the team as well. Afterwards, Doctor Strange summoned the remaining Guardians for a gathering of theInfinity Watch— all the owners of an Infinity Stone. They'd gather in New York's Central Park.[326]\nBefore the gathering, Star-Lord tried to convince Gamora to join them one last time, to no avail. Afterwards, Rocket, Peter and Groot traveled to Earth on a submarine-shaped ship. In Central Park, the owners of the Gems reunited: Captain Marvel wielded theReality Stone,Turk BarretttheMind Stone, Star-Lord, Rocket and Groot held thePower Stone, Adam Warlock, Drax andIron Ladprotected the Soul Gem, Doctor Strange held theTime StoneandBlack WidowtheSpace Stone. Strange proposed they all work together for the sake of the Gems, but tensions ran high, and even higher when they received a vision that Thanos had been murdered. The Watch argued whether the Stones should leave Earth, and Rocket was against it. There was always a situation that needed handling on Earth, so maybe having the Stones would help them clean up before the rest of the galaxy got involved. When Star-Lord realized his Power Stone was a fake, all hell broke loose and the Watch began fighting each other. It turned out Gamora had stolen the Stone when Peter visited her. She arrived at the Park, calling herself Requiem; she was the one who killed Thanos. She began fighting everyone, and Rocket complained that they should have been called the “janitors” of the galaxy. Proving how unhinged she was, she stabbed Peter.[327]\nLuckily, Peter's life was saved by the Time Stone. Rocket used one of his giant guns to create an explosion and draw everybody's attention — he apologized for mouthing off about that being an Earth problem; in fact it was a Guardians issue. He wanted them to work things out with a team meeting, but Gamora would not listen to reason; she wanted the Soul Stone to recover the missing piece of her soul. The Avengers got involved, but Gamora still won the war and obtained all the stones. She reunited with the piece of her soul in the Soul Stone, but there was a problem — Soulworld had been corrupted. Devondra was a mysterious being that resided in the Soul Gem's Soul World where she devoured any souls that ended getting sent there. It was alleged that if Devondra devoured enough souls, she would be able to weave a new reality from the silk she generated. Due to an imbalance, though, Devondra caused Soul World to transform from a paradise to a hellish wasteland.[328]After retrieving the Infinity Stones, Gamora attempted to rebalance Soul World by folding the universe in half and merging the halves together to formWarp World, a pocket dimension sealed inside Soul World. Once Devondra devoured enough souls in Warp World, Gamora planned to use Devondra's power to create a new reality where there would no longer be any suffering. Groot fused with Star-Lord, but they held Rocket within, because he was hiding inside Groot's wood at the time of the fusion.[329]Loki assembled a team of warps to steal the Stones from Gamora, while Warlock and another team fought Devondra. At the same time, Drax found the Groot-Star-Lord warp, who was living as a regular tree. They joined they fight.[330]Devondra was stopped, and a new universe was created to host all the warps and not undo their lives, while everything was restored to normal outside of the Soul Stone. The Guardians returned to Earth, but Drax stayed behind, choosing to separate his two selves — his Arthur and Drax personas. His time had come to finally rest. Gamora was also sent away, as she had committed too many crimes and had to seek redemption. Regardless, Warlock knew people would always fight over the Stones, so he chose to give them consciousness, and the Stones flew off to choose their own destinies. The Infinity War was over.[331]\nBefore they could decide if they were still a team, the remaining Guardians received a distress call from Earth — New York was being swarmed by what seemed like aliens. Rocket, Peter and Groot tried to identify them, but they came up blank. In the end, it turned out they were fake aliens created by supervillainMysterio.[332]\nAfterwards, Rocket set off on his own with Groot, but a space bug calledSpace-Lubberdrained their ship's engine. In the middle of that crisis, Groot's body was possessed by the consciousness ofShuri, Black Panther's sister.[333]Black Panther was lost in space, so Shuri astral-projected into space to find him, but ended up in Groot. The Lubber drained everything in the ship except for the stereo, so they crashed on a planet. Shuri realized it was the music that attracted the bug, and Rocket cursed Star-Lord's infectious mix-tapes. Shuri tried fighting the Lubber, but it had an electric force-field. As they both had superior intellects, Shuri and Rocket realized at the same time that the monster's head was acting as a tesla coil, and they had to smash it. To counter its field, they began building an extraction electrode — Shuri could keep up with Rocket, which impressed him. The gizmo worked and the bug lost its shield, but the ship lost power completely and the music stopped, which caused the bug to rise its shield again. Shuri had to begin singing herself to distract the bug and get it to lower its shield. She then used Groot's body to beat it up. They managed to leave, but the ship lost its music, stolen by the bug. Soon after, Shuri's astral projection ended and she left Groot's body. Rocket found himself missing her.[334]\nLater, Rocket and Star-Lord were invited to Earth to join The Thing's bachelor party; the ex-Guardian was about to get married. They joined his other friends as he played wrestling. When they went to get drunk on a bar, they were attacked by theSerpent Society. This was precisely what Thing didn't want; when you get too many superheroes together you attract trouble. After dealing with them, they played poker, but it was strip poker. Everybody lost toThundra, so all the males got naked, Rocket included. After a good humored fight broke out, everybody headed home.[335]\nAfter the Infinity Wars, the only remaining Guardians were Rocket, Star-Lord, and Groot. When Rocket began suffering headaches and fur loss, he realized the experiments to make him anthropomorphic were coming undone. His body was shutting down, rejecting whatever modifications they did. He didn't want anyone to take care of him, to go back to being soft like when he was a feral pet for the loonies; he didn't want to be put in some pitiful hospital and forgotten like Khevix, the man for which he used to be a service animal. For all these reasons, and because he didn't want his teammates to see him ruined, because he wanted to choose how he'd be remembered, he grabbed a space pod and left the team without telling anybody.[5]\nSince his days were counted, Rocket decided to settle his debts and get things back to zero. He visited Earth to return all the stuff he'd stolen, to put everything back where it belonged. However, when he entered a store they refuse to serve him; people started screaming and freaking out and the police were called in.Hercules, a superhero that was passing by, got involved and captured Rocket, but Rocket explained it was all a misunderstanding. Suddenly, the Earth's sun went dark and everything was covered in darkness. A portal opened and the duo was visited by a team ofHawkeye,Scarlet Witch,Spectrum, The Vision,Voyager, and Hulk, who recognized Rocket. The raccoon tried to get away from all the craziness, but Hulk grabbed him and they all teleported to the source of the trouble:Mount Olympus. All the Greek Gods had been killed, and they faced their killer and the woman who cast the night throughout the universe,Nyx.[336]All the heroes fought her, and Rocket tried shooting her, but she could teleport away. Voyager realized Nyx was acting as a distraction while her children collected the shards of her soul to grant her full power, so she teleported the Avengers to the locations of the shards. Rocket, Hulk and Hawkeye were teleported to theworldofNightmare.[337]There, they were forced to live out their greatest fears, and Rocket relived the moment he was granted intelligence and the traumatic surgery that came with it.\nThe pain was an old song for him, a symphony of dejá vu with a chorus of razors. It was worse this time; this time he knew what the robot doctors wanted. They wanted something that could take their place, do the job they were bored with, they wanted to mutate a therapy animal into a warden for a cosmic asylum, into a Ranger. He'd blocked it out, but it festered inside, what was done to him, what he'd do back if he ever had the chance again. And then he had it. Rocket grabbed a surgical laser and destroyed the robots, and as he escaped he began realizing something wasn't right. He got his ranger costume magically and none of his animal friends were around; he wanted to find one face from those days, just one. Learning to be careful what you wished for, Rocket found Hulk, who was choking Hawkeye. When Rocket met the green guy, he'd never hurt a soul, but now he was different, darker. Hesitating, Rocket asked him nicely to put Hawkeye down, and Hulk complied grimly. Then reality shifted, and they met the lord of the place: Nightmare. It looked pretty bad, but Rocket figured there was still some angle, something he wasn't seeing yet, something that made it worse. Nightmare tried to act grim and imposing and told them they'd help him or he'd make them suffer a never ending nightmare, but Rocket used his super hearing to catch that he sounded more like a salesman. If he was so powerful, how come he needed their help? And how come Rocket could break out of his dream? Intimidated, Nightmare showed them his true form, skinny and weak. He explained he was hiding one of Nyx's soul shards, and her sonHypnoswas attacking his realm with an army of sleeping people immune to Nightmare's power. Hawkeye agreed to help, but Rocket wanted to get paid. Hulk supported that; Nightmare was almost out of power, but Hulk had an idea about the payment. His smile, however, made Rocket uneasy.[338]\nShortly after, the three heroes faced Hypnos' army.[339]Hawkeye bantered with Rocket as they shot down the sleeping hordes; he said it felt like Space Invaders. When Rocket asked about the reference, Clint explained it was this game where you had to kill all the space aliens, then he realized the meaning of his words. Rocket said he felt so, so welcome in his neighborhood, and that that was why the whole galaxy thought Earthers sucked. He then shot down a sleepingKate Bishop.[340]Eventually Hulk killed Hypnos and grabbed his spoils: the soul shard, which he broke to use its power. He used it to locate another shard in planetEuphoria, one capable of ending the world, as this version of the Hulk wanted to destroy the human race.[341]As a reward for helping him, Nightmare offered the team a gate to anywhere. Rocket wanted to rob a casino, but Hulk convinced them to go to Euphoria. It was a sentient world that made everyone's dreams come true. Rocket could take a break, since it had been a tough couple of days, so he agreed.[342]When they appeared on the planet, however, Nyx was already there. Hulk said he'd take care of it, but Hawkeye started working with Rocket to make a bow – it was “Avengers Assemble”, not “Avengers Take Five”. Rocket loaded an arrow with an antimatter charge, but Nyx deflected them easily. The fight raged on, but ultimately Nyx defeated Hulk, right as the rest of the Avengers arrived, along withConan the Barbarian. However, it was too late; Nyx obtained her second shard from Hulk and all the stars in the sky went out.[343]Suddenly, they were interrupted by Euphoria, the personification of the planet. She was used to granting desires, so to decide who would have the final soul shard she asked everyone present what they wanted. When it came to Rocket, she referred to him as the one whose sadness dwarfed all there. Rocket whispered that he just wanted one thing he ever did to turn out right — then he found a capsule of Pym Particles he stole from Hawkeye. As everyone attacked Nyx together, Rocket used the particle to turn into a giant and join the strike. However, wanting to stop the violence, Euphoria gave Nyx the last piece of her soul, returning her godhood. With it, she could see the center of creation, the home of theOne Above All, theHouse of Ideas. The heroes teleported there, a location in Long Island, Earth. They saw Nyx entering the house and they tried to go after her, but the forces coming from the house were so powerful that only Vision could enter.[344]Vision used the power of creation within to destroy Nyx. Rocket, meanwhile, was whisked away to another planet, to the bathroom of a bar in orbit around Voort-3. Seeing the suns becoming alight again, he knew everything had turned out right. He drank to being an Avenger; something to cross off his bucket list.[345]\nEventually, Rocket's body became so ill he could barely move. He moved to Halfworld, where he withered away in a secluded home. As Halfworld is a gray asylum, but Rocket's resting place was green, it is likely he moved to Halfworld's Enviroputic Bio-Scape, an immersion environment used to pacify the animals. Gamora moved there as well and guarded the place, making sure that if Rocket wanted to die, he wouldn't be killed by any of his enemies first. She was there to bury him. Despite this, Rocket refused to show himself to her or to anyone.[5]Gamora had to leave the place when the new Guardians of the Galaxy came looking for her, suspecting Thanos might have uploaded his consciousness into her. People were going to come to murder her, so she left as to not endanger Rocket.[346]Later, the new Universal Church of Truth captured and brainwashed most of the new Guardians, so Groot and an alternate-universeMoondragonwent to Rocket's house to ask for help. Rocket was in; what had he got to lose? His body was so frail that he had to be hooked to a million cables.[347]Groot confronted Rocket's selfishness, marking that he wouldn't accept anyone's calls or help. Rocket argued that he just didn't want to be remembered like that, but Groot said he didn't belong to just himself; they owed it to each other to keep going, because Rocket wouldn't be there when he died, but the rest would. That was what family meant. Rocket brushed off the corniness, and suited up in a giant mecha suit.[5]After convincing a youngMagusto help them, Rocket and his ragtag group of Guardians attackedthe Church's flagship, where they were confronted bya horde of Drax clonesand then a large contingent of brainwashed cosmic heroes and villains. Rocket and his allies were quickly overwhelmed, and Rocket's battlesuit was destroyed byBeta Ray Bill'sStormbreaker. Thinking Rocket was dead, J'son sent the Guardians and Magus away. However, Rocket survived and was found by miniature clones of Groot.[348]\nWith a weapon provided by the miniature Groots Rocket managed to knock out the guards in the engine room and used his engineering skills to reverse the engines' polarity, gaining control of the targeting systems. Rockets' efforts freed his allies from the Church's captivity while also turning their apathy weapon against them. Rocket and his allies fled the Church's temple using Lockjaw's teleportation power before it traveled back to its native timeline, takinga clone of Draxwith them.[349]In the following weeks, Rocket passed through many surgeries to save his life and the Guardians remained by his side until he was fully recovered.[350]\nStill keeping Rocket company while he recovered on Halfworld, the Guardians were approached by Nova for their assistance in stopping the conquering rampage of theOlympians, who had been reborn as bloodthirsty rogue gods. Nova had come to recruit the Guardians as the Nova Corps had been destroyed by the Universal Church of Truth. Although the alternate-universe Moondragon and Phyla-Vell were eager to help, Gamora explained they weren't a suicide unit eager for every mission, but a family, and denied his request. However, that night Rocket and Star-Lord decided to help Nova anyway. Unbeknownst to Groot and the others, Rocket and Star-Lord joined up with Moondragon, Phyla, Nova and new recruitMarvel Boy.[350]Although the mission was successful and the Dark Olympians were exiled to another dimension, Quill seemingly sacrificed himself to detonate the device that made it possible.[351]Blaming Rocket for Peter's death, Gamora struck him and said he was dead to her. Gamora broke off the team with the Guardians that had stayed behind during the Dark Olympians mission.[352]\nRocket's branch of the team received an emergency call from Daggett's World, where Rocket had recently pulled his Blue River score. Crooked businessmanGnawbarquewas selling a supposed clean energy source which was actually modelled after Galactus, as it consumed a planet's life energy. Knowing Gnarwbarque hated him, Rocket booked himself into a local resort to draw his attention while Marvel Boy infiltrated the Converter, even though Rocket had been informed by Groot that Blackjack was aiming a gun at him from afar. To Groot, Rocket simply said he'd drink to that. Marvel Boy was intercepted by Gamora's Guardians, who had been hired by Gnawbarque to kill Rocket.[353]Unbeknownst to Gamora, she had been psychically pushed by the original Moondragon, who wanted to punish her replacement for being everything she was not. Groot stopped Blackjack from shooting Rocket. After Rocket's team set off an explosion inside the Converter facility, all the Guardians swapped places with Gnawbarque using the Nega-Bands, leaving the beaver to die in his own facility.[354]\nAfter the two branches of the team were reunited, Rocket and the Guardians attended the wedding ofTeddyandBilly Kaplan-Altmanalong with theAvengers, theFantastic Four, theGuardians of the Galaxy, theYoung Avengers, theKnights of the Infinite, Billy and Teddy's former teammates at theNew Avengers, andAbigail Brand, among others.[355]Regardless of the happy occasion, Rocket felt responsible for the loss of Peter and took up heavy drinking.[356]With Gamora having trouble coping as well, Rocket sent her on a mission to seduce a bachelor who had kidnapped hundreds of children. Rocket coached Gamora through an earpiece through the mission, and after it finished they admitted it almost felt like old times.[357]On his own, Rocket took a job on planet Foul Bog 4, on the Outer Galaxy. It was a long way to go for 40,000 credits, but a job was a job. When he got lost in a swamp, he was surrounded by the alien natives, who gave him unwanted attention.[358]\nWhen Groot tried to get Rocket to leave his room, they were suddenly teleported away by LadySif.[356]They were summoned to the Fornites island of Apollo, to help stop Galactus alongsideBrite Bomber,Kit,Raven,Jonesy,Lynx,Peely, Captain America, Storm, Wolverine, Doctor Doom, She-Hulk, andMystique.[359]Once Rocket and Groot came back, they agreed never to speak of it again.[356]Later, Rocket was called to investigate the murder ofStote, high emperor of theSn'rxat a galactic diplomatic conference Marvel Boy was attending. After he figured out it was caused by theProfiteer, an Elder of the Universe, everyone in the room was informed the god of Darkness Knull was destroying entire planets.[360]While protecting Spartax, Rocket and Nova found Peter alive and well, returned from the other-dimensional world ofMorinus, where he had spent a hundred of years of his life, albeit unaging.[361]Rocket wanted to go help Earth against Knull, but Peter explained they'd endanger anywhere he's near because he stole half the Dark Olympians' power, and they'd be coming back for it.[362]\nFollowing the ultimate defeat of the Dark Olympians, the Guardians of the Galaxy were sanctioned by theGalactic Councilas protectors of the cosmos in light of the increasing uncertainty of the galactic landscape, providing them with headquarters in the space stationProscenium.[363]\nAround this time,Phil Coulsonsold his soul toMephistoand obtained thePandemonium Cube, a demonic artifact capable of warping reality. With it, he rewrote the timeline so that theSquadron Supreme of Americawere the supreme superhero team of Earth instead of theAvengersas the Avengers were never formed.[364]This had a ripple effect, and Rocket's life was modified as well, with Rocket joining theStarjammersinstead of the Guardians, becoming theStar Brandand eventually dying. For more information of Rocket's modified biography, seeRocket Raccoon (Earth-21798). Eventually,Earth-616was restored, and Rocket was never aware he died.[365]\nAmong the Guardians of the Galaxy missions as sanctioned super-heroes of the galaxy, Rocket helped stop an attack from theProgenitorsonThroneworld II, who were sicced on the planet byOrbis Stellaris. Afterwards, the team was attacked by Doctor Doom,[366]but he was stopped by tricking him into swapping bodies with Rocket. Heeding Doom's words of an upcoming threat, they forced him to join the Guardians. At the same time,Ego The Living Planetturned into a black cocoon.[367]Later, Rocket and the team had a meeting with the new King in Black,Eddie Brock. He alerted them of the upcoming threat ofThe Maker, who at some point in the future was going to try to replaceEarth-616with his own.[368]Twelve days after Ego's transformation, Rocket surveyed it from theAlmondspaceship when it cracked open to revealDormammu.[369]He released a horde ofMindless Ones, which destroyed the Almond. Rocket floated in space without oxygen before Nova rescued him.[370]Dormammu attacked Aerie,Skrullos,Hala,Chitauri PrimeandSpartaxto draw a galaxy-sized summoning circle, potentially to merge reality with his Dark Dimension, or worse. Rocket laid out a dispatchment plan he concocted with Doom, but was dismayed when Nova told him he simply did not trust Rocket with Peter and Gamora on the line.[371]S.W.O.R.D.agreed to work with Rocket's plan, however, and he met up withCable, who regarded the raccoon with respect as he was a galactic folk hero in the future Cable came from. Rocket sent Cable to steal a planet-sized gun fromBreakworldwhile he engineered a giant bullet out ofMysterium.[372]The bullet ended the threat of Dormammu, and the Guardians later celebrated atGosnell's.[373]\nThe Guardians answered another emergency call when Captain Marvel reported she was under attack byVox Supreme, and the Guardians arrived to help along with the Avengers.[374]Together, they defeated Vox and his army ofSludges.[375]Later, the Guardians assisted the Fantastic Four against an attack by theProsilicanswith help of the Starjammers, the Imperial Guard, theHeralds of Galactus, theUnparalleled,the Shi'ars, and the Kree/Skrull alliance.[376]Together, they freed Ego, The Living Planet, and took the fight to the Prosilicans.[377]Upon victory, Rocket and all the other soldiers witnessed as The Watcher dissolved a great barrier hiding nine tenths of the universe, revealing new borderlands of infinite possibilities. Uatu restored all the damage and losses from the war and promised to never interfere away as he whisked everyone to their places of origin. As the Guardians were teleported away, Rocket remarked he'd believe that when he saw it.[378]Rocket was later contacted byRogue, whom he called the only person who was allowed to call him \"Rocky.\" Rocket had been gambling on Gameworld, and the X-Men wanted information.[379]He told them the casino gambled with planets, laundered money and they had psi-alarms as security. The X-Men later acted on it.[380]Rocket had regular dealings with Rogue, and she texted him for relationship advice about her marriage withGambit.[381]On another adventure, Rocket directed Mantis and Groot to a planet that had been causing nearby ships to crash. There, Mantis found a piece of her fragmented identity and decided to assume a pink skin color.[382]Later, Rocket and the Guardians collaborated with Loki (disguised as a cat), Captain Marvel, her cat Chewie, Thor and his dogThorito defeat a space alien. Afterwards, they all took a shower.[383]One one occasion, Peter hosted a screening of the movie Motorcycle Psychos for Rocket and the other Guardians. While watching it,Moondragonreceived a psychic attack by the Grandmaster in an attempt to destroy the Guardians from within, but she resisted him. When she woke up, the Guardians picked up the Grandmaster's ship on their radar, and took the fight to him.[384]\nLater, Rocket was spotted drinking in the club Astar X, in Shi'ar space, in the company of Howard the Duck, Yondu and the Starjammers.[385]He was also spotted getting lunch inDamage Control'sFlatiron Building, along with Howard, Wolverine,Morbius, Stephen Strange andBlade.[386]Because of all the inactivity, the Guardians started getting in each other's nerves. To ease that, Peter invited them to Gosnell's Bar, where they were approached by Graybar, a subject of Blaastar in the Negative Zone. He gave them notice of a plan to transmit an antimatter pulse that would destroy all positive-matter life, so the Guardians headed to Blaastar's fort, although Rocket asked for a group hug and a photo in vain. During the infiltration, Graybar died, but his sacrifice motivated the Guardians to set aside their conflicts and live up to their name. After taking down Blastaar, his people rejoiced, and promised to imprison or exile him for all time in his home planet ofBaluur. The Guardians returned to Gosnell's to celebrate, wherein Rocket asked once again for a group hug and a photo.[387]One evening, the Guardians decided to sleep in Knowhere, but Rocket was awakened along with everyone else when Drax and Ronan played a dancing video game by stomping their feet too loudly. Rather than get mad, everyone joined in on the game.[388]Later, Rocket asked Cosmo to watch a dangerous weapon called Fermion Projector while he ran some errands.[389]Even later, Groot caught a cold which caused his mucus to sprout folliage. When Cosmo placed him near a water source, Groot's flowers spread all over Knowhere, spoiling one of Rocket's weapons.[390]One day, Cosmo warned Rocket not to play with Knowhere's power generator, but Rocket did it anyway to install a new, top-of-the-line security system. However, he caused an outage. As Silver Surfer was nearby, he provided the station with power while Rocket fixed things, but the raccoon couldn't concentrate with Cosmo's scoldings. Taking a break, Rocket and Cosmo went for a walk and played fetch, but Silver Surfer accidentally overcharged the station, launching an escape pod with Cosmo inside. After Silver Surfer retrieved the dog, Rocket apologized and revealed his new security system.[391]\nWhen the Guardians learned that weapons called Prodigals, made of the asteroid-children of Ego the Living Planet, were going to be sold in the Casino Andromeda, they teamed up with the Avengers to retrieve the four different asteroids.[392]Rocket and Groot paired up with Ant-Man, who had forgotten his time on the Guardians, and were tasked with breaking into the Casino's vault. After several mistakes, such as Rocket triggering Ant-Man's allergies, or Rocket's disguise being found out by a telepath guard because he couldn't stop thinking \"Blam, murdered you,\" the trio triggered the alarms, releasing a swarm of Broods. Luckily, Ant-Man realised that as bugs, his helmet could control the Brood, and they escaped with the case, only to be assaulted by The Collector.[393]The Collector activated his Prodigal, causing a beacon call and collapsing the casino on itself. Using a ship named Somerville, Rocket helped Groot, Gamora, Captain Marvel andWar Machinedestroy falling debris and rescue trapped people, commanding Carol to charge Groot with solar energy so that he'd grow and restore the oxygen levels. Although Ant-Man defeated the Collector, the Prodigal summoned Ego.[394]Rocket, Carol and Drax flew to Ego's surface, where Rocket shot a mixture of chemicals and ice crystals to cause acid rain, serving as a distraction while Gamora and Ant-Man flew inside Ego. Gamora shot a bow with Ant-Man in it directly into Ego's heart, where Scott used Pym Particles to shrink Ego to human size. Ego lashed out, which allowed Carol to peek inside his mind and understand the Prodigal were his asteroid-children. After reuniting the \"family,\" Ego left. Rocket tried to convince War Machine to sell him his suit, and both the Avengers and the Guardians gambled in the Casino until they had enough money to repair the Guardians' ship.[395]\nAfter Nebula joined the Guardians, Knowhere was attacked by Galactus, and Rocket faced him alongside his fellow Guardians, the Starjammers, the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, Photon, Ronan, Beta Ray Bill and Nova. Although the world eater briefly knocked Rocket out, he was driven away when Cosmo created a telepathic projection ofhis mother.[396]\nWanting to be a force of good within the Guardians, Nebula combined the probability engine in her head with the Guardians' threat data to create an early-warning system that pointed to Groot's homeworld as the most likely threat vector to galactic peace. When Groot and Rocket landed on it, they found the planet razed to the ground. The very first Flora Colossus and last survivor, Granopy, infected Groot with one of her branches, turning Groot into an out-of-control monster. During the transformation, a wild branch took Rocket's eye out. As Groot became planet-sized, getting designated \"Grootfall\", he took out most Guardians members and the Proscenium. As every surviving member blamed themselves, the Guardians disbanded.[397]Rocket came to settle on Planet Refuge, a world in the Manifold Territories that acted as a safe haven for those whose planets had been consumed by Grootfall. During his time there, he constructed a robotic replica of Groot and took on a new identity: the Star-Sheriff. In protecting the planet's inhabitants, he used an orbital cannon to kill well over one hundred Groots for over a year, though he still believed that there would be a way to bring his old friend back. After another Grootfall led to the death of his robotic companion and the destruction of his ship, he was beamed onto the Guardians' newest ship, where Star-Lord revealed that he may have found a way to save their friend.[398]The Guardians approached Groot and tried to communicate with him, but ended up getting swallowed up by the monster.[399]Although they believed themselves dead, they found out they could still communicate in some sort of liminal space within Groot. There, they set their differences aside and bonded with Groot.[397]Renaming themselves the Guardians of Grootspace, Rocket and his fellow Guardians were able to spawn in the physical world in the form of Groot branches, and for months they helped protect Groot as he spread throughout all of the Manifold Space. They understood now that Groot's fire asteroids intended to create ash for new trees to grow, respawning Groot's species while protecting all other life forms caught in the process under Groot's soil. When Emperor Hulkling and Wiccan visited planet Solitude, Rocket and the Guardians showed themselves to them and explained them the purpose of Grootfall. The royals left, promising to keep the Galactic Council from entering Grootspace until he could reach \"full bloom.\"[400]\nIn the days leading up to the bloom, Rocket and the Guardians knew peace like never before. All the while, Rocket began building a pocket sun. While taking out the last faction fighting it out in Grootspace, the Whitecaps, the Guardians learned that them, alongside the Branchworlds, Planet X and Groot, were a creation of The Gardener. The Whitecaps acted as pollen, and Grootfall was a natural mechanism to rekindle dried roots when there was nothing new to pollinate. The Guardians added the Whitecaps' territory, along with the Granopy, whom they worshipped, to Grootspace. Later, the team received a message from Emperor Dorrek warning them that Queen Victora of Spartax was going to attack Grootspace.[401]The Spartax Empire didn't take long to arrive[402]and open fire. Rocket deployed his pocket sun, and the plan was to trigger it remotely, but Victoria began firing at it, uncaring of the fact that the sun's explosion would decimate her armada. Rocket accepted the only remaining couse of action was to trigger it from the inside, but he admitted he didn't want to die.[403]Drax took Rocket's place, sacrificing himself by activating the pocket sun. As Groot had promised, his bloom brought all the fallen by Grootfall back to physical space, including fellow members Kl'rt, Quasar, Moondragon, Phyla Vell, Noh-Varr, and Hercules. Rocket and the rest of the Guardians of Grootfall were taken out of Groot, too, and stopped being composed of vegetable matter. After Victoria saw the error of her ways and ceased fire, everyone celebrated together, but Rocket met with Groot privately and scolded him for what he put his friends through. In the end, though, Rocket admitted he'd missed Groot.[404]\nLater, hoping to get a little rest and relaxation away from Knowhere, Rocket went on an excursion to an alien planet with Cosmo, Jeff the Land Shark, Chewie the Flerken,Coal,Ghost Rider's cat,Liho, Black Widow's cat, andAlpine, the Winter Soldier's cat.[405]Some time later, Rocket was surprised as he woke up to see the pets's friend, Twigly, through his window. The pets overran Knowhere, and all of the Guardians complained to Cosmo, who assured them the pets would only stay for a day. Rocket tried to go on with his routine, fixing some wires with help of Liho andBats, Doctor Strange's ghost dog. Later, the Guardians assembled all the pets and wished them a happy journey as they stepped through a portal to Earth. Rocket was nonchalant, until Drax hugged him, tearfully declaring he'd miss Chewie.[406]Around this time, Rocket planned to use one of the Guardians' ships, theSomerville, to go drinking with Peter, but Hercules stole the vehicle to answer a call for help from planetCiegrim-7, leaving Rocket stranded and grumpy.[407]Later, Chewie the Flerken had many kittens. Captain Marvel donated them to all her acquaintances, giving some to Rocket so he could help find them homes. Eventually, Chewie missed her kittens, so Carol hosted a little get-together of the Flerkens inAladnawith Rocket, Tic,Jackie Lrurt,Yan, andGil.[408]\nWhen the galaxy was threatened by an alliance between Thanos andPerrikus,Phoenixsummoned Rocket, Nova, Captain Marvel andSifto help.[409]Using a plan devised by Carol, Rocket hacked into the Black Order's communications and, faking Thanos's voice, led them to an ambush away from their leader. While Rocket and the team engaged the Black Order, Phoenix took the fight to Thanos. However, the Mad Titan gained the upper hand, and threatened to use the Phoenix's energy to destroy the entire universe. Rocket and the rest focused their efforts on stopping Thanos, giving Jean enough time to surrender her power to prevent the Eternal from abusing it. With Jean powerless, Thanos summoned the woman namedAdani, to whom the Phoenix had gone to.[410]The fight between Adani and Jean fused the two into a psychic cocoon. Rocket and Nova took post watching it, with Rocket shooting at it for hours in an attempt to free Jean. After that proved pointless, eventually Jean broke free on her own, transformed.[411]\nAfter having been in the Guardians together, Doctor Doom acknowledged Rocket as his intellectual peer. Upon becoming Earth'sSorcerer Supreme, Doom invited Rocket toLatveriaso that the raccoon could help him device a method to travel before theBig Bang, upon which Doom would try to understand the purpose of the universe and life's suffering. After thirteen days in which Doom told Rocket his life story, Rocket successfuly cracked the problem, and the two traveled back in time to before time had been created. There, their time machine was boarded by a humanoid being who had no notion of any concepts, because any concepts hadn't been created yet. It reached towards the piece of Doom's soul that powered the ship, and, upon touching it, the being expanded and gave birth to the universe, empowered by Doom's desire to understand existence. The being pontificated on how the purpose of the universe was to understand the purpose of the universe, and when that question is answered, the process will begin again. Back in Latveria, Rocket went back to the Guardians, but before departing he pressed onto Doom the importance of understanding that they now knew the universe was created in Doom's image, and everything that could mean.[412]\n10,000 to 15,000 years into the future ofReality-7614, Rocket met Ithacon princeWayfinderon the planet Hailailae, aka Witchworld, where he aided the off-world Prince by instructing him about the dangers of Witchworld, and helped him battle the animal men of the sorceress Kirke.[413]How Rocket survived the intervening millennia, or if he was somehow transported to or from there through space/time, remains unrevealed.[9]"

However, as Gogol later learned, the psychologist was an extraterrestrial, and the hypnosis unlocked Gogol's innate superhuman potential. Donning a staggeringly gaudy costume, Gogol became the superhero Captain Ultra; however, he suffered from severe pyrophobia (fear of fire).\nCaptain Ultra's first appearance was as an applicant to the supervillain team called theFrightful Four; he was at first enthusiastically accepted by the other three villains, ecstatic at his large array of powers. However, when one of them began to light a cigarette in celebration, he fainted in the presence of the match; he was promptly rejected.[2]He eventually overcame his pathological fear of fire thanks to years of extensive therapy underDoc Samson.[3]\nOriginal costume\nDollar Billcreated a television documentary about theDefenders, and personally invited super-humans to join the team. Captain Ultra was one of many super-heroes who traveled toRichmond Riding AcademyonLong Island, the Defenders' headquarters, to apply for a position. He briefly served with theDefenders for a Day.[4]\nCaptain Ultra and a few of the other new arrivals were greeted by veteran DefenderHellcat. Hellcat started flirting with Captain Ultra, and he tried to impress her. Soon enough, Captain Ultra andJack of Heartsstarted competing for the attention of Hellcat. Captain Ultra got territorial and started arguing with Jack. Hellcat realized they were about to fight and tried to calm them down. Ultra accused her of \"playing the field\" and toying with them. He shoved her angrily aside, an action which Jack found insulting. They started arguing again and exchanging insults. Their argument was about to get into a fist fight, but they had failed to notice four other Defenders on horseback who were approaching them. Ultra and Jack were nearly trampled by the horses.[4]\nCaptain Ultra witnessedHercules' attempt to take charge of the team, and listened to his speech. He thought that the man was a \"windbag.\"[5]When the Defenders split into three groups in order to investigate a crime spree inNew York City, Captain Ultra was chosen to serve in the group that was led by Hercules. While the rest of the group used theHellcatmobile, there was no space in the car for Ultra. He simply flew behind the car. Hercules' group came into conflict with a team ofvillainous Defenders, which was serving underSagittarius. Thelocal policearrived and attempted to arrest both groups.[5]\nWhen the villainous Defenders escaped the police, the heroes chased them on foot. Captain Ultra was the only member of the group who could fly, rather than run. The second battle between the two groups took place inGrand Central Station. Captain Ultra fought againstWhirlwind, who taunted Ultra about his \"eyesore\" of a costume.[6]\nWhen the villains took over a subway train and escaped, Captain Ultra used his \"scanner vision\" to see through the pavement and track down the train from the surface. Ultra flew ahead and gave directions to the other members of the group, but the other Defenders where much slower than him.[6]During the third battle between the two groups, theBlobwas able to hold Hellcat in a stranglehold. Her fellow Defenders were too preoccupied with their own fights to take notice and help her. Hellcat's air supply was running out and she realized that she was dying. Her still developing psychic powers lashed out blindly, and blasted every hero and villain in her vicinity. Captain Ultra was knocked out, as were all the other heroes and villains present (except Hellcat herself).[6]Hercules' group of Defenders soon disbanded, with the members going their own way. Captain Ultra presumably left with the others.[7]\nSoon after, he moved toChicago. He has since had a minor career as a solo superhero, often teaming up with heroes likeThorto battle minor villains.\nAfter theCivil War, he was listed as a potential recruit for theInitiative,[8]and became the leader for theNebraskateam of theInitiative program, part of a government controlled superhero program. AfterParagon, one of his team, killed fellow teammateGadget, Griffin briefly foughtIron Manto protect the rest of his group. He was seen investigating the circumstances of Paragon and Gadget's tragic deaths with Doc Samson and Iron Man. During the course of their investigation, it was revealed that there were two new Initiative recruits in the process of being fast-tracked to the Nebraska team, although Captain Ultra expressed irritation at the prospect of having to \"babysit the punks.\"\nLater, he joinedWonder Man'sRevengersand successfully attacked theAvengers Mansion.[9]He was defeated by the combined forces of theAvengersandNew Avengers, and while being interrogated, explained his participation by jealousy and bitterness for being ignored when he asked to join the Avengers.[10]\nSomeone who looks like Captain Ultra was seen as an inmate ofPleasant Hill.[11]"

Years before he became the Super-Skrull, he was a decorated soldier in the Skrull army. This led a wealthy Skrullian countess from the planetZaragz'nato be betrothed to him.[23]He spawned two children, a son,Sarnogg,[17]and a daughter,Jazinda.[18]Kl'rt favored his son and despised his daughter.[22]However, Kl'rt's duty and devotion as a soldier kept him away from his family, most notably when he fought in theBattle of Harkoon.[17][23]However, after a string of defeats, the disgraced Kl'rt was turned away by his mate, banished from Z'aragz'na, and was no longer allowed to see his son. Over the years Kl'rt secretly kept tabs on his old life.[23]\nKl'rt as an adult\nWhen Jazinda grew to adulthood she sought to win her father's respect and joined the Skrull army herself. While on a mission to recover the Sy-Torak Gem from theKreeempire, she was caught in the act. She swallowed the gem and it permanently bonded to her body. Discovering that she could not die with the gem in her system, and that its removal would kill her, Jazinda went into hiding. This failed mission put shame upon Kl'rt's home and he vowed to one day find his daughter and kill her for the disgrace she put upon their family.[22]Meanwhile, Sarnogg underwent his first hunt, an event which Kl'rt witnessed from a distance as he was not allowed to attend.[23]\nThe Super-Skrull battles the Fantastic Four for the first time[2]\nUnder the rule ofEmperor Dorrek VII, Kl'rt became the first Super-Skrull. He was endowed with the powers of theFantastic Fourand sent to Earth to conquer it after the Fantastic Four thwarted their previous invasion attempt.[24]With powers that were stronger than his foes', the Super-Skrull was more than a match against the Fantastic Four. The team's leader,Mr. Fantastic, deduced that Kl'rt's powers were artificial and beamed to him from theSkrull throneworld, so he built a jamming device that cut off the Super-Skrull's power source. Powerless, Kl'rt was imprisoned inside a dormant volcano.[2]\nKl'rt posing as the Invincible Man[7]\nStill seeking revenge against the Fantastic Four, Dorrek had his scientists boost the transmission signal, allowing the Super-Skrull to break free of the volcano months later. Under orders, Kl'rt took the place ofFranklin Storm, father of the Fantastic Four'sInvisible GirlandHuman Torch. At the time, Franklin was serving time in prison for vehicular manslaughter. Posing as Franklin, the Super-Skrull broke out of jail and fashioned the identity of the \"Invincible Man\", using his \"familial\" connection to the Fantastic Four to force them to hold back while he committed a crime spree. However, noticing that their foe replicated all their powers, Reed correctly deduced that the Invincible Man was really the Super-Skrull in disguise. Reed then constructed a weapon and threatened to destroy the Skrull Throneworld unless Dorrek agreed to cease his hostilities. The Super-Skrull was teleported back to his homeworld and Franklin Storm was returned. However, the Skrulls planned a double-cross as they had planted a bomb on Franklin to destroy the Fantastic Four. Franklin instead sacrificed his life, shielding the FF from the blast, saving their lives and dying a hero.[25]\nWhen Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl were to be married, their old foeDr. Doomcreated an Emotion Changer device and used it to draw in an army of super-villains to attack the wedding. Among those who were drawn in for the attack was the Super-Skrull. Kl'rt failed to get close to the wedding as his ship was destroyed by theAsgardianthunder godThor[26]who then defeated him in hand-to-hand combat.[27]Ultimately the Super-Skrull and the other villains were sent away by Mr. Fantastic who was given a Time Displacer device by theWatcherwhich shunted all their foes back in time to prior to the attack and with no memory of what happened.[26][27]That Christmas Eve, the Super-Skrull made yet another attack on the Fantastic Four, this time while they were celebrating Christmas at their headquarters in theBaxter Building. Although details pertaining to this battle are minimal, Kl'rt was easily defeated and likely escaped.[28]For his past failures the Super-Skrull was put on patrol duty. It was here that he was manipulated by the Asgardian trickster godLoki. Under Loki's influence, Kl'rt returned to Earth to attack Thor. Thor proved to be more than a match for the Super-Skrull, and using his enchanted hammerMjolnircreated \"anti-force\" rays to send him out of Earth's orbit, with a warning to stay away from Earth in the future.[29]\nSoon the Skrulls' eternal enemies, the Kree, became interested in the planet Earth once again.[30]Seeing that decorated Kree soldierCaptain Mar-Vellwas among those exploring the Earth, Emperor Dorrek sent the Super-Skrull back to Earth to learn what he could about the Kree activity there. Using a device to track Mar-Vell's uniform by its unique \"radiation factor\", the Super-Skrull came uponJeremy Loganwho rented a room to Mar-Vell in his human guise of Dr. Walter Lawson. Logan, suspecting that Lawson was some kind of spy who was attempting to bring a cylinder of his equipment to turn over to the military atCape Canaveral, unaware that its internal security was set to explode.[31]Kl'rt knocked out Mar-Vell and attempted to probe his mind and learned that aKree Sentrywas in the custody of the United States military. Disguising himself asWalter Lawson, the Super-Skrull took the cylinder and attempted to infiltrate the base, but Captain Marvel broke free and took back the cylinder. When Kl'rt attempted to use his Skrullian hypnotic abilities, Mar-Vell activated lenses on his helmet that reversed their power onto the Super-Skrull. Mar-Vell then ordered the Skrull to forget his mission and leave the Earth, ending his threat.[11]\nKl'rt vs Captain Marvel[6]\nAfter this most recent failure, the Super-Skrull sought to regain the favour of Emperor Dorrek when theKree-Skrull Warfinally resumed all out warfare. To this end, Kl'rt revivedthree Skrull spieswho were trapped in the form of Earth cows.[32]He then had afourth spyreplace US politicianH. Warren Craddockto spread xenophobic hysteria and start a government sanctioned witch hunt for aliens that were active in the United States.[33]\"Craddock\" specifically incited hatred of Kl'rt's old foe Captain Marvel and his allies the Avengers who were \"harbouring\" him. When an angry mob formed outside ofAvengers Mansion, the Super-Skrull posed as Mar-Vell's allyCarol Danversand convinced him to follow \"her\" to \"safety\". After their departure, the Avengers were grilled by \"Craddock\" at the Commission for Alien Affairs. Back at Avengers Mansion the three Skrull spies posed as senior Avengers Thor,Iron Man, andCaptain America, tricking the current roster and ordering them to disband.[34]The disbanded Avengers then went looking for Mar-Vell, tracking him to a farm where \"Carol Danvers\" stated they were going to hide out. There they were attacked by the three spies, who took on the forms of Mr. Fantastic, the Human Torch, and theThing. During the battle theVisionwas injured and escaped, but theScarlet WitchandQuicksilverwere captured. Meanwhile, Mar-Vell and \"Carol\" broke free from their bonds and \"Danvers\" tricked Mar-Vell into building anOmni-Wave Projectorwhich Kl'rt plotted to use as a weapon against the Kree. Realizing this deception, Mar-Vell destroyed the Projector, but was too late to prevent the Super-Skrull from knocking him out, and fleeing the scene with Mar-Vell, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch as his prisoners.[6]\nThe Super-Skrull then attempted to attack theGreat Refugeof theInhumans, but found it too well protected. The Vision also had stowed away aboard his ship and attempted to attack, but fled when he realized he could not stop Kl'rt without harming his prisoners and opted for another means of saving them. Kl'rt then brought his prisoners back to the Skrull Throneworld hoping to use them to win favour back from Dorrek VII and hopefully win the hand ofPrincess Anellein the process. Dorrek however was unimpressed with the Super-Skrull's arrival and sedated him and took the prisoners as his own. Dorrek also hoped to force Mar-Vell to create an Omni-Wave Projector.[35]Kl'rt was imprisoned and when Princess Anelle decided to betray her father by helping free Mar-Vell, the Super-Skrull -- loyal to the princess -- changed his shape into that of Mar-Vell in order to cover for them, giving them the time they needed to get away,[5]which the Avengers won with the help of their allyRick Joneswho halted the Kree/Skrull War by utilizing the Destiny Force to immobilize both the Kree and Skrull armies.[36]\nEscaping captivity, the Super-Skrull and another Skrull renegade namedSkraggjoined up an army of other rogue aliens under the command of the Mad Titan namedThanos.[37]The pair were sent to Earth to drive Captain Marvel and his human sidekick Rick Jones to insanity using a series of complex holograms, deceptions, as well as framing Jones for the murder ofProfessor Benjamin Savannah.[38]This purpose for driving Mar-Vell mad was to probe Rick Jones' mind for the location of theCosmic Cubefor Thanos to use.[39]When Skragg's attempts at psychological torture failed to work, the Super-Skrull attacked directly, but proved to be no match for Mar-Vell who easily defeated him, forcing the two Skrulls to flee the scene.[38]They attempted to capture Mar-Vell a second time by tricking him into fighting the Thing, but Thanos soon grew weary of the battle and intervened. Knocking out the Thing, and killing Skragg Thanos then forced Mar-Vell to switch places with Rick Jones before teleporting them all, save for the Thing, to the Saturnian moon ofTitanhome of theEternals of Titan.[37]On Titan, Thanos managed to get the information from the mind of Rick Jones and left for Earth to recover the Cosmic Cube. He left Kl'rt in charge of operations on Titan, giving him the powerful Unisphere as a weapon to defend it from rebels seeking to reclaim Titan. Mar-Vell was freed from his prison by the EternalsMentorandStarfoxand the trio led a rebellion against the Super-Skrull and his forces. Mar-Vell fought Kl'rt again, smashing the Unisphere on the ground. Beaten within an inch of his life, Kl'rt collapsed in battle and Mar-Vell left him for dead.[39]Mar-Vell ultimately returned to Earth and defeated Thanos with the help of the Avengers.[40][41]\nPosing as Joshua Plague[12]\nSurviving his encounter with Captain Marvel, the Super-Skrull returned to Earth in order to heal from his injuries. Needing astrotopic serums to do so, he created the guise of Joshua Plague and with a robot's aid managed to muscle his way into leading the group of mercenary scavengers known as theRat Pack, much to the chagrin of their original leader, a man known only as \"Number One\".[42]He recruited new members, including Marie DuChailu whom he rescued from being killed by theMaggiaafter she was deposed as the crime queen ofNew Orleans, as well as two death row inmates.[43]\nTheir operations soon interfered with attempts byTigrato resume her human form whenProfessor Leon, one of the fabledCat People, was exposed and apprehended under suspicion of being one of the Rat Pack. Growing angry at their violent attacks, Tigra went after the Rat Pack as they were attacking a nearby Native American reservation. There \"Joshua Plague\" battled Tigra, and used his hypnosis to weaken her.[12]The Rat Pack then fled, taking the object that \"Plague\" sought: an ancientSoul Catcherthat the tribal elders had kept for centuries.[42]Tigra resumed her pursuit of the Rat Pack, as well as that of the Native American hero known asRed Wolfwho sought to avenge his people.[12]Tigra tracked \"Joshua\" and his minions back to their hideout and battled them once again. \"Plague\" proved to be an even more powerful foe while wielding the Soul Catcher. Tigra was easily defeated and as Red Wolf approached their headquarters, \"Plague\" ordered it set to explode while they escaped.[42]\nRetreating to another hideout, Kl'rt had everything he needed and had decided that his allies had outlived their usefulness and used the Soul Catcher to try and kill them. This attempt was interrupted by Tigra and Red Wolf who were able to escape the explosion. During the course of the battle, one of the Rat Pack -- \"Plague's\" most loyal servant, Number 5 -- was revealed to be a robot, prompting the Super-Skrull to cease keeping up his disguise and revealed his true identity.[43]During the ensuing battle, Red Wolf's animal sidekickLobomade off with the Soul Catcher. The Super-Skrull went after Lobo, but he was interrupted from recovering it by Tigra and Red Wolf, and later the police who arrived on the scene. Kl'rt disguised himself as a homeless man, and when Tigra and Red Wolf were arrested, he followed them to the police station. He murdered the chief of police and took his place to get the Soul Catcher from them. Another battle broke out which ended when he attempted to use the device on Tigra. It took his soul instead, trapping him inside the Soul Catcher.[44]The Soul Catcher remained in police custody for months until Tigra eventually recovered it and turned it over to Mr. Fantastic for examination.[45]\nFree from the Soul Catcher[45]\nSome time later, when the heroesSpider-Man,Yellowjacket, and theWaspbattled the villain known asEquinoxinNew York City, their battle took them to the Fantastic Four's Baxter Building headquarters. During the course of the fight, the Soul Catcher was knocked out of stasis.[46]After Equinox was defeated, Spider-Man stayed behind to wait for the Fantastic Four to show up and was attacked by the Super-Skrull who managed to free himself from the Soul Catcher. Spider-Man was greatly overpowered but was granted a reprieve when the Human Torch arrived and lent a hand in the fight. Their battle took them to a nearby train yard where Spider-Man realized that the high tension wires above them blocked out the source of the Super-Skrull's powers weakening him. The Torch was injured in battle, but this gave Spider-Man to devise a crude jamming device, but Kl'rt proved to strong for it to contain.[45]Kl'rt easily trounced Spider-Man and left him for dead. Detecting a nearby Star Drive crystal aboard a passing cruise ship, the Super-Skrull attacked the vessel. Incidentally, Carol Danvers (now secretly the costumed hero known as Ms. Marvel) was aboard the ship and went into action to stop him. Spider-Man arrived shortly after and while the wall-crawler kept the Super-Skrull busy, Ms. Marvel arranged another jammer across the length of the ship. Once activated it dampened Kl'rt's powers significantly enough to weaken him. With the Star Drive becoming active, Ms. Marvel threw it at Kl'rt causing it to activate and sending Kl'rt into hyper-space, and was seemingly lost forever.[47]\nTrapped in hyperspace[47]\nDuring the period when the Super-Skrull was lost in hyperspace, an apparent impostor kidnapped theX-Menknown asWolverineandKitty Prydein order for Skrull scientists to learn more about mutants for afuture invasionplan. Taken aboard a Skrull vessel, both Kitty and Wolverine broke free, and with the help of Captain Marvel defeated this seeming Super-Skrull impostor and were returned to Earth.[48]The fate of this replacement Super-Skrull is unknown as there is no clear indication if he had ever been seen again.\nDuring Kl'rt's time trapped in hyperspace, theSkrull throneworldwas destroyed byGalactus.[49]\nKl'rt was eventually drawn back and reconstituted on Earth thanks to scientists at theMount Logan Cosmic Ray Research Stationlocated in the Canadian Rockies. Instinctively, Kl'rt disguised himself as the Thing in order to avoid detection. While the scientists tried to treat him, Kl'rt revived and murdered most of them. However among the team wasWalter Langkowski, also known as the Sasquatch of the Canadian superhero teamAlpha Flight.[10]During his battle with the Sasquatch, Kl'rt realized that after all the time in hyperspace trapped in theVan Allen Beltshe had come down with a rapid and fatal form of leukemia. Desperate to return back to his homeworld, and unaware that it had been destroyed byGalactusmonths earlier, the Super-Skrull used his hypnotic powers to force Langkowski to build a transmitter to teleport him back home. Underestimating Walter's will power, Kl'rt was too late to realize that Sasquatch was only playing along, and when Kl'rt buckled under another fresh wave of pain, he was pushed into the transporter and seemingly atomized once again.[50]\nPosing as Bobby Wright[51]\nShortly after this, the Super-Skrull was reconstituted by the mystic known asMaster Khanwho was seeking to get revenge against his arch-foe, the heroicIron Fist. The Super-Skrull agreed to help in exchange for a mystical cure for his cancer. Khan then used his powers to transform to disguise Kl'rt as a young boy named \"Bobby Wright\", altering the Skrull's memory so that he himself believed that he was a young Earth boy.[51]The fabricated past of Bobby Wright was that of a boy that was abandoned by his teenage mother at a young age. Bounced from foster home to foster home the boy was prone to running away until one day, as the hoax went, Bobby witnessed a meteor that slammed into the planet's surface. Bobby was infected with alien spores that not only endowed him with powers but also threatened to terminate his \"young\" life.[4]These false memories were meant to further trick Iron Fist and prey on his sympathy to draw him closer to the boy. Khan then monitored the progress of \"Bobby Wright\" by posing as his neglectful guardian, as well as police officer Tyrone King.[51]To complete this deception Khan altered Kl'rt's powers. In addition to his natural shape-shifting powers, he was given the ability to fly without the use of his Human Torch flame, and become intangible. The \"Bobby Wright\" deception was made complete by having this false personality inspired by super-heroes and making him determined to find his \"mother\" before he died. Another deception was in allowing aDr. Westto become aware of and concerned for Bobby's \"condition\" to, manipulating him into wanting to help the \"boy\".\nPosing as Captain Hero[51]\nMeanwhile, Bobby was influenced to seek out theHeroes for Hire, an organization run by Iron Fist with his partner,Power Man. Developing an adult super-hero form and calling himself Captain Hero, \"Bobby\" attacked Power Man at the offices of Heroes for Hire in an attempt to convince him to join their organization. Their fight took them across the city and when Power Man refused to allow Captain Hero to join Heroes for Hire, \"Bobby\" threw a temper tantrum and collapsed a tenement building on Power Man. Seeking the more subtle approach, \"Bobby\" then went to Luke Cage's secondary office at the the Gem Theatre inTimes Squaredisguised as Dr. West. However he arrived just as the real Dr. West finished explaining Bobby's \"origins\". \"Bobby\" then decided to go and try to convince Iron Fist to allow him to join. Changing back into Captain Hero, \"Bobby\" tracked Iron Fist to a nearby hospital where he was checking on people who were injured during Captain Hero and Power Man's battle in the streets. When Iron Fist refused to talk to Captain Hero, the \"youth\" attacked in a rage. Ultimately Iron Fist managed to knock Captain Hero out just as Power Man and Dr. West arrived. Learning of \"Bobby's\" \"terminal illness\" and his desire to find his \"mother\", the two heroes became very sympathetic to his plight. Iron Fist then arranged for \"Bobby\" to be taken toProject P.E.G.A.S.U.S.where he hoped that the scientists there might be able to \"cure\" him of his illness.[4]After spending a few days with \"Bobby\", Power Man and Iron Fist saw him to the plane that would take him to PEGASUS. Iron Fist promised the \"boy\" that he would try to visit him as often as he could.[52]\nBy the time that Iron Fist was able to get security clearance, thanks to some assistance from his friend theFalcon, PEGASUS was being terrorized by the mystical being known asBres, one of the many super-villains held prisoner in the facility for study. Bres was obsessed with stealing the innocence of the facility staff in general, and Bobby in particular. Freed from his confinement, Bres then ordered \"Bobby\" to slay Iron Fist, but the \"boy's\" attachment to Iron Fist caused him to shake off Bres' influence and use his Captain Hero powers to defeat him, a turn of events Bres hardly expected nor was prepared for and he was quickly confined again.[53]While \"Bobby\" was being examined by PEGASUS staff, Master Khan made another attempt to destroy Iron Fist when the hero was brought to his home dimension ofK'un-Lun.[54]Khan's plans were thwarted, and unknown to everyone, even Master Khan, the real Iron Fist was replaced with aH'ylthriimpostorwho took the real Iron Fist's place while the real Iron Fist remained a prisoner of the H'ylthri.[55]\nCaptain Hero's \"death\"[56]\nBy this point \"Bobby\" had taken to sneaking out of Project PEGASUS to hone his powers. Upon returning on one such evening he overheard PEGASUS staff talk about how Bobby's illness was seemingly incurable and he only had a month left to live. When PEGASUS security chiefMichael O'Brientried to console the \"boy\", \"Bobby\" fled the Project facility. As Captain Hero he went seeking out Iron Fist, finding his impostor as he was leading aSHIELDstrike force to destroy an ocean monitoring facility constructed by the god-like being known as theBeyonder. When SHIELD agents accidentally launched nuclear warheads at the facility, both Captain Hero and Iron Fist destroyed them before they could kill the SHIELD agents and directorNick Fury. Shortly after this the Beyonder arrived with Power Man and realizing humans were far too paranoid destroyed his facility anyway and left the heroes and SHIELD agents to ponder his words.[57]Presumably, Bobby returned to Project PEGASUS until his \"illness\" was becoming terminal. The doctors called in bothHenry Pymand Mr. Fantastic to try and treat the boy. With \"Bobby\" seemingly hanging by a thread, the impostor Iron Fist used his own chi to try and keep \"Bobby\" alive. Recalling how Captain Marvel managed to slow the terminal cancer he contracted thanks to hisNega-Bands, Pym created replicas in the hopes that they could help slow \"Bobby's\" own \"illness\". That night as Iron Fist and hospital staff rested, \"Bobby\" awoke to searing pain. In a panic he turned into Captain Hero only to find that the pain persisted. Suspecting that the wrist bands might be the source, \"Bobby\" removed them causing him even greater pain. Unaware of his own strength, Bobby tried to rouse the Iron Fist impostor, but instead beat him to death. Power Man then arrived on the scene just as Captain Hero seemingly disintegrated before his eyes. For a time it seemed that Master Khan's master plan was a success, as Iron Fist appeared to be dead, and his partner Power Man was accused of murdering him and on the run from the law once again.[58]After being dissipated, Kl'rt was returned to his energy form trapped in the Van-Allen Belt around the Earth.[59]\nThe Super-Skrull lives again[59]\nDuring Kl'rt's long absence from theSkrull Empiremuch had changed. During the period in which he was first trapped in the Van-Allen belt the Skrull homeworld was consumed by Galactus,[49]the entire Skrull empire had also lost their ability to shapeshift thanks to a Hyper Wave Bomb.[60]When this weakness was learned by their age-old enemies the Kree empire their centuries old conflict began anew.[61]However, after much conflict, the fragmented Skrull empire began rallying behindEmpress S'Byll, one of six Skrull governors vying for control of the empire. One of S'Byll's first orders was to send one of her troops to Earth to reconstitute the Super-Skrull, which he succeeded in doing at the cost of his own life.[62]The Super-Skrull materialized over the Earth just as theSilver Surferwas arriving to learn the location of thesonof his seemingly deceased loverMantis.[63]When the Super-Skrull learned from the Surfer what had become of the Skrull empire he attacked the Surfer. But the pair were stopped by the Eternals who were charged with the task of collecting the DNA of both the Surfer and the Skrull for theHigh Evolutionarywho planned to advance humanity's evolution. When the pair refused to submit to the tests willingly, the Eternals captured them and forced them back to their home ofOlympia. When they were placed in the \"sunset\" and \"sunrise\" pyramids to be examined, both Kl'rt and the Surfer agreed to work together and combined their powers to break free.\nAlthough the Super-Skrull attempted to abandon the Surfer once freed, the formerHerald of Galactuscame to the Skrull's aid earning his respect when he allowed Kl'rt to flee while he dealt with the Eternals. The Surfer pointed out that Kl'rt was the only Skrull who maintained his shape-changing powers and could be the key to restoring the lost heritage of his entire race and restoring the balance and ending the most recent Kree/Skrull War. While the Super-Skrull flew toward the Skrull Empire, the Surfer convinced the Eternals of the follies their mission entailed. The Super-Skrull, having seemingly forgotten his time working under Master Khan's thrall assumed that it was Empress S'Byll who managed to cure him of his cancer.[59]\nThe Super-Skrull eventually returned to theAndromeda Galaxyand spotting a skirmish between Kree and Skrull space cruisers, entered the fray securing a victory for the Skrulls.[64]During more desperate times the Skrulls had allied themselves with theBadoon, however the Badoon soon betrayed them to the Kree. Under the command of Empress S'Byll, the Super-Skrull tricked the Silver Surfer in helping fight off the Badoon invaders, making it appear that the Surfer was siding with the Skrulls, and ruining the neutrality pact he negotiated for his homeworld ofZenn-La. The Silver Surfer rushed to his homeworld and began fighting off a Kree invasion force, and was ultimately assisted by the Skrull armada including the Super-Skrull. On the planets surface, Kl'rt and Empress S'Byll explained they needed the Surfer's alliance because he was the only one who could assist them in restoring the Skrulls shape changing abilities. It was explained to the Surfer that only a female Skrull could transfer the shape-shifting powers back to their race, and so the Surfer agreed to use hisPower Cosmicto power a device that would transfer the genetic template for shape-shifting from Kl'rt and restore S'Byll's own metamorphic powers. When another Kree fleet threatened Zenn-La, the Surfer, Kl'rt and S'Byll -- now endowed with a highly metamorphic body -- destroyed the fleet, further cementing the Surfer's position in the war on the side of the Skrulls.[65]When the Kree attacked Zenn-La again, this time led by their leaderNenora, Kl'rt and S'Byll assisted the Surfer in fighting them off until the Surfer convinced Nenora not to attack Zenn-La again, a promise that struck the two Skrulls as very strange.[66]\nSeemingly slain by Cap'n Reptyl[67]\nKl'rt and the Surfer returned with S'Byll to her homeworld ofSatrianiwhere she began to restore the shape-shifting powers to her fellow Skrulls to assist in the battle ahead. This process was interrupted by the cosmic being known as theStranger, who sought to examine S'Byll. While the Surfer and Kl'rt attempted to stop him, they only managed to rescue S'Byll thanks to the unlikely interference of the space pirate known asCap'n Reptylwho exchanged his own mutant crew to the Stranger for S'Byll's freedom. Reptyl then offered his aid in the coming conflict with the Kree much to the chagrin of both the Surfer and Kl'rt.[68]By this time Kl'rt was growing to love S'Byll and when he caught her and Reptyl embracing he angrily attacked. The two battled fiercely, but Reptyl turned out to be ultimate victor when he seemingly slew the Kl'rt by ripping his throat out. Believing his ally to be dead, the Silver Surfer then flew him to a nearby planet and dropped him at escape velocity, intending for his body to be incinerated upon entry into the planet's atmosphere.[67]Kl'rt was not dead however and as he plunged down through the planet's atmosphere he began to heal. His inert form was recovered by a Badoon scout craft, but having fully recovered he easily slew all aboard the vessel.[69]Despite his recovery, the Super-Skrull was not involved in the final battle which ultimately saw the end of the Kree/Skrull War for the time being.[70]\nHero of the Skrull people[71]\nThe Super-Skrull revealed his survival to the Skrull race and he was hailed as a hero for his part in restoring the Skrull heritage and the sacrifices he made in the war. However, Empress S'Byll had decided that it was in her best interests to let certain people believe that Kl'rt was slain in the battle, already sending out propaganda making everyone believe that the Super-Skrull seen during the war victories was merely an actor to keep his \"death\" a secret from the people. Initially Kl'rt agreed to follow orders, but after praying to a statue of the war godSl'gur'tthe Super-Skrull was determined to die before suffering dishonour. The Super-Skrull then tracked down Cap'n Reptyl's ship, and despite the immunity granted to the pirate by Empress S'Byll he seemingly killed Reptyl by pulling him out into space and choking him seemingly to death in the vacuum of space. Kl'rt then immediately reported back to the Empress to inform her of what he had done. Furious, S'Byll demoted Kl'rt to serve aboard Commander K'Targh's imperial star fleet until she had need of him in the future. Kl'rt then left in disgrace to follow those orders.[71]\nKl'rt later sought to redeem himself in the eyes of his empress and learned how Rick Jones had written a book about his experiences fighting alongside Earth's heroes and began a book tour. With some loyal followers Kl'rt took over the dying town ofBunkport,Utahand arranged to have Rick's book signing tour to pass through the area for a book signing. When Rick arrived the Skrulls attempted to attack him. When Rick fought them off, Kl'rt tricked Jones by shape-shifting himself to look like the Thing. With Rick's guard down, the Super-Skrull easily knocked him out. They then began torturing Rick mentally and physically to try and learn how he utilized the Destiny Force during the Kree/Skrull War. Meanwhile, Rick's friendsBruce BannerandBetty Rosscame to Bunkport searching for Rick. The Super-Skrull then led them into a trap by posing as a little girl who knew where Rick was. When he took them to where his ship was stashed, the Super-Skrull revealed his true identity and attacked.[72]What Kl'rt didn't expect was that Banner was also the incredible Hulk and met his match when Banner transformed into his monstrous gray form. Inside Kl'rt's ship, Rick managed to break free and activate its engines. During the fight, the Hulk knocked Kl'rt into the ships energy core, causing the ship to explode and seemingly slaying the Super-Skrull and his crew.[69]\nPosing as Iron Fist[73]\nSomehow surviving his encounter with the Hulk, the Super-Skrull somehow came to remember his time under the control of Master Khan and decided to take advantage of this knowledge to advance his own ends. Learning of Iron Fist's part ownership of the Rand-Meachum, he sought outWard Meachum, one of Iron Fist's foes and used his abilities to get him out of prison.[74]Seeking to destroy the Earth, Kl'rt appealed to Meachum's desire for power, offering him his own world to rule and the most beautiful woman in the universe. Meachum agreed and the two conspired to use the financial resources of Rand-Meachum to carry out the Super-Skrull's plan. Provided with knowledge about Iron Fist's personal life, Kl'rt assumed the role of Iron Fist's alter-ego, Daniel Rand. Posing as Danny, he hypnotized Ward's nieceJoy, then owner of Rand-Meachum, into following along with their plan.[75]Then posing as Danny, Kl'rt revealed that Rand was \"still alive\" during a televised conference, much to shock of Iron Fist's former allyColleen Wingand his ex-girlfriendMisty Knight, who was still reeling over the \"death\" of Danny and the disappearances of her last boyfriend, Tyrone King.[76]Correctly suspecting an impostor, Misty and Colleen paid a visit to the Rand-Meachum building and confronted \"Danny\". However, Kl'rt was well versed in Iron Fist's past and was able to replicate his appearance completely as well as manipulate his flame powers to make it appear as though he could create Danny's \"Iron Fist\" attack, destroying Misty's mechanical arm. He then coldly rejected the two women and ordered them out of \"his\" building and out of his life.[8]However Kl'rt's hold on Joy Meachum was becoming harder and harder to maintain requiring him to repeatedly hypnotize her. However they began their expedition into theSavage Land, using hypnotic coercion to force its rulerKa-Zarto follow along with their plans.[77]\nThey began excavating aNuwalidevice out of the ground in the Savage Land. This operation caused the ocean surroundingAntarcticato heat up, putting the kingdom ofAtlantisinto peril. This drew theSub-Mariner, his cousinNamorita, and their allyCarrie Alexanderto the area. Namor went into the Savage Land alone, and found the excavation of the Nuwali device, but was ambushed from behind by \"Iron Fist\" and knocked out.[73]Kl'rt and Ward began to torture Namor to try and learn what he knew, but Namor broke free and fought back against \"Iron Fist\". While Namorita joined the battle, \"Rand\" was knocked away and was surprised to find that Misty Knight had followed him to the Savage Land. Kl'rt then manipulated Knight's emotions and convinced her to side with him. Misty knocked Namorita out with a gunshot to the head and \"Iron Fist\" took her prisoner forcing Namor to surrender in order to save her life. Ward and Kl'rt also capturedPhoebe Marrsanother one of Namor's associates.[78]Namor and Namorita were then freed thanks toShanna the She-Deviland Namor's steed theGriffin. Meanwhile, Misty tried to stop Ward from abusing Phoebe, and Ward decided to let slip their entire plot. Overhearing this and with their mission almost a success, the Super-Skrull decided that the time for pretences were over and shed his disguise.[79]While the Super-Skrull battled Namor and Namorita, Misty convinced Ward that Kl'rt would likely betray him -- or if he wasn't, Ward had to consider the fact that this \"most beautiful woman in the universe\" would be based on the standards of a Skrull -- Convinced that he was being double-crossed, Ward rushed out and tried to trash the Nuwali device, but was burned to death by the Super-Skrull. However, before Kl'rt could complete his mission, Namor smashed the device, forcing the Super-Skrull to abandon his plans and flee the scene.[75]\nReturning to space, the Super-Skrull sought to restore his lost honour and the respect his rulers had of him. During theOperation Galactic Stormconflict, the Skrulls stole a massiveShi'arNega-Bomb destined to the Kree galaxy.[80]When it passed through a warp-gate between the Shi'ar galaxy and Earth's solar system, the ship was attacked by the Avenger known asQuasarwho sought to stop the device from being taken to the Kree galaxy. The Super-Skrull was dispatched to defend the ship and was easily defeated. However Quasar was forced to let the Skrulls continue on their path as the Nega-Bomb's proximity to Earth's sun threatened to destroy it.[81][82]Although the Nega-Bomb was detonated in Kree space,[83]the Avengers punished those who were guilty.[84]Some time after this, during the so-calledInfinity Crusade, the Skrull Empire fell under the sway of theGoddess, furious that his people were being forced into passiveness, and immune to the effects himself Kl'rt went out to search for the being responsible. He tracked the Goddess to her base on the worldParadise Omega. However, the Goddess had detected his approach and sent Thor -- who was loyal to her cause at the time -- to stop him. Kl'rt fared no better against Thor this time and was beat into unconsciousness and left on an asteroid.[85]The Goddess was later defeated by a coalition of super-heroes, mostly from Earth, who opposed the Goddess' plans which would have seen the destruction of the entire universe.[86]\nThe Super-Skrull was later sought out by Thanos once again and drafted into his\"Secret Defenders\", which also included the Pyraxlonian known asGeataras well as Earth born super-villains theRhino,Nitro, and theTitanium Man. Thanos requested that they work together and collect the so-calledOracle of Ancient Knowledgewho was worshipped by the a religious order of monks on the planet H'aarg. He appealed to each of their wants, claiming that the monks were planning a holy war across the galaxy, and appealing to Kl'rt's desire to regain his lost honour, pointing out that stopping this war from happening would assist him in that cause. The Super-Skrull grudgingly agreed to join and the group, led by Geatar, stormed the monastery on H'aarg to collect the Oracle, but found that the monks were skilled and heavily armed fighters and were willing to defend their leader to the death.[87]These \"Defenders\" fought through the H'aarg forces and defenses and found themselves face-to-face with their messiah and were shocked to find that it was a robot. Incapacitating the machine shut down the teleportation defenses the planet, allowing Thanos to teleport down to the planets surface. Thanos then claimed the messiah and abandoned his hired minions on H'aarg.[88]The group tried to flee, but found that their ship was rigged to explode shortly after their arrival on the planet. They attempted to defend themselves, but Kl'rt was knocked out in the fighting. The \"Defenders\" managed to escape thanks to the quick thinking of the Titanium Man, who was able to repair the ships escape pod to make a crude escape from the planet. However the lack of power and oxygen could hardly sustain them and they soon passed out and would have died had Geatar had not activated the distress signal. The group was then rescued by the Silver Surfer and his allyLegacy. When the Surfer intended to take Geatar to answer for his past crimes, the Super-Skrull attempted to defend him, but Geatar agreed to surrender. The Super-Skrull went his own way, vowing to avenge the Surfer's effrontery.[89]\nLater, the Super-Skrull was plucked out of time byAron the Rogue Watcherto battle theFantastic FourandFantastic Force. When Aron was defeated his pawns were returned to their proper times with no memory of the battle.[90]The Super-Skrull returned to Empress S'Byll's command and was designated to command a patrol ship. When they happened upon the Silver Surfer it was during a period when the Surfer had briefly gone insane. Seeing this as yet another opportunity to repair the damage to his reputation, Kl'rt went out to battle the Surfer, but he was unprepared for the near insane cosmic being. The Surfer beat the Super-Skrull within an inch of his life, but decided to let him live to suffer punishment for disobeying orders to attack him.[91]\nGrowing tired of his current lot, the Super-Skrull relocated to the planet Skrell where he allied himself with a group of Skrulls under the command of the super-computer known asIntelligentsia, the Skrulls answer to the Kree Supreme Intelligence.[3]He was later sent on a mission to Earth to destroy a super-powerful young girl namedKelly Kooliqwho could alter reality, someone who the Intelligentsia viewed as a threat. When Kl'rt found the girl he was surprised to see that she did not resist her coming death, but could not bring himself to kill her without a fight. Kl'rt was then attacked by the new Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell) andMoondragonwho came to the young girl's aid. However Kelly also summoned the Silver Surfer to Earth as well.[92]Shocked that the girl wanted to end her own life, the three heroes were unsure how to go about things when Kelly helped the Super-Skrull escape by using her powers. Kl'rt decided to go against orders and instead of killing Kelly, decided to bring her back to Skrell, intending to convince Intelligentsia. When the trio came after them again, Kelly used her powers once again to help them escape to Earth.[93]Once on Skrell, Kl'rt was surrounded by troops with orders to kill him, but he convinced Intelligentsia to hear him out. While trying to explain the girl's military use, Captain Marvel, Moondragon and the Surfer arrived and another battle rang out. During the fight, Marvel switched places with his partner Rick Jones who convinced the girl that she could stop everything if she willed it that her powers never existed. Succeeding in doing so, the girl disappeared and the heroes departed.[3]\nOriginal form of Lon Zelig[94]\nGiving up on redeeming himself, the Super-Skrull returned to Earth where he took over the identity of special effects master Lon Zelig and lived in seeming anonymity. Eventually he ended up working for Hawk Productions to work on a film for his old foe the Human Torch. When Johnny Storm arrived for the first meeting, Skrull assassins arrived disguised as the Fantastic Four seeking to eliminate Kl'rt for crimes against the empire. Kl'rt fled, but eventually he revealed himself to the Torch and that his \"teammates\" were really Skrull spies that were hunting him, after he killed them all and left the scene.[94]The Torch never betrayed Kl'rt's double identity, and he continued operating as Zelig for a time.[95]However he was tracked down by both thePuppet Masterand theMad Thinkerwho were gathering an army of Fantastic Four villains to attack their mutual foes. The Super-Skrull was in attendance, but after the Puppet Master's recruitment speech, he and the rest of the attendees left, unaware that this was all part of an elaborate plot to collect their DNA. This DNA eventually fell into the hands of the Fantastic Four who began using it to track down their foes, thanks to falsified calculations that led Mr. Fantastic to believe they would die in two years if they did not stop all their foes.\nSecond form of Lon Zelig[95]\nHowever, this DNA tracker was not needed to hunt down the Super-Skrull, who had grown bored with Earth and sought to return home. He got in touch with a SHIELD agent that was willing to smuggle him equipment, but it proved to be insufficient for his uses. Taking a gamble, he disguised himself asFranklin Richards, the son of Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman to infiltrate the Baxter Building and steal the equipment he needed. However, Mr. Fantastic saw through the disguise and thinking her son was in danger the Invisible Woman savagely attacked Kl'rt.[95]By the time the Fantastic Four learned that Franklin was okay, and that they had forgotten to pick him up from school, Sue stopped her assault but by that point the Super-Skrull was already knocked out. He was then placed in stasis aboard theS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrierwith other captured Fantastic Four villains while Reed worked on building a newVaultprison in theNegative Zone.[97]\nWhen the prison was complete, Kl'rt and the other captured villains were placed within. However, the Mad Thinker's plan came to fruition with a means to get into the Negative Zone with his Negative Zone allyThreskathey breached the prison and staged a jailbreak to cover their flight into the Negative Zone.[98]The Super-Skrull and the others attempted to escape but they were defeated and returned to their cells by the Fantastic Four and their allies theShe-HulkandHercules. The Mad Thinker's plot was eventually realized and he too was later captured as well.[99]\nThe Super-Skrull capturing Hulkling\nThe Super-Skrull eventually broke out of the Vault in the Negative Zone, although the circumstances are unrevealed.[100]Learning that the long dead Princess Anelle had a child with his old foe, the original Captain Marvel, and that the Skrull empire was seeking out this heir -- named Dorrek VIII -- the Super-Skrull made it his mission to find the boy first. Dorrek VIII turned out to beTeddy Altman, also known as the Hulkling, who was a member of the recently formedYoung Avengersteam. The Young Avengers managed to fight off the Super-Skrull when he attempted to abduct Teddy. They fled to their teammateWiccan's family home. There they were shocked to find Teddy's adoptive mother and secret Skrull,Mary-Jo Altman, suddenly the Super-Skrull arrived and attacked, killing Mary-Jo, revealing the truth he was so quick to deny-- that he was indeed a Skrull. In the confusion, the Super-Skrull managed to escape with the Hulkling as his prisoner.[16]Aboard his ship, the Super-Skrull told Teddy his origins and how he had to return to the Skrull Empire as their ruler in order to reunify his people. When Teddy continued to refuse to go, Kl'rt attempted to use his hypnotic powers when the Young Avengers suddenly attacked. With Kl'rt subdued, he went on to explain that Teddy's biological parents were dead, and before he could explain things further an army of Kree soldiers appeared on the scene seeking to force Teddy into the Kree military as all youth of the Kree empire are required.[101]\nWhen Teddy refused to join the Kree another battle erupted, but the Young Avengers managed to flee with the injured Super-Skrull. As they fled, Kl'rt noticed a resemblance between Wiccan and their newest memberSpeedand wondered if they were the children of the Avengers' Scarlet Witch and the Vision. Their flight was interrupted when both Kree and Skrull forces came for Teddy and theNew Avengersarrived on the scene as well, starting a three way battle over Teddy's fate.[5]Amidst the chaos, the Super-Skrull came to realize that Hulkling's place was truly on Earth. The pair then conspired a way to end the fighting so that Teddy could remain on Earth. The fight was stopped when the Super-Skrull disguised himself as Hulkling and agreed to spend half of the year in the Kree and Skrull empires and decide which side he preferred to be on. With the decision agreed upon the Kree and Skrulls left with the Super-Skrull disguised as Hulkling.[9]\nHowever the Super-Skrull's ruse would never come to fruition as shortly after his return, the Negative Zone rulerAnnihiluslaunched hisAnnihilation Waveupon the Andromeda Galaxy. Spying on Kree Star-Base Yon-Rogg, the Super-Skrull learned that the Skrull empire was the first to be attacked by Annihilus and his forces.[102]Kl'rt returned to his home galaxy and attempted to defend the planet Aks'Lo from attack. The warriors stationed there were no match for the Annihilation Wave, and the Super-Skrull was the sole survivor, just barely escaping theHarvester of Sorrowas it consumed the entire planet. Hoping to stop the Annihilation Wave before it could reach Z'aragz'na, Kl'rt went toWarlord S'Bakto attempt to rally troops to fight back against the Annihilation Wave, but she refused to sacrifice her men, hoping to win the power struggle over control of the Skrull Empire. Furious, Kl'rt struck her and was ordered to death and was forced to fight his own people while fleeing. Salvation came when he was rescued by a young mechanic namedR'Kinwhose father fought alongside Kl'rt years earlier during the Battle of Harkoon. The boy asked to join Kl'rt on his quest to save the empire. At first thinking the boy to be a trap, Kl'rt agreed to take him on. Seeking to rally an army of those in the Negative Zone who might fight against their ruler, Kl'rt and R'Kin travelled to Earth where they convinced Kl'rt's old foe Reed Richards to send them into the Negative Zone.[17]\nSuper-Skrull's army\nThe Super-Skrull cut a swath of destruction across the Negative Zone searching for a means to destroy the Harvester of Sorrows, torturing the minions of Annihilus and then slaughtering them after they gave him the information he sought. Horrific acts that changed R'Kin's opinion of his idol. They were drawn to the Nexus of Igoa and the UX-73 prison to findHawalthe inventor of the Harvester who now ran the prison. Kl'rt stormed the prison and destroyed its defenses and then beat Hawal senseless, forcing him to agree to create a virus to destroy the Harvester. When the prisoners attempted to get revenge against their ruler, Kl'rt beat them into submission and convinced them into joining his cause. The prisoners agreed, and his most loyal followers was the sentient machine known asPraxagoraand the multiplyingPreak.[103]As he trained his people, Kl'rt rejected a romantic advance from Praxagora. When R'Kin finally completed a portal back to the positive matter universe, the Super-Skrull led his army of prisoners against the Annihilation Wave and the Harvester of Sorrows. R'Kin convinced Kl'rt to let him fire the missile containing the virus, but in the end R'Kin betrayed the Super-Skrull and his army to the Annihilation Wave and Kl'rt, Praxagora, and Preak were all captured. Kl'rt then watched helplessly as the Harvester of Sorrows consumed Z'aragz'na, killing his son and all on the planet.[23]\nKl'rt then used his hypnotic powers to force R'Kin to free them. With enemy forces at the door, Preak provided a diversion while Kl'rt and Praxagora fled. Kl'rt tracked down R'Kin to the shuttle bay. Learning that the boy betrayed them because he was changed by Kl'rt's ruthlessness, he offered the Super-Skrull a chance to escape. Instead Kl'rt cut off R'Kin's limbs and cauterized the stumps, leaving him quadriplegic and trapped aboard the ship. Kl'rt then joined Praxagora in the bowels of the Harvester where she planned to unleash her destructive energy core. Kl'rt refused to leave her, using his Torch powers to absorb the heat. The two gave in to their emotions and embraced as the Harvester of Souls was destroyed around them. Praxagora survived the blast, but Kl'rt was seemingly killed in the blast.[104]Praxagora brought the seemingly dead body of Kl'rt to the world ofDaedalus 5where resistance forces led byNovawere fighting a losing battle against the Annihilation Wave. Her arrival preceded the arrival of the elite guards of Annihilus known as theCenturionsattacked the planet.[105]Prax brought Kl'rt's inert body to the medical bay, but soon the battle was on top of them. During the battle, Kl'rt revived but did not join the battle as the heroes were pulling back. When exiled Kree soldier Ronan the Accuser decided to break off from the resistance to retake control of the Kree empire from the House of Fiyero to boost their ranks, the Super-Skrull and Praxagora agreed to join him on his mission.[106]When they arrived on the Kree capital world ofHalathey clashed with Kree forces fighting their way into the House of Fiyero where they caught the business men that consisted of Fiyero making a deal with the Centurions. The trio defeated the Centurions and their leaderRavenous. With their foes defeated, Ronan slew the House of Fiyero and took command of the Kree empire.[107]Super-Skrull was busy on Hala while Nova and his allies slew Annihilus and defeated his Annihilation Wave. In the aftermath of the battle concessions were made that allowed the survivors of the Annihilation Wave to take control of various conquered Kree worlds including the Kree homeworld ofKree-Lar.[108]\nWith relative peace re-established in the Andromeda System, Ronan's first act was to establish a new security net for the Kree Empire. However this system was compromised by the technorganicPhalanx, then under the command of the Earth built robotUltron. They took control of the Kree world of Hala, built a Babel Spire and assimilated much of the population, including high ranking members of society which were dubbed the \"Selects\". This included Ronan and his allies Praxagora and Kl'rt.[109]However while Ronan accepted assimilation, Kl'rt and Prax fought against it and were soon joined by another prisoner of the Phalanx, a man known only asWraith, who had the power to not only resist the Phalanx'sTransmode Virusbut to also expel it by summoning Exolon Plasmoids that could force the infection to abate.[15]\nInfected with the Transmode Virus\nWhen the Phalanx attempted to convert Wraith he fought back, and during the struggle he accessed the computers and reversed the assimilation process on Kl'rt and Prax allowing them to break free from Phalanx control. Kl'rt and Prax then fled with Wraith to the ship run by Kree resistance fighterRa-Vennand joined their cause to free the Kree empire from Phalanx control.[110]Attacking the world of Rei-Vaj they captured a Phalanx scientist and probed his mind to learn that the Phalanx fleet was passing through Kirvati Pass. They launched an attack and while Kl'rt and Prax battled Kree forces, Wraith went to destroy the Supreme Intelligence which was under the control of the Phalanx. He was attacked by Ronan, but the battle ended when Wraith used his powers to purge the Phalanx from Ronan's system freeing them from his control. Ronan then joined their cause to stop the Phalanx infestation of the Kree galaxy.[111]Seeking allies they headed to the ceded portion of the Kree galaxy to seek the assistance of their old foes the Annihilation Wave. As they approached the planet Kree-Lar their ship was shot down.[112]Surviving planet fall, the gathered resistance witnessed as the Phalanx and Annihilation Wave forces clashed. During a lull in the fighting Ronan convinced the hive to allow them a peaceful audience with Ravenous.[113]However their wish for an alliance was all a ruse, while Kl'rt and the others subdued Ravenous and used him as a hostage to keep his forces at bat, Ronan access a secret room in the Kree-Lar throne room, his real objective all along.[114]Below was an army of Sentry robots that were separate from the main War-Net, keeping them uninfected by the Phalanx. Having Wraith coat them in his Exolon Plasmoids to protect them from the Transmode Virus, Ronan intended to use them to annihilate Hala.[115]However upon their arrival in Hala space, Ultron took control of Prax and knocked out Wraith leaving the Sentry army vulnerable to Phalanx infection. He then set Prax to explode, however Kl'rt saved the others with an invisible force-field. Ultron then made his final push to crush the resistance, but he was seemingly destroyed by a coalition of heroes which included Nova,Quasar, theTechnarchknown asWarlock,Star-Lord, andAdam Warlock, saving the Kree galaxy.[116]\nKl'rt eventually learned that his people were planning aninvasionof Earth and sought to get there himself as he learned his daughter had been tracked there as well. Joining a group of enhanced Super-Skrull warriors, he followed them to the planet Dendron where they were to lead a potential opponent to their rule. This turned out to be Kl'rt's old ally Nova. When the other Skrulls attacked Nova, Kl'rt came to his aid slaying them all. He then informed Nova about the danger on Earth and telling Nova that he needed to find his daughter, convinced the Earth born hero to take him with him the Sol system. When they arrived they were attacked by a Skrull fleet in Earth orbit, where it appeared that Kl'rt was actually loyal to the Secret Invasion and turned on Nova.[14]In reality, Kl'rt only made it appeared that he had done so and \"destroyed\" Nova, turning the hero invisible so that he could get to Earth undetected and so he could also go his own way to search for his daughter.[117]\nKl'rt pretends to betray Nova during the Secret Invasion\nHe tracked Jazinda toMinneapoliswhere she and the She-Hulk had the Skrull talisman known asNogoras their prisoner. He attacked them as the flew a Skrull cruiser headed en route to New York where the main battle was happening. She-Hulk leapt out and battled Kl'rt in mid air, leaving Jazinda to struggle with Nogor who broke free the from the neural dampener that kept him in sedation.[18]The pair fought, but ultimately Kl'rt got back to Jazinda and was about to kill her, with Nogor goading him on in the hopes of reclaiming the Sy-Torak gem inside her. However She-Hulk convinced Kl'rt to spare her life as she was all the family he had left. Kl'rt then fought off Nogor and then left, telling She-Hulk to make up a story that Nogor spared her life and that if she went after him again he would not spare her life.[22]Not long after this, Earth's heroes managed to stop the Skrull invasion.[118]\nHaving somehow obtained She-Hulk's phone number, he called her some months later and vowed to get revenge for his previous defeat.[119]Kl'rt was apparently apprehended while still on Earth and was imprisoned on theRafta prison for super-villains. There he was considered as a potential recruit in the beta team of theThunderbolts.[120]Despite his initial selection he was ultimately not chosen for the beta team.[121]\nEscaping through unrevealed circumstances, Kl'rt returned to the Skrull galaxy which now was ruled by various warlords. Becoming a warlord himself, Kl'rt warred for control of the entire empire. That is until theBuilders, powerful alien beings who claimed to be the oldest race in the universe, began destroying races they thought to be imperfect, the remnants of the Skrull galaxy was attacked. This forced Kl'rt and the other Skrull warlords to unite.General Dm'yrsacrificed his life and his soldiers to allow the other warlords to flee the galaxy and seek an audience with theGalactic Councilwhich included representatives of various galaxies including the Negative Zone, as well as the Kree,Spartax,BroodandShi'argalaxies, as well as assistance from the Avengers of Earth. They set up a trap for the Builders in the sector of space known as theCorridor. However the Builders were prepared for such an ambush and launched a counter attack that cost many and forced the council to flee.[122]\nAfter the Council, their warriors, the Avengers, and refugees had fled to the Behemoth Ringworld to regroup and plan a new strategy. They also questioned one of the Builder'sGardenerknown asEx Nihilowho was loyal to their side. However they were betrayed by the Spartax leaderJ'sonwho alerted the Builders to their location and they were attacked again.[123]Kl'rt helped with the evacuation, saving the life of Captain America in the process.[124][125]With this latest attack many races bowed down to the Builders, including the Kree. However Kl'rt and remained steadfast to the cause to stop the Builders and added his forces to the flagging resistance, allowing them some small victories.[124]\nDespite this they began to lose ground once more, and the Galactic Council agreed to go to Hala which was now under the control of the Builders. It was here that Captain America suggested they surrender.[126]They agreed to send down one soldier to deliver the surrender and the thunder god Thor was chosen. When the Builder in charge ordered Thor to toss away his hammer, Thor complied but this was all a plot, as Thor's hammer boomeranged back and slew the Builder, showing the Kree that they could be killed. With the Kree back on their side, the resistance had their numbers boosted once more.[127]However they faced another set back when they attempted to unleash the Annihilation Wave against the Builders and they were able to force the Wave to consume itself. Things turned around whenCaptain Universewas revived and used against the Builders. However they sent an order to theirAlephsto destroy everything.[128]However the combined effort of the resistance crushed the Alephs and reclaimed all the planets they had taken, landing a victory for the Galactic Council. They then learned that Earth was about to fall to Thanos, and Kl'rt and the others agreed to return with the Avengers and help liberate their world.[129]\nEmperor Kl'rt\nAfter taking out a Thanos outpost on Titan they continued on to Earth.[130]Kl'rt joined the battle directly when the heroes arrived and invaded theSWORDspace station which was under the control of Thanos' minion known asBlack Dwarfalong withGladiator, Annihilus, Ronan and the Avengers. Black Dwarf was overpowered and was slain in combat.[131]Ultimately, the Avengers stopped Thanos and saved the Earth. In the aftermath of the battles, Kl'rt was crowned the new emperor of the Skrull Empire and they established a new throneworld on Tarnax II.[132]\nFueled by the desired to remedy the humiliation the Skrull Empire had suffered over the years, Kl'rt began searching for theInfinity Gems. The first gem he located was theTime Gem, hidden beneath the surface of the restored planet ofSakaar.[133][134]Once the gem was in his possession, Kl'rt returned to Tarnax II and had the magicianMt'noxstudy it to amplify its strengths. WhenDoctor Strangevisited Tarnax II as part of a journey to search for magicians in other planets, he discovered that the Time Stone was in the hands of the Skrulls. He determined the stone was too dangerous to be in their hands, and stole it from Kl'rt. Using the gem's power to jump forward in time several times, Doctor Strange created an army of time-displaced duplicates and defeated the Super-Skrull. He and his partnerKannaleft the planet afterwards with the Time Stone.[135]\nWhen the plant-like race named theCotatireemerged with the intention to destroy both the Skrull and Kree empires for millenia-old transgressions, they used the planets of theKral Systemas a testbed for a power-boosting flower called aDeath Blossom.[136]In an attempt to squelch the Cotati, Super-Skrull detonated thePyre, a powerful device that triggered Kral's explosion and burned its planets to a cinder, killing trillions of Krallians.[137]After the plan failed to stop the Cotati, Kl'rt and his Kree counterpart,Tanalth the Pursuer, agreed for both of their empires to form a coalition that became known as theKree/Skrull Alliance. To consolidate this union Hulkling, was appointed as figurehead of the Alliance since he was a Kree/Skrull hybrid and the prophesized unifier, with Super-Skrull and Tanalth still holding most of her power as part of theAlliance's Royal Guard.[138]\nAs part of the Alliance\nThe Alliance attempted to quickly subdue the Cotati on their base of operations in theBlue Area of the Moon, but the Cotati had preventively enlisted the protection of the Avengers.[139]Fooled by the Cotati's pacifist pretense, the Avengers and the Fantastic Four interfered with the Alliance's arrival on theMoonlong enough for the Cotati's leader,Quoia, to use a Death Blossom to cripple the Alliance's fleet.[140]The Alliance subsequently worked together with Earth's heroes to stop the Cotati's invasion of Earth. After Hulkling refused to trigger the Pyre on Earth'sSun,[137]he was secretly abducted and impersonated by his grandmotherR'Klll, who had been posing as Tanalth all along,[141]and she triggered the Pyre as a show of power for Hulkling and the Alliance. When the real Hulkling was liberated by his husband, Wiccan, and he confronted R'Klll with his allies, she rallied the Royal Guard, including Super-Skrull, against him.[142]Shortly after R'Klll was exposed as an impostor, she was defeated by Hulkling, who stepped up as the true king of the Alliance and no longer a figurehead. Following the defeat of the Cotati, Hulkling decided to punish Kl'rt both for killing his adoptive mother, Mary-Jo Altman, and for the massacre of the Kral System, demoting him to a diplomatic posting so that he would spend the rest of his life avoiding senseless killing to make up for the blood in his hands.[21]\nThe Super-Skrull's powers were altered slightly by the magical influences of Master Khan while he was posing as Bobby Wright/Captain Hero, either as a result of the mystical tampering of Master Khan or imposed by the implanted memories that made the Bobby Wright hoax complete.[51]\nUltimately, when Master Khan's deception was complete and Kl'rt was banished back to hyper-space he regained his normal abilities and the additional ones provided to him by Master Khan disappeared.[56][59]\nWhile posing as Daniel Rand, Kl'rt mimicked the Iron Fist Punch that is Iron Fist's trademark move through a creative manipulation of his Human Torch and Thing powers to simulate the necessary effect.[8]"

Some months later, Loki became involved in a war betweenAsgardiaandHeven, fighting theAngelsonEarth'sMoonalongsideOdin, and the Earth heroes who had been present there already. According to Loki's testimony, he was responsible for solving that particular dilemma. WhenThorwas inverted, Loki travelled toLas Vegasto reclaim him, using his command of magic to keep his brother out of trouble. As a result of this deed, Loki was later sent to investigate the mystery ofthe new Thor. During this investigation, Loki and the new Thor came to blows.\nLoki confronted by Thor after killing the Earth\nCenturies later, after facing and defeating theUltronSingularity, Loki's debt was paid, and he no longer had to work for the All-Mother. However, even though he had changed to a better man, he was still remembered as the God of Lies. Within ten years, this fact, and Loki's simmering anger caused him to go back to his old ways and become evil once again, starting with attacking Thor as they talked. More years into the future, and as the result of one of his most evil plans, Loki annihilated the Earth and caused the eradication of humankind. Thor confronted his brother, who used an army of undead heroes to attack Thor but failed. Realizing that the suffering he caused to Thor wasn't enough, Loki decided he wanted to win. He travelled back in time and used his magic form to corrupta younger version of Thor.[9]King Loki's form was captured byhis younger selfafter using the swordGramto free Thor from the corruption, as commanded by the All-Mother. The jar possessing the corrupting force, unbeknown to him that it was his future self, was delivered by Loki to the All-Mother.\nOnce he revealed himself to the All-Mother,[10]he told them about the future he came from, one in which Asgard reigned over the rest of the realms with Thor on the throne, as a consequence of Loki being evil. King Loki started working with the All-Mother to ensure this future came to pass, which included ensuring the young Loki followed his path as a villain. He allied himself with the All-Mother in their plan to bring back to Asgardia every Asgardian who was walking on Earth. When his past self infiltrated Asgardia in order to freeSigurdand discover the All-Mother's secrets, he found himself confronted by the future Loki. King Loki revealed his nature as the future self of the God of Mischief, and his purpose to make his own path and Asgard's happen. Infuriated, Loki quit working for the All-Mother as they desired to embrace the chains of destiny. When he arrived at his apartment, King Loki appeared in the mirror of his bathroom, claiming that bad times were to come.[5]\nKing Loki spied on his younger counterpart, and even attempted to change the course of history through manipulations, like allowingAngelareturn toHevenearlier than she did in his timeline, in an attempt to make her kill Thor, or make Thor kill her. However, his plan failed once the younger Loki freed Odin from his self-exile inAsgard.[11]King Loki briefly returned to his future whenDoctor Doomvisited it, in an attempt to see what was in store for his nationLatveria. Upon finding King Loki in a devastated land where Latveria would've been, Doom was convinced he had to destroy the Loki from the present, an action King Loki expected would help his younger self deviate back to villainy.[12]\nWhen it was revealed the truth that Loki had killed the soul ofa better version of himand was inhabiting his body,[13]King Loki escaped from his dungeon in Asgardia and visited his younger self's house, where King Loki strapped the younger Loki to a chair in order to reveal to him his own story.[14]After bringing to light his motives, King Loki sent his younger self's mind to the very same chamber where theKid Lokihad first encountered him, in order to make him embrace his nature as a villain or perish. Loki chose a third path, and embraced a new nature, as the God of Stories. In the physical world, Loki's body set aflame and disappeared, to King Loki's surprise.[15]\nForgiven and accepted\nWith the finalincursionon the horizon, King Loki joined forces withHelaandTyrto unleashJormungandand destroy the Earth in an attempt to save the universe, which included destroyingAsgardia.[16]Even thoughJormungandwas killed when Freiya sacrificed herself to stop it, more enemies of Asgard took the opportunity to strike.[17]However, King Loki fled the battle as soon as his past self arrived to stop him.[18]\nWhen the universe ended, Loki encountered King Loki defeated and sobbing inthe blank void that was left when everything died. Loki confronted his future self, and made King Loki realize that in the end, he helped Loki change and grow away from being the God of Lies, a path King Loki was not able to change for himself. Both Lokis reconciled, and the younger one contained King Loki's essence inhis scepter.[19]\nLoki the All-Butcher\nFollowing the restoration of theMultiverse, Loki was somehow returned to his timeline and was imprisoned in a pit ofMuspelheimvipers by Thor. Eating the molten serpents to escape,[1]Loki set his sights onAll-Black the Necrosword, which had bonded toEgoafter he killed its former ownerGalactus.[20]In the form of a worm, Loki challenged the Living Planet for the weapon's ownership[21]and ultimately won by whispering words of madness into Ego's ear for nearly a century. Bonding to the primordial symbiote and dubbing himself Loki the All-Butcher,[7]he killed Ego to test his new power before setting off to kill Thor and destroy everything.[22]\nLoki inside the Sun\nLoki has the same powers and attributes to that of hisEarth-616counterpart, but thanks to centuries of practice, he has become more powerful due to his greater age and experience. He was able to massacre the entire population of Earth on his own.\nSorcery:Thanks to centuries of practice and dabbling in the \"darkest foulest arts\", Loki's sorcery has been restored to his full potential and grant him a variety of abilities:\nMaster Manipulator:Loki is capable of manipulating others into serving his purpose, whether willingly or unwillingly. This is best seen in his orchestration of the creation ofGram.\nAll-Black the Necrosword:After bonding with the Necrosword, Loki's natural physical abilities were enhanced, and he also gained other powers from the Necrosword. With it, he was capable of slaughteringEgo the Living Planetwith ease and go toe-to-toe withAll Father Thorin combat.[22]However, Loki resurrectedGorrand relinquished All-Black to him, intending to kill Thor and then die by the God Butcher's hand.[2]"

She suffered a modification in her genes for unknown reasons that granted her squirrel-like abilities, which manifested predominantly in the form of a prehensile tail. When her parents consulted with a doctor, it was determined that Doreen wasn't amutant, even though she believed so for a long time.[1]\nWhen she was ten years old, Doreen discovered she could communicate with squirrels after overhearing one of these rodents in her window. She subsequently saved this squirrel from being chased by a dog, and they became friends. The squirrel, who identified himself asMonkey Joe, encouraged Doreen to use her abilities to help people. Ever since then, Doreen began to fantasize about becoming a super hero, and came up with the alias of the \"Unbeatable Squirrel Girl.\"[8]\nWhen she was fourteen, Doreen ambushedIron Manin aCaliforniaforest nearStark Enterprises Headquartersand hoped to impress the veteran hero, wishing him to take her under his wing as his sidekick. Unimpressed, Iron Man politely declined, when suddenly the duo was attacked byDoctor Doomin a large aircraft. Doom captured and subdued Iron Man, and began to fly out over thePacific Oceanwhere he planned to dispose of Iron Man's body once he killed him. Underestimating her, Doom left Squirrel Girl to her own devices. She devised a plan and used her ability to communicate with squirrels through an open door as the ship passed over the forest. Hundreds of squirrels answered her call and flooded Doom's ship, chewing through the wires, and swamping the evil dictator with their furry bodies. Iron Man was freed, they emerged victoriously, and the two heroes went their separate ways.[5]\nDefeating Doom\nShortly after her fifteenth birthday, Squirrel Girl assisted theHulk, who landed unconscious one day next to her treehouse in the middle of a fight against theAbomination. A concussion had blinded the Hulk, so he had to reluctantly accept Squirrel Girl's help. After swarming Abomination with squirrels, Doreen directed Hulk how to move to land punches and dodge attacks until the villain was knocked out.[8]\nSquirrel Girl later relocated toNew York City. While fighting crime inCentral Park, she saved theGreat Lakes Avengersfrom muggers, for which the GLA recruited her. Alongside her new teammates, Squirrel Girl witnessed the death ofGrasshopperand became very frightened, but was determined not to give up. Thanks to her squirrel army, Squirrel Girl was able to help stopMaelstromfrom destroying the world.[9]\nAfter Squirrel Girl made a fuss to be certain that Monkey Joe was an official member of the team, he was apparently killed by Doctor Doom seeking revenge. In actuality, this was a rejected member of the GLA namedLeather Boyin a variation of Dr. Doom's costume. Squirrel Girl found a new squirrel companion, the only one of her squirrel army who had survived Maelstrom's wrath, whom she namedTippy Toe.[10]\nSquirrel Girl and Tippy Toe managed to individually defeatM.O.D.O.K.,Terrax, andThanos.Uatu, the Earth'sWatcher, was on hand to confirm that the Thanos she defeated was the real thing, and nota clone or copyof any kind.\nAfter M.O.D.O.K.'s defeat,Dum-Dum Duganoffered Squirrel Girl a position atS.H.I.E.L.D., explaining that they'd been watching her for some time and found her to be one of the most effective people ever at defeating powerful supervillains. Squirrel Girl declined the offer, saying she was happy being with the GLA.[11]\nWhile visiting squirrel friends in Central Park, Squirrel Girl came acrossthe Thingfighting withBi-Beast. She told the squirrels to retrieve the smelliest garbage they could find and place it around the combatants, resulting in everyone having to hold their noses. Bi-Beast had to use both hands to hold his noses, leaving himself defenseless and allowing Thing to knock him out.[12]\nDefeating Thanos\nSquirrel Girl and the rest of the newly-renamed Great Lakes Champions, who took the name after winning a poker game, registered under the Superhuman Registration Act the morning the law was enacted. However, mercenary-for-hireDeadpool, assuming the Champions were non-registered, attacked the team at their headquarters (Deadpool sought to ingratiate himself with the government by capturing non-registered heroes). Deadpool was bested in combat by Squirrel Girl; his distraction at her appearance and name contributed to his inability to mount an adequate defense to her attacks.[4]\nDeadpool and the GLA would later team up a few months later to take downA.I.M.agents who had kidnapped a waywardDionysusand fashioned an inebriation ray that made every super hero on the planet (save for Deadpool and the GLI) drunk. After the battle, Deadpool decided to hang around the GLI's new government-funded headquarters, as a \"reserve member\" for a while.[3]\nSquirrel Girl was a huge fan of theNew Warriors, especiallyRobbie \"Speedball\" Baldwin, on whom she had a crush.[13]She learned of Speedball's transformation into the darker hero code-named Penance after Deadpool provided her with a copy ofCivil War: Front Line#10. Squirrel Girl traveled toThunderbolts Mountainto convince Robbie to lighten up and stop being Penance. Frustrated by his current attitude and unwavering determination to remain as Penance, Squirrel Girl traveled toLatveriato use one of Doctor Doom's time machines to travel to the past and prevent Speedball from ever becoming Penance. The machine instead transported her into thefuture, where she encountered analternate versionof Speedball (whom she unsuccessfully tried to get to travel back to the past with her), andMister Immortal, who told her she had an important task to perform in the past — namely, kicking Deadpool out of the Great Lakes Initiative's headquarters.[3]\nWhen theSkrullslaunched their invasion on Earth, Squirrel Girl and the GLI confronted their latest recruit, the newGrasshopper, who had revealed himself as a Skrull infiltrator.[14]Some time after the invasion was over, Squirrel Girl and her teammates welcomedGravityto the GLI when he was relocated fromNevadatoWisconsin.[15]\nDoreen protecting Danielle Cage\nSquirrel Girl eventually realized that she was holding back her teammates, who wouldn't join her in fighting supervillains because she was competent enough to beat them on her own. After defeatingFin Fang Foomwhile her teammates remained at their HQs calmly playing poker, she decided to unceremoniously leave the GLI and go solo.[16]She would return toNew York Citynot long after that.[17]\nDoreen was hired to be the nanny ofDanielle Cageand lived in theAvengers Mansionalongside theNew Avengers.[18]She looked after the baby through many events, most notably theSerpent's invasion.[19]WhenLuke Cageleft the team, she followed him andJessica Jones, as she was still the nanny of their child.[20]\nAfter leaving Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, Doreen started living secretly in the attic of the Avengers Mansion until she enrolled in theEmpire State University. During her first day of class, she encountered who would become her best friend and confidante,Nancy Whitehead, and her catMew. Doreen also confrontedKraven the Hunter, and convinced him to give up on his vendetta againstSpider-Man.[21]The first major threat that Doreen averted during her stay at ESU wasGalactus, whom Doreen managed to intercept as he was approaching the Earth. After bonding with Galactus, Doreen found himNutopia XXIV, a moon completely forested with nut-bearing trees, which sated his hunger.[22]\nWhile at ESU, Doreen developed a crush on one of her first few acquaintances at the university,Tomas Lara-Perez,[23]later revealed to be the super hero Chipmunk Hunk, who possessed similar powers to Squirrel Girl's, and fought crime together with his friendKen Shiga, also known asKoi Boi. Both Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boi became close friends of Doreen and her crime-fighting allies.[24]\nDuring her second year at college,[1]Doreen became a member ofSunspot'sNew Avengers,[25]and transitioned into theU.S.Avengerswhen Sunspot began working for S.H.I.E.L.D. and the American intelligence service.[26]Doreen also assisted the supervillainBrain Drainin reforming and becoming a good-doer himself.[1]During her subsequent adventures, Doreen most notably confronted Doctor Doom in the past[27]and stopped the multiplying villainEnigmofrom taking over the United States.[28]For a brief time, Doreen received mentoring and was even gifted a flying suit from entrepreneurMelissa Morbeck, though it turned to be part of an intricate plan of world domination.[29]During a trip to theSavage Land, Doreen teamed-up with Kraven the Hunter to fight a version ofUltron, which cemented him as an ally of Squirrel Girl, and swayed him from the path of villainy.[30]\nDoreen and her allies\nAt some point, Squirrel Girl was able to examineVincent Doonanand study hisDoombottechnology in exchange for hanging out withGwenpool. The two have also teamed-up to rescue Gwen's brother,Teddy Poole, fromMephisto'srealm.[31]Gwenpool later remembered that incident fondly while speaking at Doreen's funeral, which was held after aSkrullhad staged her death.[6]During theWar of the Realms, Doreen was sent on a secret mission byLokito saveNorth Americafrom theFrost Giants.[32]She ran intoRatatoskrand the two worked together,[33]eventually managing to drive away the Frost Giants back toJotunheimby sparking a political revolution against their monarchy.[34]\nSquirrel Powers:Squirrel Girl is amutatewith several traits that are similar to or usually associated with squirrels. Squirrel Girl possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, and reflexes.[39]She possesses the proportional abilities of a squirrel scaled up to human size.[40]"

Its last protector was the King ofAsgard,Thor. Out of nostalgia, he wished for theMidgardof old and was the only one who had interest in the planet until the Devourer of Worlds himself, Galactus, arrived to complete the one thing he never accomplished: to satiate his hunger for Earth.[1]\nAs Galactus began to drill into the planet to absorb its life energy, King Thor and his grand-daughters looked on with a sense of awe as Galactus hadn't been seen in centuries. Thor decided to take on the creature himself against his grand-daughters wishes so he opened up a portal withMjolnirto send them back to Asgard for their safety. As Thor confronted Galactus, he did not heed to Thor's words and told the Thunder God that it was Earth's time to die, and that he may die along with it. Thor immediately attacked Galactus with a mighty blow from his hammer but ended up being counteracted by a powerful blast of thePower Cosmic.[2]\nPower Cosmicvs.Thor-Force\nGalactus gained the upper when he bombarded Thor with a massive dose of his power, causing Thor to be shot into space. Thor then gathered up all of theThor-Forcewithin him and flew back at top speed to strike at Galactus while the latter fired another powerful burst of the Power Cosmic. As they both collided, they ended up cancelling each other's abilities out, but a tiring Thor got hit with a final blast by Galactus which ended in his apparent death, leaving the Devourer to finish off the Earth.[3]With King Thor hurled into outer spacehis three granddaughtersreturned to Earth to fight Galactus using ancient weapons. They held their own for a while until Galactus tired and created a massive explosion.[4]\nWhen he was ready to finally devour Earth and kill the Godesses of Thunder, Galactus was attacked by King Thor, who returned from deep space withAll-Black the Necrosword, and was brutally defeated by him.[5]After their battle, King Thor gave Galactus leave to consumeMarsand while Galactus was devouring it, the black blade, that Galactus believed to be destroyed, manifested itself inside the Devourer of Worlds, turning him into the Butcher of Worlds.[6]\nBeing eaten by Ego\nSome time later, after devouring countless worlds, the Butcher of Worlds was devoured byEgo the Living Planet, who absorbed All-Black the Necrosword into himself after being impaled by it.[7]"

After Shadrak designed the bomb, he managed to escape Gorr by hiding in the one place he never thought to look: the cave where he was defeated by Thor. Meanwhile, Gorr set out to build the doomsday device himself.[3]\nAs he needed the heart of anelder god, one or two moons and some centuries to build the Godbomb,[1]Gorr traveled toChronux, a planet inhabited by theTime Gods, to use thePool of Foreversto travel through thetimestream.[4]\nAfter having secured the heart of a misbegotten stripling elder god, Gorr used the pool once again to travelthousands of years into the future, where he spent the next 900 years slaughtering and enslaving deities in order to build the Godbomb.[5]It took four hundred years for it to be completely built,[6]and upon its near completion, Gorr took the younger version of Thor fromthe pastto the future to witness his crowning accomplishment's fruition.[5]\nThe Godbomb's Core\nThe Pool of Forevers built into its core and fueled by the blood of the thousands of gods slain by Gorr enabled the bomb to send a ripple backward through time, exploding through every second and infecting every god across the timestream with a portion of the All-Black symbiote, which also served as the bomb's detonator.[7]"

What is known is that he was the last survivor of a race which evolved just after theBig Bang. Because the Elders are each the last surviving members of their respective species, they consider each other to be siblings; often referring to each other as brother or sister. The Elders all have extended lifespans gained through a single-minded obsession with various hobbies. In Ord Zyonz's case, that obsession was gardening and horticulture.[1]\nVirtually immortal, the Gardener devoted his life to the creation of natural beauty by sowing the seeds of plants, flowers, and trees upon barren or devastated worlds. The number of worlds he has turned into fertile planet-wide gardens over the eons is countless. He amassed a knowledge of botany second to none and collected billions of different seeds in his travels. Using his advanced cultivation techniques, he could cover a barren Earth-sized planet with lush vegetation in the space of a year.[3]In recent millennia, the Gardener acquired one of theInfinity Gems, then believed a Soul-Gem, an alien artifact that enabled its possessor to manipulate the fabric of time and channel cosmic energy. The Gardener employed it to stimulate the growth of his seeds beyond their normal rate and to traverse space without a starship.[4]\nOne of the first known uses was when the Gardener used his Gem's power to combat the Stranger, another powerful extraterrestrial possessing an Infinity Gem. Believing that he \"corrupted\" the gem by its use as a weapon, the Gardener abandoned it.[4]Later, the Gardener replaced his Gem with the one once worn by the golden Earth-being Adam Warlock which had been buried with his body on Counter-Earth.[5]Warlock's frequent employment of the gem as a weapon did not matter to the Gardener as long as he himself had not used it in that way.\nWhen theHulktraveled to buryJarellaon her home world ofK'ai, he was attacked by rocks, plants and monsters. He defeated them all and then faced the Gardener.[6]The Gardener locked the Hulk with branches and changed his persona to Bruce Banner. The Gardener left ordering his beast to attack theK'aitians. Despite the Gardener's formidable power, Hulk defeated him and grabbed the gem from the Gardener's forehead. Hulk threw the gem into the planet's core, turning Jarella's world into a garden once more.[7]\nUpon being contacted by the other Elders of the Universe, the Gardener agreed to partake in aggressive activities against the alien beingGalactusand then the universe itself in order to recreate reality.[8]The plan was foiled by Galactus' former Herald, Silver Surfer, and his ally, Mantis and the Gardener was converted to energy and consumed by Galactus along with the other four Elders[9], yet they were later forced out of Galactus byMaster OrderandLord Chaoswho also gave them five of theInfinity Gems, with one going to each of the Elders.[10]\nThe Gem in possession of the Gardener was revealed to be theTime Gem, but he held it for a time unaware of its true powers and simply using it to cultivate his garden. This was untilThanosof Titan came to bargain for it. The Gardener refused to simply surrender his gem. He bound Thanos in vines, but he broke free and then accelerated the Time Gem using thePower Gem, amplifying the Gardener's plant growing powers causing vines and branches to grow from his body and trapping it in place, which allowed Thanos to simply take the stone.[11]\nLater, when the realContemplatororganized theDeadpool Corpsto oppose a cosmic threat: theAwareness, the Gardener assisted theChampionin testing their mettle.[12]After being rescued by the Gardener, the Champion tracked downDeadpoolat a bar and began to fight, but was eventually convinced to join the team under the name Championpool.[13]He was soon tricked into going to fight on another deserted planet, only to find that there was no warriors to fight and his rocket cycle is without fuel, leaving him stranded.[14]\nThe Gardener driven mad\nThe Gardener took part in a contest of champions between theElders of the Universeto decide who would keep theIso-8that was now abundant after the rebirth of the Multiverse, his champions lost and he was eliminated from the contest.[15]Not long afterwards, the Gardener was approached byLokito inquire him about the location of theSoul Stone. Even though the Gardener didn't know its location, Loki poisoned him and drove him mad, making him become paranoid for the desecration of his work by the hand of the advanced societies of the cosmos.[16]"

Ultimate Thor's partner,Beta Ray Thor, was fatally injured in theKingdom of Manhattanby an unknown enemy right after getting a tip on the identity of the woman fromLoki, but he managed to tell her name to Thorlief in his death bed:Jane Foster.[2]\nAfter mourning for their fallen brother, the Thor Corps proceeded to comb through Battleworld for any suspects, any person capable of killing a Thor. Ultimate Thor investigated a Jane Foster from theKingdom of Manhattan, and found her possessions had been taken by an ex-member of the Thor Corps known asThor the Unworthy. Ultimate Thor was unable to get information from Thor the Unworthy as he was called by his brother after finding a new victim, a hammer salesman namedDonald Blake. Before the investigation could begin, Ultimate Thor pinned down Loki, who was found roaming the crime scene.[3]\nDuring the interrogation, Loki claimed to not have murdered the Jane Fosters or Donald Blakes. Loki stated he has simply moved the bodies so they could be left for the Thor Corps to find. Ultimate Thor later followed Loki's directions to the place where a mass grave for Jane Fosters and Donald Blakes was found, theDeadlands. When he was investigating the corpses, Thorlief was struck from behind by the Rune Thor, one of his least amicables peers, who admitted to have killed Beta Ray while he left Thorlief beaten at the mercy of the zombies of the Deadlands. However, he was unexpectedly saved by Thor the Unworthy.[4]"

She used to serve in Thanos'Butcher Squadron, an elite team that carried out barbaric acts of murder that Thanos ordered carried out without question.[2]At some point, she marriedCorvus Glaive, another of Thanos' servants.\nOver the coming years, Proxima Midnight rose through the ranks and became a member of Thanos'Black Order, \nproving herself as the greatest warrior, and cruelest general, in Thanos' army. After theAvengershad left theEarthtofighttheBuilders, one of thefactionsin theincursions, Thanos and the Black Order targeted Earth as their next planet to raze.[3]Proxima Midnight was dispatched toAtlantisto retrieveNamor'sInfinity Gem.[4]But first she would opt to (literally) make landfall in the heart of New York City after the Avengers' main team went off to battle against theBuildersin space, in order to make way for the decimation of Earth as a tribute to her dark master. Taking a contingent of Thanos's army where she would proceed to lay waste to the city and its denizens, eventually coming into conflict withLuke Cageand the latest incarnation of theMighty Avengers.[5]\nWhile in pitched battle with the motley crew stand in for Earth's protectors, Midnight managed to incapacitate the group's leader,Spectrumby lancing her with a fatal anti-photon charge, crippling her light form, then proceeding to pummel Cage into the ground with force and fury. Assured of her own victory, Proxima would soon find resistance in the local civilian bystanders who kept chanting the words 'Avengers Assemble', when she made a move towards them in an irate rage she was stopped by a roused Cage who fought her to a standstill. Just as Thanos projected towards her location in Times Square, voicing his disappointment in her failings asEbony Mawproceeded with his own particular end game Incensed she gets in one last sucker punch On Luke before departing. Finding Atlantis in rubble and Namor devastated, Proxima deduced that Namor did not have the gem in his possession. She made clear her intentions to kill him and destroy Atlantis to Namor, and offered to spare him and his nation in exchange for the location of the gem. Namor pledged her his and Atlantis' allegiance and told her that she could find the gem inWakanda.[6]\nAfter her fellow Black Order memberBlack Dwarffailed to break Wakanda, Proxima,Corvus Glaiveand Thanos himself departed for Wakanda, defeating its defenders and breaching their city wall. They narrowed down the potential location of the gem to theNecropolis, the secret base of theIlluminati.[7]When Ebony Maw located Thanos' son,Thane, inGreenland, the Black Order departed to said country.[8]Meanwhile, Proxima sentKalderato take care of the newNovaunder Thanos' orders.[9]When she failed her mission, Proxima sent her to the \"Midnight Sphere,\" where she would be tortured as a punishment.[10]\nWhen theAvengersarrived in Greenland in order to defeat Thanos, Proxima Midnight was trapped by Thane in an amber construct along with Thanos, which left them in a state of \"living death.\" The two were then taken to the Necropolis.[11]\nProxima along with Thanos and Corvus, who had regenerated in the amber construct, were freed from their prison by Namor, who had had a falling out with the Illuminati for destroying an Earth during an incursion, for the purpose of saving universes from theincursionsas the Illuminati had resolved to rather die than kill the Earths, and joined hisCabalto destroy an Earth during other incursion and spare both universes.[12]\nEight months after the formation of the Cabal, the Cabal had found some degree of legitimacy on Earth. The world stood by and allowed the Cabal to razeWakanda, and claim the ruins as their base of operations. The Cabal continued to protect the universe by destroying colliding Earths, but Namor had grown weary and disgusted with the Cabal's habit of engaging in wholesale slaughter of the colliding Earth's population, as opposed to simply planting the bomb and leaving.[13]\nNamor, now willing to turn himself in for his crimes, devised a plan with the Illuminati to destroy the Cabal. A new incursion was on the horizon, one in which the incursive world had been ravaged by theSidera Maris. Namor would lead the Cabal to said world, activate the anti-matter injector without their knowledge, and leave them to die with said Earth, preventing them from escaping with the use of an A.I.M. platform capable of creating an impenetrable barrier between the two colliding Earths. As the Cabal engaged the Sidera Maris in combat, Namor set his plan in motion. However, he was betrayed by Black Panther and Black Bolt, who pushed him off the platform into the soon-to-be-destroyed Earth.[14]\nAs the Cabal approached the fallen Namor, who lied about his intentions, they discovered an unusual event was occurring. The Earth they were in was, in addition, in an incursion with another universe at the same time. Unable to return to Earth-616, the Cabal made their way to the second incursion point, and escaped from the doomed planet into the third universe, theUltimate Universe.[15]\nThe Cabal allied themselves with theMaker, and began preparing with him for the eventual end of everything.  Anticipating that the final incursion would take place between their world and the Maker's, they ensuredNick Furywould rally his world to fight theirs, buying them enough time to complete theirlife raft, which would enable them to survive the end of theMultiverse.[16]\nAs the final incursion raged, the Cabal were hard at work putting the finishing touches on their life raft, a device designed to allow them to survive the end of the Multiverse, based on the designs ofReed Richards. During the battle between Earth-1610 and Earth-616, the Maker used hisChildren of Tomorrowto buy additional time for the Cabal to complete their work. They were able to finish their craft before the incursion ended, allowing them to live past the end of everything.[17]\nThe Cabal awaken on Battleworld\nEight years after the end of the Multiverse, the Cabal's life raft was unearthed onBattleworld, a patchwork planet created from the remains of several universes byDoctor Doom. As they emerged, they killed aThor, one of the peacekeepers of Battleworld, and learned the name of the world they were on from a local.[18]\nThe Cabal began wandering the wasteland ofUtopoliswhere they had awoken, making camp to rest and plot a course. While resting, they were attacked by an army ofThorswho had come to bring them to justice. The Cabal were more than capable of holding their own against the Thors; however, promptingSheriff Strangeto intervene, along with the surviving heroes of Earth-616 who had escaped the end of the Multiverse in their own life raft. The heroes and the Cabal clashed, and when God Emperor Doom himself arrived, Stephen used magic to disperse all those present and scatter them around Battleworld.[19]Several weeks later, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive were found byApocalypseinhis domain. They were contained and brought to Castle Doom, where they were kept in stasis tubes and had their minds probed for information about them and the other survivors.[20]\nProxima was returned to Earth-616 when the Multiverse was restored to its proper state byMister Fantasticafter Rabum Alal was defeated.[21]She served as the tip of her husband's spear inhis Black Order,[22]but returned to work for Thanos after he killed Corvus.[23]When a mysterious cloaked figure wanted to curry favor with Thanos by bring him an alternate reality Mjolnir as a tribute,[24]she, the cloaked figure, andBlack Swansnuck aboard the ship of theCollector, who was in possession of the Mjolnir, to steal the hammer from him. The villains unexpectedly encounteredThor(who was going by the name of Odinson) andBeta Ray Bill[25]who had been captured by the Collector after they attempted to get back the City of Asgard and take the hammer from the Collector.[24]\nThor had already knocked out Bill after undergoing the Warrior's Madness. Thor himself was then knocked out by Proxima and Black Swan so they could take Bill's hammerStormbreaker. The cloaked figure, however, told them that Stormbreaker wasn't their target. So, Proxima and her companions continued their search of the Collector's ship and eventually found the City of Asgard where the hammer was located. Proxima and her companions attacked the Collector but were repulsed by an energy blast from the Collector.[25]\nThen Thor and his allies entered the fray leading to a three-way fight between the Black Order, Collector's side, and Thor's side.[26]Proxima and her companions were finally knocked out when Thor unleashed a blast of energy from the hammer. Thor then left with his allies, the hammer, and Asgard using the hammer's teleportation power. Proxima was forced to return to a now free Thanos empty-handed. When Thanos threatened the cloaked figure for failing to bring him a tribute, the figure decided to prove herself to Thanos by brutally killing Proxima with her own spear before revealing herself as the Asgardian death godHela.[27]\nProxima Midnight was returned to life by theChallengeras part of his plan to reassemble the Black Order and have it fight theGrandmaster'sLethal Legion.[28]The two teams were teleported to Earth in order to survey it, since the planet had been chosen as battleground. A fight broke between the competing teams, but was interrupted by the gamemasters since the contest was yet to begin. In preparation for the first round, the Black Order attacked theAvengers Mansionby surprise and blew it up.[29]The heroes managed to survive, however, having been teleported away from danger at the last second byVoyager.\nFor the first round, the teams were divided in half to fight for each of the twoPyramoidsdeployed by the Grandmaster and the Challenger. Proxima was among the members of her team fighting in Cusco,Peru, where they confronted one of the halves of the Lethal Legion.[30]A group of Avengers interrupted the fight,[31]with the round ending after theHuman Torchtouched the Pyramoid. Meanwhile, the other Pyramoid had been claimed byBlack Dwarf, scoring one point for the Black Order. The two people that touched the Pyramoids were teleported to the Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room, though in a manner it seemed like they had been disintegrated.[32]\nNigh-Invulnerability:[6]Proxima Midnight was shown to be able to fall from space through Earth's atmosphere with no discomfort during landing and even while burning through planetary re-entry,[38]she has also survived a confrontingLuke Cagereceiving only minor wounds.[39]\nSuperhuman Strength:[6]Proxima Midnight has incredible levels of physical strength, she has easily madeLuke Cagebleed and even cracked some of his ribs during their confrontation.[39]\nSuperhuman Speed[6]\nSpear:Proxima wielded a spear forged for her by Thanos. It was created from a sun trapped in distorted space-time, acting and operating as a star, supernova, and black hole at once. Once thrown, it may become a lance of multi-arcing energy carrying the tremendous mass of its template sake. Proxima also suggested that she was able to exert control over its density. An arm which never misses its mark, it acts as a lethal projectile and may release a form of energy netting which turns jet black after ensnaring, weighing down, and effectively immobilizing a target. It must first hit a target to cause this effect. The lance also carries an incredibly lethal toxin with it upon contact, which can kill about anything be it flesh or evenliving energywithin moments.[5]The appellation was powerful enough to match and bind the immense strength of the Hulk, as well as revert him back into Bruce Banner once upon drawing it out of him.[11]"

The radiation mutated him and his friends, turning him into a super-strong rock like monster with a \"Heart of Gold\".[39]Together they became theFantastic Four, a team of adventurers who exploredspace,time, andalternate dimensionsand saved the world along the way from science-based threats.[40]\nBenjamin J. Grimm was born onYancy StreetonManhattan's Lower East Side, where he grew up in poverty. His father, an alcoholic, was unable to hold a job. Much of the family's income came from Grimm's older brother,Daniel, who obtained funds illegally as leader of theYancy Street Gang. Grimm, who idolized his brother, became embittered against the world when Daniel was killed in a battle between rival gangs. Grimm was only eight years old at the time. Within ten years, he had succeeded his brother as leader of the Yancy Street Gang. After his parents died, Grimm was taken in by his UncleJake, who had risen from poverty to become a successful physician. At first, Grimm resisted his new guardians' kindness toward him. But eventually, he came to return their love. He left his life with the Yancy Street Gang behind, entered high school, and became a football star there. While he was a senior at Stuyvesant High School, Ben received a football scholarship toState UniversityinHegeman,New York. On the football field, Ben received the nickname \"Grimm Reaper.\"[17]\nGrimm's freshman year roommate was the brilliant science studentReed Richards, who became his closest friend. During their first meeting, Richards confided in Grimm his intention someday to build a starship for interstellar travel. Grimm jokingly promised that he would pilot the starship for Richards if he ever built it.[41]\nUpon graduating, Grimm went into the U.S. Air Force and became a highly skilled fighter pilot,[17]as well as a test pilot and an astronaut. In the meantime, Richards went ahead with his project to build a starship, using both his own fortune and funding from the federal government. On the day that Grimm left the military, Richards came to him to remind him of his promise to pilot the starship.\nBen's early costume\nRichards' project was based inCentral City,California. When the federal government threatened to withdraw its funding from Richards' project, Richards decided to takethe starshipon a test flight himself as soon as possible. Grimm was opposed to the idea, warning that the starship's shielding might prove to be inadequate protection from intense radiation storms. Nevertheless, Grimm was persuaded to serve as the pilot, and Richards' future wifeSue Stormand her teenage brotherJohnnyinsisted on accompanying Richards' as passengers. The four friends stole into the launch facility, entered the starship, and launched it. They intended to travel through hyperspace to another solar system and back. However, when the ship passed through acosmic raystorm, they were met with an unexpected intensity. Since the ship was designed to shield against ordinary levels of radiation, the cabin interior was subject to intense cosmic ray bombardment which irradiated the four passengers and wrought havoc on the ship's controls. Pilot Grimm was forced to abort the flight and return to Earth.\nBen's early lumpy form\nOnce back on Earth, the four passengers discovered that the cosmic radiation had triggered mutagenic changes in their bodies. Grimm was transformed into an orange-colored, thick-skinned, heavily-muscled, and superhumanly strong \"thing.\" Richards convinced the three others that the four of them should use their new powers for the good of humanity as members of a team named theFantastic Four. Richards called himself Mister Fantastic, Susan and Johnny Storm took the names of the Invisible Girl (later Invisible Woman) and the Human Torch, and Grimm, morose over his new grotesque appearance, named himself the Thing.[39]Under Richards' leadership the Fantastic Four has become Earth's most honored team of superhuman adventurers and has saved the world from conquest or destruction many times. Their incorporation heralded the modern age of superheroes.\nThe Fantastic Four were not just Ben's friends, they became his surrogate family, and he was like a beloved uncle to Reed and Sue's children,Franklin(whose middle name is Benjamin, after the Thing) andValeria. He also often assisted his teammate Johnny during the young man's solo adventures.\nBen's iconic, rock-like appearance\nOver the years, the mutations to the Thing's body have continued to progress slowly. The composition of his epidermis changed from an abnormally dense, somewhat-lumpy-but-still-comparatively smooth hide to a flexible, interlocking network of rock-like lumps. His superhuman strength increased considerably over time. Early in Grimm's life as the Thing, he would sometimes revert to his original human form unexpectedly. But neither these changes nor those induced by Richards in his efforts to turn Grimm back to human form ever proved to be permanent. Eventually, Grimm always reverted to his monstrous, superhumanly powerful form. Appalled by his appearance, Grimm was at first filled with anger at his situation, but he eventually became resigned to his fate, although he continued to be disturbed by his appearance and to hope for a means of regaining his human form that would last. Instrumental in helping Grimm to adjust to his life as the Thing was the blind sculptressAlicia Masters, whom he met during the Fantastic Four's confrontation with her step-father, thePuppet Master,[42]and who became his girlfriend.[43]\nAfter a battle with theHulk, where he had been exposed to the Hulk'sGamma radiation, Ben was permanently transformed back into his human form[44]and was replaced in the Fantastic Four byLuke Cage.[45]He returned to the team using an exoskeleton constructed by Reed Richards that emulated his old powers,[46]however, he was soon changed back into the Thing as a punishment byGalactus.[47]\nReed Richards eventually discovered that Grimm had reached a state in which he could transform from his Thing form to human form and back at will. However, Grimm feared that Alicia Masters would only love him as the Thing, for she had not known him before his initial transformation. Hence, Grimm suffered from a subconscious mental block that prevented him from becoming human.\nThe relationship between Grimm and Masters was suffering from strains when Grimm was transported to the distant \"Battleworld\" by the alienBeyonderfor the first of the so-called \"Secret Wars.\" On that planet, Grimm found himself able to change to human form and back. Concealing his discovery of Grimm's mental block for fear of hurting his feelings, Richards claimed that the nature of the planet itself was somehow responsible for Grimm's ability to transform back and forth. Once the \"secret war\" was over, Grimm remained on the planet for months. Eventually, however, he found himself trapped once again in his monstrous form, unable to change to human form, and he returned to Earth. There, Grimm learned that his teammate Johnny Storm and Alicia Masters had become lovers, and that Reed Richards had concealed the information about his mental block from him. Furious and distraught, Grimm quit the Fantastic Four. He worked for a time as a superhumanly strong wrestler for theUnlimited Class Wrestling Federation, and also participated in missions with theWest Coast Avengers.\nGrimm was about to accept membership in the West Coast Avengers when he began to undergo further mutation, becoming, at least in his own mind, still more grotesque. Greatly disturbed, Grimm journeyed toMonster Isle, where he had first encountered his foe, theMole Man. Now, however, the Mole Man befriended the Thing and welcomed him into the society he had organized in his underground realm, composed of physically ugly people like himself who had believed themselves to be outcasts in the surface world. Grimm agreed to help the Mole Man in his attempt to use an earth shifting machine to raise a small continent in the Pacific Ocean to serve as a homeland for the Mole Man's society. While Grimm lived in the Mole Man's realm, his most recent mutations went into remission, leaving him looking little different than before these recent mutations had begun.\nThe three other original members of the Fantastic Four found the Thing in the Mole Man's realm, where Reed Richards realized that by raising a continent in the Pacific, the Mole Man would trigger earthquakes that would destroy California. The Thing joined Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, and the Human Torch in destroying the Mole Man's earth-shifting machine, and rejoined the Fantastic Four.\nBen as the leader of the FF\nWhen Reed and Sue retired from active Fantastic Four duty to focus on raising their son, they left Ben in charge. He recruitedCrystalandMs. Marvel (Sharon Ventura)to replace them and served capably as team leader, starting a romance with Sharon that deepened after new cosmic radiation exposure further mutated them both, turning Sharon into a sort of \"She-Thing\" and Ben into an even stronger, more hideous spiky-hided Thing. Their romance continued through several more changes of form (with Ben eventually settling back into his classic Thing form), even after Reed and Sue rejoined the group; but they were estranged after Sharon acceptedDoctor Doom's aid in regaining human form. Ben has not yet had a serious relationship since his split with Sharon, though he has flirted with Reed's old friendAlyssa Moyand briefly datedDamage ControlexecutiveKathleen O'Meara. When the Alicia who had eventually married Johnny was revealed to be the shape-shiftingSkrullsspyLyja, the Fantastic Four found and rescued the real Alicia, but she and Ben remained only good friends.\nBen maintained a bizarre enmity with the Yancy Street Gang, his former peers having passed down their resentment of Grimm to the next generation of Yancy punks. Over the years, the gang perpetrated a seemingly endless series of practical jokes, verbal abuse and petty assaults on Grimm, though many of the practical jokes credited to the Yancy crowd were actually played by a sneaky Johnny Storm. At the same time, the Yancy Streeters took a perverse pride in their distinguished alumnus and were known to come to Ben's aid on occasion. They seemed to think only they had the right to abuse him. Though estranged from the gang, Ben remained friendly with some of his childhood chums from Yancy Street, includingCholly(now owner of the Yancy Street Bar and Grill), helicopter pilotHopper Hertneckyand old high school buddy\"Slugger\" Sokolowski. Ben also kept in touch with his uncle Jake, who married a new wife - the much youngerPetunia \"Penny\" Grimm- after Alyce died. Ben took a great liking to Petunia, whom he often jokingly described as a little old lady until the Fantastic Four actually got to meet the beautiful Mrs. Grimm in person.Alynn Chambersalso renewed her friendship with Ben (though not their romance), seeking his guidance and support after a stroke left her disfigured and partially crippled.[48]\nBen was once killed during a battle with Doctor Doom. However, Reed was certain that Ben could be resurrected. He convinced Sue and Johnny to join him in this quest, which ultimately led them to the gates of Heaven itself using a modified model of Doom's old afterlife machine. Persuaded it was not yet his time, Ben agreed to return to the land of the living with his friends - and the Creator allowed it.\nBen in his Fantastic Four uniform\nThings soon changed for Ben when he became aware the market value of stock that Reed gave him had skyrocketed This rise in value made Ben a multi-millionaire. In light of his newfound wealth, Ben began living the good life. He dated a movie star, made trips with his godson Franklin and even tookLockjawas his pet for some time. It was also during this time that he went to work for a grumpy old grocery-clerk, whom he had known as a youth, on Yancy Street to make amends for destroying the clerk's property. After he had repaid his debt in work (for the damage he done), Ben and the clerk parted ways. Ben was exhausted and took a nap on the bus stop at Yancy Street waiting to go home. During this time, the Yancy Street Gang sprayed his whole body over with graffiti and other filthy things. When Ben woke up, he was reminded why he rarely visited Yancy Street anymore.\nSome time later, the owner of the market where Ben worked talked to the rabbis of the synagogue and asked if Ben had an interest in having his bar mitzvah, because as he had completed 13 years of his second life as the Thing, they made him an exception. Ben accepted and began to study. He invited his friends, including several super heroes such as Avengers, X-Men, Spider-Man, Impossible Man, Defenders, Champions, Great Lakes Avengers / X-Men / Defenders / Champions. for the ceremony and then to celebrate, a poker tournament in its luxury penthouse.\nThe Thing also used his newfound wealth to build a community center in his old neighborhood on Yancy Street, the \"Grimm Youth Center\". Thinking the center was named after the Thing himself, the Yancy Street Gang planned to graffiti the building exterior, but discovered the building was actually named after Daniel Grimm, Ben's deceased older brother and former leader of the gang.[citation needed]\nInitially in the Super HeroCivil War, Ben was a reluctant member ofIron Man's side, until the Thing witnessed a battle on Yancy Street whereCaptain America's forces tried to rescue captured allies held by Iron Man's forces. Old Fantastic Four foes theMad Thinkerand thePuppet Mastertried to escalate the battle, using a mind-controlled Yancy Streeter to deliver a bomb. The young man died and the Thing verbally blasted both sides for not caring about the civilians caught in the conflict.[49]He announced that while he thought the registration was wrong, he was also not going to fight the government and was thus leaving the country for France. While in France he metLes Heroes de Paris(The Heroes of Paris), and perform a few missions with them. He was also proposed a romance byAnaïsbut rejected the offer.[50]\n\"Are you lookin' at me?\"\nBen returned toNew Yorkas both sides of the SHRA battled in the city. Ben was oblivious to either side that got in his way, choosing to protect the civilians from harm.[51]At the conclusion of the war, Reed and Sue Richards decided to “take a break” from the Fantastic Four, leaving an opening on the team. With the Wakanda embassy in New York destroyed, theBlack Pantherand his wifeStormwere invited to stay in theBaxter Buildingand along with the Thing and the Human Torch, they formed a new Fantastic Four.[52]\nDuring theSkrull invasion, the Skrull Lyja, posing as Sue, sent the Baxter Building, with Ben, Johnny, Franklin, and Valeria inside, into the Negative Zone. With the aid of theTinkerer, Ben broke out of the Negative Zone Prison,[53][54]and they were able to return home just after the invasion had ended.[55]\nFollowing the Siege of Asgard, Ben was asked byLuke Cageto become a member of theNew Avengers. Cage assured Ben that he could maintain joint membership with both teams just as Wolverine served as a member of the Avengers and the X-Men at the time.[56]\nAround this time, Ben received a serum from theFuture Foundation, which allowed him to turn back to his human form for one week, once a year.[57]\nAngrir, Breaker of Souls\nWhenSkadireleased theSerpent, he called the Hammers ofthe Worthyto Earth. One of these hammers fell on Yancy Street and transformed the Thing intoAngrir, Breaker of Souls. After destroying Yancy Street,the Future Foundationattempted to free Ben's mind, but he was too far gone and too powerful for them to stop. Later, he noticedSpider-Manswinging to a hospital to help apregnant womanand followed him, hoping to make an example of him to all who opposed the Serpent. Spider-Man convinced Angrir to leave the hospital, even though Spider-Man could have taken him down, but instead, he outsmarted Angrir, though barely surviving the ordeal.Red Hulkthen challenged him, but of the two goliaths, Angrir emerged victoriously and destroyedAvengers Tower.[2]\nEventually, he, alongside the hammer-possessed Hulk, nowNul, engagedThorand was mortally wounded in the fight. The blow was enough to bring him back to his senses and was freed completely from the hammer's influence by Franklin Richards, who broke his promise to not use his powers to save Ben.[58]\nDuring a Kree attack to New York, Ben fought along the Future Foundation and other heroes against the alien army and went to Soho to see if Alicia Master was well. After the return of Johnny Storm,[59]Ben reunited with the rest of the team. Spider-Man informed Johnny of the situation, and in way of marking his comeback he drew the famous \"4\" in fire on the sky. He reunited with the other members of the Future Foundation and used theAnnihilation Wave's ships to fight Kree's ones until the Inhumans asked permission to finish the Kree army on their own.[60]Meanwhile the other heroes on Earth where dealing with the scraps of the battle which could damage the Earth, Reed and Sue summoned Galactus, who completely destroyed the Kree army. That moment, theMad Celestialsappeared to destroy this universe. Although the team tried to use the Hub (a weapon of mass destruction created by the Reeds), they couldn't defeat the Mad Celestials. Then, future versions ofFranklinandValeriaappeared as part ofNathaniel Richards's plan.[61]The Future Franklin used his power to heal Galactus and destroy the Mad Celestials, saving the day.[62]Later, the Baxter Building was easily rebuilt, Mr. Fantastic showed a new secondary headquarters calledFoundationand new costumes were given to the members of the Future Foundation, as part of the reformation of the Fantastic Four.[63]\nAfter learning from the eye of the murderedUatuthat Johnny unintentionally sabotaged an experiment that could have allowed him to become human again,[64]Ben was found having apparently murdered the Puppet Master; the crime was committed in a sealed room that even Reed could barely penetrate with Alicia as the only witness.[65]Although Ben claimed innocence, his depression over recent events and the lack of alternative evidence led to him being incarcerated in the Raft.[66]Although power-dampeners in the Raft restricted his strength to a more manageable level, he was attacked by various other thick-skinned superhumans- including theArmadilloandIronclad- on orders of the current 'boss' of the prison -Sharon Ventura, the She-Thing.[67]However, after confirming that he had been framed, Ben broke out of prison with the aid ofSandman,She-Hulk, andAnt-Man.[68]\nIt was later revealed the Puppet Master found dead was the corpse of the Puppet Master's counterpart from theCounter-Earth, and the real Masters was found alive, having being kidnapped by the person who had framed Ben, theQuiet Man. In the end, Ben was proved innocent.[69]\nGuardians' uniform\nWhen the universe, and the entirety of theMultiverse, came to an end as a consequence of a phenomena known asincursions, Reed Richards was one of the few survivors.[70]Thing was recreated by God-Emperor Doom convinced to sacrifice himself to become one withThe Shield, the defensive wall ofBattleworld, to protect its citizens from the dangers ofNew Xandar,Perfection, and theDeadlands.[71]\nThing remained a part of the Shield for years until he had a talk withThanosfromEarth-616who was being held in the Shield's detention level. Thanos revealed to Thing that Doom had lied to him all along and that Battleworld was simply an artificial creation of Doom's. Thanos claimed that Doom made him become a wall because Doom feared his power. Thing became enraged after learning the truth. He rose from the ground and marched towardDoomstadtto confront Doom while taking a massive portion of the Shield with him.[72][71]\nThing destroyed by Franklin von Doom's Galactus\nWhen the war against Doom arrived on his doorstep ofDoomstadt, Thing joined the brawl and easily destroyed anything in his way.Franklin von Doomopposed him using hisGalactus, and Thing decided to surrender after learning the kid he was fighting was the son of Sue Storm. Galactus showed him no mercy; however, and blew away most of Thing's upper body with a blast of energy.[35]\nReed took omnipotent power from Battleworld's creator Doctor Doom and began to restore the Multiverse together with Sue and most of the Future Foundation.[73]Since he knew Doom would eternally resent him, Reed altered his memories to make him think he was dead, hoping Victor would become a better man if he didn't pursue ultimate power and also believed his greatest rival to be gone. Reed decided to also alter the memories of the Human Torch and The Thing, leaving them behind on Earth-616 with Victor so they could keep him in check.[74]Since Ben and Johnny believed the rest of their family to be dead, the Fantastic Four were disbanded.[75]In the aftermath of the Fantastic Four's end, The Thing joined theGuardians of the Galaxy.[36]\nHis membership, however, didn't last long. The Guardians were called in byCaptain Marvelto help her forces fightIron Man's during thesecond superhuman civil war.[76]In the middle of the ensuing fight between both factions, the Guardian'sshipwas accidentally destroyed.[77]Now stranded on Earth for the time being, the Guardians parted ways due to internal conflict in the team. The Thing was approached byS.H.I.E.L.D.directorMaria Hillto ask him to investigate for her the new antics of Victor von Doom, who had now turned over a new leaf and began to commit heroic acts.[78]\nIn order to help Johnny cope with the loss of their family, Ben convinced him to go on a multiversal journey using theMultisect, claiming that the device could help them find their family.[75]During their journey, Johnny found out that Ben didn't actually believe the rest of their family was alive.[79]The duo eventually returned to their native universe empty-handed.[80]\nShortly after Ben had decided to move on from the loss of his family by proposing to Alicia Masters, he and Johnny were reunited with Reed, Sue and the rest of the Future Foundation after Reed summoned them to help them fight a mysterious powerful being called theGriever at the End of All Thingswho repudiated the Future Foundation's mission of creating new universes, and confronted the team as soon as Franklin was depleted of his ability to create entirely new realities.[81]Together with other alumni of the Fantastic Four, the core team managed to drive away the Griever.[80]When the heroes returned to Earth, Ben and Alicia decided to move their wedding forward,[82]and married days later with a small ceremony.[83]\nBen and Alicia attempted to hold their honeymoon during the one yearly week that Ben reverted to his human form and start a family, but the Puppet Master interrupted it and attacked The Thing with a mind-controlled Hulk.[84]After an arduous battle, Ben managed gather enough strength to defeat the Hulk a few seconds before reverting to normal, breaking his arm in the process. Ben also lost consciousness for the following week, missing his window to spend time with Alicia in his human form.[85]\nNot long afterward, Reed sought to resume the Fantastic Four's original flight whose failure granted them their powers.[86]When the Fantastic Four reached their original destination, the planet Spyre, they faced a group of superpowered protectors named theUnparalleled, who had been imbued with cosmic radiation to face the Fantastic Four. Spyricans had been aware of the team's initial failed attempt to reach their planet and had prepared for a second try.[87]The Fantastic Four initially became at odds with the patriarch of Spyre, theOverseer, after discovering that he had been responsible for the cosmic ray storm that gave them powers during their first flight due to an attempt to scuttle their mission.[88]When he was faced with this revelation, The Thing tried to kill the Overseer, but was stopped by Sue. After making peace with the Spyricans, the Fantastic Four returned to Earth. Ben made amends with Reed since he no longer blamed him for becoming The Thing.[89]\nThe Thing accompanied Sue,She-HulkandMantisin locating the latter's son,Sequoiaas he was leading theCotatiinto exterminating all animal life. However, She-Hulk was revealed to have been infested with a Cotati and proceeded to beat Ben until it was killed.[90]Following the defeat of the Cotati, Ben Alicia were given custody of the alien orphansJo-VennandN'Kallato raise as their own children.[25]\nDuring an invasion of aliens from the Negative Zone on the Baxter Building, Reed decided to teleport the building one year into the future, causing the aliens to be stranded in space since by that Earth along with the solar system would have moved through space. However, Ben and Alicia's adopted children, Jo and Nikki remained inside the Baxter Building alongside Franklin and Valeria, meaning that the kids would be gone for an entire year. Heartbroken by this, Ben became infuriated over Reed's calmness, and coupled with the scorn the public had for the Fantastic Four, the team disbanded.[91]\nGoing on their separate lives, Ben and his wife Alicia decided to travel abroad in order to pass time until their children returned. They came across the town ofCedarin Pennsylvania where they decided to rest for a while. However, they discovered that the town was severely outdated in comparison to the outside, and soon discovered that near the end of the day time reset back to the day prior. The couple was able to find the source inSanfordwho after being dumped by his girlfriend unknowingly turned back time in order to have another chance. Ben and Alicia attempted to talk with Sanford in order to stop the time loop, but failed everytime. That was until, they managed to convince him to move on with his life and find new love. This worked and the town of Cedar was freed from the time loop, returning to its proper time.[92]\nBen, eventually regrouped with his teammates when they were forced to fight a parasitic alien. During the battle, the Four relived the painful moment of the Baxter Building's disappearance, but despite this they were able to overcome the influence and defeat it. From this battle, Ben realized that Reed was also suffering the loss of his children and faked being calm in the first place since this was what it was expected of him. Reconciling with each other, the Fantastic Four was reformed.[91]\nThe Thing is often depicted with a gruff, tough exterior and can appear grim, but is actually very kind-hearted and often well liked among other heroes. Stubborn and sometimes hot tempered, although that often turns out to make him very determined, enthusiastic and brave, rarely, if ever, gives up a fight.\nThe Thing received his powers when cosmic rays bombarded his body. He is extremely strong and durable.Nick Fury's intel classified him as power level 8.[96]He is considered one of the strongest men on Earth,[97]and stronger than almost any living being on Earth.[98]Based on her knowledge back then,Thundraregarded the Thing as the strongest male on the planet,[99]whileKurrgo, before assimilating knowledge about the Hulk, reputed the Thing as the strongest creature on planet Earth.[100]\nPower Cosmic:When Galactus'Antithesisfrom the Negative Zone depowered the devourer of worlds and began spreading his influence over the universe, Galactus imbued the Fantastic Four with the power cosmic in order to defeat his antithesis.[121]\nFantastic Four uniform\nThe Thing's costume, and the rest of his wardrobe, is constructed ofunstable molecules. The Thing's costume has a complete data processing and telemetry system woven into its fabric on a molecular level, making it like a wearable computer. The costume forms a network with the rest of the Fantastic Four, providing a constant, real time uplink of everyone’s physical condition as well as their location and current situation. The costume is capable of displaying data and has touch-pad controls on the gauntlets. Its sensors can track all of the team's uniforms and provide a picture of their immediate vicinity. The costume has an intricate scanner system which can detect things around the wearer, from how many people are in the next room to what dimension or planet they are on.\nFantasti-Flare\nThe Thing normally carries a miniature flare pistol capable of creating a fiery “4\" signal in the sky. Used as a weapon, the incendiary charge will ignite flammable materials.\nUniversal translator\nBen has a universal translator that can decipher and interpret languages, both alien and terrestrial, into the native language of the user.[129]"

It was created byDoctor Doomusing the power of theBeyonders, which he had stolen via theMolecule Man.[3]Doom ruled Battleworld for eight years as \"God Emperor\" until it was destroyed when the Molecule Man gave the power of the Beyonders toReed Richards.[4]\nDoctor Doom, Doctor Strange, and the Molecule Man against the Beyonders\nTheBeyondersfrom outside theMultiversecreated theMolecule Menas a bomb to destroy the Multiverse.Doctor Doom, known to some as \"Rabum Alal,\" began killing these Molecule Men to mitigate the damage,[5]but setting off the Molecule Men early had dire consequences, theincursions,[6]as the result of the contractions in the Multiverse caused by the Molecule Men's deaths.[7]Once Doom realized that killing the Molecule Men was not going to save the Multiverse, he instead started collecting them to build a bomb to be used against the Beyonders. Joined byDoctor Strange, Doom lured the Beyonders out and unleashed the Molecule Men bomb in one final effort to save what was left of the Multiverse. It destroyed the Beyonders and channeled their power into thelast Molecule Man, who gave that power to Doom.[5]\nGod Emperor Doom\nThe Multiverse perished with the final incursion,[8]but with the Beyonders' power, Doctor Doom was capable of creating an entirely new reality from the remnants of incursion points between collapsing worlds; that new reality was Battleworld.[3]Initially, Battleworld was a chaotic place, locked in eternal night and in a constant state of war between the survivors of the salvaged realities. Doom managed to bring order to the world, ordering the remnants of the separate realities into \"domains\" under his command as the God Emperor of Battleworld.[9]Some domains consisted of the remains of multiple realities and were unified due to warfare or mutual agreement. Each domain was ruled by a baron or baroness, appointed with Doom's blessing. The borders of each kingdom were clearly defined, and travel between different domains was discouraged and required special dispensation from the local baron. Unauthorized travel between domains was a crime and would result in intervention by theThor Corps, Battleworld's police force.[2]\nGod Emperor Doom's castle with itsGalactussentry\nOn Battleworld, Doom was worshipped as a deity, though the denizens of some domains appeared to be unaware of his existance.[10]The Right Hand of Doom wasSheriff Strange, who was the Law, commanded the Thor Corps, and focused on maintaining Doom's order; the Left Hand was theFoundation, led by Doom's daughterValeria, focused on discovery and science.[2]Eight years after the creation of Battleworld, its inhabitants no longer had memories of the worlds they lived in before and believed that they had always lived on Battleworld.[11]While Doom largely allowed events on Battleworld to play themselves out, he intervened on occasion to undo certain events and to alter the fates of those affected when it suited him.[9]\nAs long as the resolute laws of Doom were followed, each baron or baroness had complete control over their province. Disputes between domains were resolved in the court ofCastle Doom, before God Emperor Doom himself, with Sheriff Strange acting as prosecutor and judge. Disputes could be resolved amicably or be settled unevenly. One of the sentences for being found guilty was paying restitution, either with gold or territory. The prosecuted could demand a trial of combat against their accuser. If the accuser refused, any charges against the accused must be withdrawn. Doom could also directly decide the fate of whoever he wanted.[2]\nThree domains (consisting of theDeadlands,Perfection, andNew Xandar) were separated from the rest by a giant wall named theShield, simply for the fact that all three contained threats that if unleashed might destroy the other domains.[2]The Shield was guarded by exiles from Battleworld who were sent there as penance for prior crimes. Due to the Shield's importance, attacking or damaging the Shield, even if by accident, would also lead to exile. The worst punishment a criminal could accrue on Battleworld was exile beyond the Shield, leaving them at the mercy of the monsters who roamed there.[12]\nThe head of a giant Celestial as Battleworld's \"moon\"\nBattleworld was one of only three celestial bodies in its universe. At some point after the creation of Battleworld, Doom sentenced the rebelJohnny Stormto be punished but left the penalty to be decided by his sister,Susan. She resolved to lift Johnny into the sky, where he became the Sun. The legend of \"the Man in the Sun\" has inspired people from certain domains to worship Johnny Storm as a deity.[11]Apart from the Sun, there were no other stars.[13]The third celestial body wasKnowhere, considered Battleworld's moon. It was said that Knowhere was aCelestialthat came to Battleworld to claim it, but God Emperor Doom destroyed the Celestial and left its head floating as a reminder of his power.[14]\nBattleworld collapses\nThe destruction of Battleworld was catalyzed by the arrival oftwo groups of survivorsfrom the defunctEarth-616andEarth-1610via theirlife rafts.[11]While the villainousMaximusgathered an army to oppose God Emperor Doom,Mr. Fantasticand theMakerworked together to find Doom's source of power.[9]When Castle Doom was assaulted, Mr. Fantastic and God Emperor Doom engaged in a furious confrontation that ended when theMolecule Mandecided to give Reed the power of the Beyonders. Without it, Doom could no longer hold Battleworld together, and it quickly collapsed.[4]\nThe Multiverse was brought back as theEighth Cosmosby Mr. Fantastic wih the help of the Molecule Man andFranklin Richards.[4]Due to Battleworld's reality having been the epicenter of thismultiversal renewal, it became rich in a substance known asIso-8, a material identified as the byproduct of creation itself.[15]\nThe remnants of Battleworld were discovered by theElders of the Universeof the restored Earth-616 after realizing the multiverse had endured a death and a rebirth. They resolved to fight for the possession of the Iso-8, and decided to use the broken shell of this world as the arena for their Contest of Champions, a competition where several individuals, taken from Battleworld and the reborn multiverse, fought to the death on behalf of each Elder. The highest prize was theISO-Sphere, the concentrated and most powerful form of the Iso-8.[15]\nMaestro rebuilds Battleworld\nThe two last remaining competitors,Baron Maestroof Battleworld'sDystopiaand thePunisherof2099 A.D.began working together against the Elders they represented, theCollectorandGrandmaster, respectively. Following a scheme involving setting up a new Contest of Champions with new contestants, the Maestro stole the piece of the ISO-Sphere that belonged to the Grandmaster. The two pieces of the ISO-Sphere desired to become whole again, with only their respective owners' will preventing them from becoming one. Maestro subsequently used his indomitable will to make the Collector's portion of the ISO-Sphere abandon him, and obtained the object in its entirety.[15]\nThere are 41 domains in Battleworld known, numbered and on the map, withDoomstadtas the capital of the planet:\nOther domains unidentified in the Battleworld map:"

Corvus became the first member ofThanos'Black Orderalongside his wifeProxima Midnightand his younger brotherBlack Dwarf, and served as the right-hand of the Mad Titan. One of his tasks was to force the planets harassed by Thanos to give his master a tribute.[7]After theAvengershad left theEarthtofighttheBuilders, one of thefactionsin theincursions, Thanos and the Black Order targeted Earth as their next planet to raze.[8]Corvus Glaive arrived to theJean Grey School for Higher Learning,[9]but left after realizing that Thanos' son was not there.[10]\nWhenThane, Thanos' son, was found inOrollan, the Black Order moved to that location in order for Thanos to murder his son.[11]Corvus Glaive was destroyed byHyperionwhen theAvengersarrived to Orollan in order to fight Thanos. Thanos and Proxima Midnight were frozen in an amber construct which left them in a state of living death by Thane, and they remained imprisoned in theNecropolisalong Corvus' glaive, which was all that remained of him.[12]\nCorvus trapped\nHowever, Corvus could not truly die as long as his blade was unbroken, and he began to slowly return to life inside his cell in theNecropolis.[13]As part of his secret experimentation with the amber cube,Maximusused a microscopic drill to let air reach Corvus Glaive's remains which fully regenerated him.[14]\nCorvus Glaive along with Thanos and Proxima were freed byNamor, who had had a falling out with theIlluminatifor destroying an alternate world during anIncursion, and joined hisCabal, in order to destroy another colliding Earth, as the Illuminati were resigned to their fate and were willing to let both universes die.[15]Corvus and the other members of the Cabal (excluding Namor) found great pleasure in the incursions, using them as opportunities to wreak havoc upon the other world before destroying it.[16]\nFighting alongside the Cabal\nEight months after the formation of the Cabal, Namor had finally grown weary of their wholesale slaughter.[16]Namor, now willing to turn himself in for his crimes, devised a plan with the Illuminati to destroy the Cabal. A new Incursion was on the horizon, one in which the incursive world had been ravaged by theSidera Maris. Namor would lead the Cabal to said world, activate the anti-matter injector without their knowledge, and leave them to die with said Earth, preventing them from escaping with the use of an A.I.M. platform capable of creating an impenetrable barrier between the two colliding Earths. As the Cabal engaged the Sidera Maris in combat, Namor set his plan in motion. However, he was betrayed by Black Panther and Black Bolt, who pushed him off the platform into the soon-to-be-destroyed Earth.[17]\nCorvus and the Cabal confronted Namor, who lied about his intentions, claiming he had merely been investigating the platform and had been blindsided by the barrier. Before they could press him further, they discovered an unusual event was occurring. The Earth they were in was, in addition to its incursion with Earth-616, experiencing an Incursion with another universe at the same time. Unable to return to Earth-616, the Cabal made their way to the second Incursion point, and escaped from the doomed planet into the third universe, theUltimate Universe.[18]\nThe Cabal allied themselves with the Maker, and began preparing with him for the eventual end of everything. Anticipating that the final incursion would take place between their world and the Maker's, they ensuredNick Furywould rally his world to fight theirs, buying them enough time to complete theirlife raft, which would enable them to survive the end of theMultiverse.[19]\nAs the final incursion raged, the Cabal were hard at work putting the finishing touches on their life raft, a device designed to allow them to survive the end of the Multiverse, based on the designs ofReed Richards. During the battle between Earth-1610 and Earth-616, the Maker used hisChildren of Tomorrowto buy additional time for the Cabal to complete their work. They were able to finish their craft before the incursion ended, allowing them to live past the end of everything.[20]\nEight years after the final incursion, the Cabal's life-raft was discovered and opened, awakening the Cabal. They awoke onBattleworld, a patchwork planet composed of fragments of various destroyed universes created byDoctor Doom.[21]The Cabal went on the move, trying escape the wasteland they had awoken in while plotting their next course of action. They were soon accosted by theThor Corps, the police force of Battleworld.[22]Corvus and the Cabal were more than capable of holding their own against the Thors, promptingSheriff Strangeto summon the survivors ofEarth-616to fight them. When Doom himself intervened, Strange scattered all those present across Battleworld.[23]\nCorvus and Proxima captured\nCorvus and Proxima eventually found each other, but were stumbled upon byBaron Apocalypseandhis Horsemen. Corvus and Proxima put up a fight, but were no match for the Baron and his Horsemen, leaving them grievously injured. They were turned over to Doctor Doom, who held them captured in stasis tubes and probed their minds for information about them and the other survivors.[24]\nFollowing the rebirth of the Multiverse by the hands ofMister Fantastic,[25]Corvus Glaive took advantage of Thanos' absence to buildhis own Black Order, and take theBlack Quadrant, a moon that belonged to his former master, for himself. Glaive spent the next months building his empire, taking over many planets as well as spreading his influence through the galaxy to make his army grow.\nWhen Thanos returned to reclaim what he had stolen from him, Corvus Glaive tried to fight for it, but was easily defeated by the Mad Titan. After Thanos destroyed the blade of his glaive, Corvus was given the choice to either kill himself or be killed by Thanos in the last moments of his life. Fearing to suffer in Thanos' hands, Glaive used a piece of the broken blade of his glaive to end his own life.[1]\nCorvus Glaive was returned to life by theChallengeras part of his preparations to reform the Black Order and have it fight the newLethal Legionassembled by his opponent, theGrandmaster.[2]Before the contest started, both teams were teleported to the planet chosen as battleground, Earth, in order to survey it. A fight broke out between the contestants, but was quickly cut short by their masters since the game hadn't started yet.\nSince Earth had been chosen as battleground so that its heroes could act as obstacles, the Black Order decided to launch a surprise attack onAvengers Mansion, destroying it with an explosion.[2]The plan failed sinceVoyagermanaged to teleport herself and her fellow Avengers to safety in the nick of time. Once the game started, each team was divided in half to fight for the possession of twoPyramoidsplaced on Earth by the gamemasters. Corvus Glaive was among the members of the Black Order that traveled to the Pyramoid site in Cusco,Peru.[26]A group of Avengers eventually stepped in, specifically when Corvus Glaive was close to killing the Lethal Legion'sFerene. After the AvengerHuman Torchtouched the Pyramoid,[27]and was teleported away in such a way it seemed like he had been disintegrated, the round ended. Corvus Glaive and the rest of the Black Order regrouped, with the exception of Black Dwarf, who had been taken off the board in a same way as the Human Torch after touching the other of the two Pyramoids.[28]\nThe following round, the entirety of the Black Order traveled toAntarcticato seize one of the new pair of Pyramoids activated by the Challenger and the Grandmaster. A group of Avengers attacked the villains. Struck by grief over the apparent death of the Human Torch as a consequence of the contest, Avengers co-leaderRoguebrutally attacked Corvus Glaive and used her powers to absorb his powers and psyche. After taking Corvus' glaive from him, she impaled him with her fist, killing him.[3]Despite losing possession of his glaive, Corvus returned to life. Following the end of the contest and the Avengers' victory over the Challenger, the Black Order regrouped and escaped to the planetAngargal, where they were approached by the Grandmaster with an offer.[4]\nWanting to get his hands on the mysteriousBlack Infinity Stone, Corvus went toBroxtonto kidnap Thor's little sister,Laussa. Lying to her that he would take her toGaea, he instead took her to the Forbidden Area ofNiffleheim, where long agoBorand hisValkyrieshad fought Thanos for the Infinity Stone.[29]Fighting his way through theDraugr, Corvus approached the Asgardian gates sealed by Bor, and cut Laussa's arm in order to draw her blood, as he needed the blood of Bor or his descendants to open them. Fortunately for her, while Corvus was busy opening the gates, Laussa mustered up enough strength to cause an explosion that allowed Thor andRūnato catch up to them. Corvus threatened them with Laussa's life, but Thor attacked him before he could do anything. The magic in the cave twisted the lightning ofThor's hammerinto a pack of wolves that quickly tore Corvus apart. Corvus' soul left his body behind soon after his demise.[5][6]\nSuperhuman Strength[10]\nSuperhuman Speed[10]\nSuperhuman Durability[10]\nSuperhuman Endurance[10]"

Doom used the Molecule Men bomb to slay the Beyonders and steal their power.[8]\nAlthough the Beyonders were successful in destroying the Multiverse, Doctor Doom used their power to salvage its remnants and createdBattleworld.[8]Their power was later transferred over toReed Richards, who used it to recreate the Multiverse as theEighth Cosmos.[15]\nThe Celestials creating the Beyonders\nThe Beyonders were created by theCelestials' own creation,Cal-Horra,[16][17][18]intended by the Celestials to keep maintenance of theMultiverse, theSecond Cosmos, following theCelestial War.[2]They stole Cal-Horra's power, trapped him in a moonoutsidethe Multiverse,[19]and erased him from their history.[10]Nevertheless, they were servitors of the Celestials and were called \"Omegas\" by them, in opposition to theFirst Firmament.[12]After the death of the Second Cosmos, the Beyonders watched over theMultiverses that came afterin theSecond Cosmos' remnants, outside the subsequent Multiverses.[2]\nAlthough normally working behind the scenes, they occasionally intervened to allow the creation ofCosmic Cubes.[20]When theFirst Firmamentsent some of itsAspirantsto invade theSeventh Cosmos,[12]the Omegas developed thereality warpingConcordance Enginesto draw \"miracles\" to the planetEarthso that the resulting superheroes could defend against the Aspirants. These engines, guarded by Presters,[21]were supposedly the reason for why Earth is the focal point of everything in the cosmos.[9]\nThe \"Ivory Kings\" or the \"Kings in White\"\nThe Beyonders were divided into groups. The godlikeOmega Councilcoordinated the race's actions from \"Heaven\";[22]they also created theLibrary of Worldsand gifted it to the Multiverse.[4]ThePresterslived on Earth to protect the Concordance Engines.[21]Some Beyonders became rogues and joined theBeyond Corporation.[11]\nOn Earth, the Beyonders commissioned theNuwalito create theSavage Landand created theFortisquiansto be colonizers.[23]When theHigh Evolutionarystarted to collect the extra-dimensional mass he needed to buildhis Counter-Earth, the Beyonders took notice and hired the alienSphinxorto observe his progress and make preparations to steal the planet for them once it was completed.[24]\nThe \"bomb\" to destroy the Multiverse\nWhen the Beyonders foresaw thatEnigma, aDominion, would threaten theSeventh Cosmos, they decided to destroy theMultiversethemselves, hoping that the nextEighth Cosmoswould be rid of it.[2][25]As part of their biggest experiment yet, the Beyonders created a singularity across every reality: theMolecule Man. Each Molecule Man would take his universe with him once he died and the Beyonders planned to bear witness to the simultaneous death of everything in the Multiverse. The time-travelingDoctor DoomandMolecule ManofEarth-616united forces to thwart their plans by killing every Molecule Man in existence before his natural death.[13][8]However, a contraction in the Multiverse, both in its timeline and the proximity of realities, was created when the universe of the first Molecule Man victim died with him, forcing two universes to collide, their respectiveEarthsserving as the point of impact.[26][13][27]This event became known as anincursion.[26]To the Beyonders, this was by their design.[1]\nA decade year later and two years after Doom (as \"Rabum Alal\") had founded theBlack Swans, the Beyonders noticed the interference and created theMapmakersandSidera Maristo chart worlds where Molecule Men had died, thus marking the movements of the Black Swans, seeding sacrifice worlds, and preserving future incursion worlds.[13]By derailing the Beyonders' initial goal of a simultaneous destruction, Doom believed he had caused the Beyonders' great experiment to fail,[13]but the Beyonders themselves thought otherwise and the incursions were still part of their experiment.[1][28][29][2]\nObliterating Eternity, Infinity, Lord Chaos, Master Order, and the In-Betweener\nThe Beyonders laid a trap for those trying to interfere with the incursions, like theBuildersorCaptain Britain Corps; however, their real targets werecosmic entities. The Beyonders annihilated theCelestials,Eternity,Infinity,Lord Chaos,Master Order, theIn-Betweener, and even theLiving Tribunalthroughout all realities.[30]\nDoom luring out the Beyonders\nNot long after killing theMultiversal Avengers,[1]the Beyonders were lured out of their dimension by Doctor Doom and were destroyed by his bomb made from kidnapped Molecule Men. Doom had the Molecule Man absorb their power and used it to createBattleworldout of the Multiverse's remnants.[13][8]After eight years, the Molecule Man transferred the power of the Beyonders toReed Richards, who first restored thePrime Earthand then therest of the Multiverse.[15]\nNot all of the Beyonders were killed. The race survived outside of the Multiverse, and seeing how the Multiverse was restored to how it was before, they concluded their experiment to be a failure.[2]\nAt some point, a Beyonder caused several wars in the reality ofEarth-21923. TheGuardians of the Galaxy, minusStar-Lord, were instrumental in ending the wars, but at the cost ofGroot's life.[31]\nCal-Horra, an ancient being created by theCelestialswhose power the Beyonders had stolen, escaped from his prison outside the Multiverse that the Beyonders had trapped him in. He immediately launched a vengeful campaign against the Beyonders.[19]In an effort to save himself and his people, theBeyonderattacked four other Beyonders and turned them into crystals to power a shield that would trap the Lost One onEarth, after luring him there.[32]Although the other Beyonders were grateful, they were also displeased that he attacked his fellow Beyonders to do this and banished him to Earth without his powers.[10]Anticipating that the other Beyonders would erase his memory of how to disable the shield, the Beyonder had extracted it beforehand and used it to make a deal with the Lost One. The shield was disabled, the four Beyonders powering it were absorbed by the Lost One, and he left to continue his hunt.[33]\nWith a Concordance Engine\nTheDefenders, in their journey through the \"Mystery\" beyond theFar Shore, first entered the Beyond.[34]TheBeyondergreeted them and revealed the origin of the Beyonders. The other Beyonders explained that they believed the destruction of the Seventh Cosmos was a \"necessary experiment\" to prevent theEnigma, but they have since changed tactics to contain the threat to a few realities. After a brief battle, the Defenders journeyed beyond the Beyond and into theWhite Hot Room.[2]\n\nBeyonders are non-corporeal energy beings.[35]According to theBeyonder, they are infinite beings that cannot be perceived by finite minds, but they can \"clothe\" themselves in matter to take on various forms.[2]In general, they resemble humans,grey aliens, or mechanical beings, but none of these are their true forms and they can shapeshift at will.[1]Beyonders sometimes placeOmegasymbols (Ω) on their bodies or clothes.[36][2]\nThree Beyonders slaying the Living Tribunal\nNigh-Omnipotence:The Beyonders wield omnipotence on their fingertips, a power great enough to build entire universes and give form to random ideas.[8]Although this power does not belong to them but belongs to their purported creator, Cal-Horra.[10]While in physical vessels, they can decide how powerful they are, with a single Beyonder having easily overwhelmedThor,Hyperion, andStarbrand, suffering no visible damage from their attacks until Starbrand's detonation,[1]and a trio of Beyonders having killed all the Celestials in all realities with a good bit of time and effort, before killing all theAbstract Entitiesand then theLiving Tribunalitself.[30]Such is their power that they are not constrained by space or energy or anything within reason.[1]\nA bomb made of countless Molecule Men destroying the Beyonders\nBeyonder,\"Jason Quantrell\",Omega Council,Prester John,Prester Omega."

They were once ruled byLaufeyuntil he was slain byOdin.[3]His replacement wasUrgard-Lokiwho ruledJotunheim,[4]until his return. The direct descendants of the first giant,Ymir, the Frost giants live in the area of Jotunheim whose climate resembled that of Earth's polar regions. Temperatures in this area never rise above the freezing point of water. The frost giants can exist comfortably at frigid temperatures but are highly vulnerable to heat. Although they can withstand the normal temperatures to be found inAsgardand in the temperate regions ofMidgard, intense heat causes them to shrink in size rapidly, as if they were melting. Long exposure to cold will eventually cause them to grow back to their previous size. The Frost Giants' powers are strongest in their own realm of Jotunheim, presumably due at least in part to the frigid climate of much of the realm.[5]\n...\nOdin, the King ofAsgard, marched his forces intoJotunheimto battleLaufeyand the Giants. Odin faced down and defeated Laufey, then adopted Laufey's sonLokias his own son.[6][7][3]\nThe dwarves, annoyed with Asgard's lack of leadership, created\"Thor\", a dwarf raised to resemble Thor. He was sent out and killed various people including Frost Giants. He was eventually slain by the Thunder God.[8]\nThe Frost Giants seemingly existed on Midgard during theHyborian Age, where Ymir was worshiped by theAesirandVanirofNordheim, their lord of storm and war, chief of allgods, who lived inValhalla, a snowy, shadowy domain and home of the warriors fallen in battle.[9]Frost Giants were known to live inValhal.\nHanar of ValhalandIlse, Princessof theGreat Hall of the Frost Giant, already roamed Earth before the Fall of Valhal.[10]\nAt some point, theFall of Valhaland theNight of Long Spearscaused the apparent end of the Frost Giants.[10]\nDuring theAge of Conan, though it was believed that the Frost Giants had been\"dust and legends\"since the Fall of Valhal and the Night of Long Spears,[10]Frost Giants still lived in the Hyborian world.\nSomewhere in Nordheim,Ataliwas allegedly the first-born daughter of Ymir,[11]and ademi-goddessherself.[12]She lured men to be slain by her two brothers in order to give their hearts to their father.Old Gormallegedly witnessed her. Years later, She tried to lureConanto her brothers, but Conan killed them, then pursued Atali, who managed to escape and called her father for help.[11]It remains unclear if Atali was the daughter to the well-known Asgardian Ice GiantYmir, or of another deity mistaken for or usurping his role.[13]\nJack Frostof theLiberty Legionbattled with Alies duringWorld War II. His past was a mystery, even to Jack Frost himself. So far as he can recall he has always lived in the arctic. When he encounteredThorin the modern era, Thor told Jack Frost a tale about a Frost Giant who was dwarfish in size by giant standards that fledAsgardto live on Midgard.[14]\nTheNazisawoke a sleeping Frost Giant when they were searching for theManbreaker.[15]\nThe Frost Giants attackedNornheim, and kidnapped QueenKarnilla.Balder the BraveandAgnarwent rescue her.[16]Balder snuck his way into the castle of Utgard-Loki. But he was caught and forced to fightHagen, who was armed with theLaevateinn.[5]\nBellosof the Bold Eye was aFrost Giantwizard who killed seven Frost Giant children and drained their blood to bring about the \"final cycle of the Endless Circle\" ofRagnarok.[17]He was killed by a Frost Giant's spear even as he threw the sack of blood into the Crack of Doom, thus revivingYmir.[18]\nOdin summoned Thor to fight an invasion of Frost Giants, but Thor ignored this to help Midgard. TheThermal Manfrom Midgard was sent to fight the Frost Giants and send them back to Jotunheim.[19]\nThor went to theThree Nornsand destroyed the Loom of the Fates, thus cutting offThose Who Sit Above in Shadow, possibly destroying them.[20]This also destroyedYggdrasiland ended all lives of those who dwelt in Asgard and all the other Nine Worlds including Jotunheim, except forMidgard.[21]\n...\nFrost Giants killedHrimhari's pack, during the fall of Asgard, but he was reborn on Midgard.[22]When united with Wolfsbane they were attacked by three of the Frost Giants who slaughtered Hrimhari's pack. At first they fled, but then Hrimhari and Wolfsbane decided they could no longer run and turn to face their attackers. After narrowly defeating the Frost Giants, the seemingly uninjured Rahne fainted due to unknown causes.[23]\nDr. Bruce Bannerworking forS.H.I.E.L.D.built a portal to Jotunheim in search of theAsgardianmetalUru, but due to the unstable nature of the portal they ends up in the past. They are greeted by Thor from the past who helped them when they were attacked by Frost Giants. But during the fight Banner became the Hulk and was able somehow pickMjolnir.[24]But in truth it was just Thor summoning it back and brought the Hulk along for the ride. When the team try to escape back to Earth through the portal they are attacked by the Frost Giants. Who try to squeeze through the portal to Earth. They are forced to close it trapping the team on Jotunheim.[25]Trapped in the alien world the team wait for the portal to open again, when it does they are attacked by Frost Giants.

During the battle, the League in Frost Giant territory.[27]Having gone to the Frost Giants for help, Malekith was out of reach of the League of Realms despite being only a few feet away. Despite Thor's rage, the League stood down rather than risk war with Jotunheim at the moment.[28]\nAfterRoxxon, an energy company led byDario Aggerfrom Midgard, traveled to Jotunheim to retrieve the skull of Laufey,[29]Malekith traveled toUtgardhallto meet withSkrymir, leader of the Frost Giants. The two brokered a deal between their realms. Malekith informed Skyrmir about Laufey's Skull,[30]and the Frost Giants sent a group of warriors to assist Malekith in retrieving the skull.[31][1][32]With Laufey's skull recovered, they began the magical process to resurrect their king.[33]\nLoki traveled through Jotunheim with is newly resurrected father to Bloodcycle Canyon. The two argued throughout the journey, Laufey challenged his son to travel through the canyon and survive and he would support him joining theDark Council. Loki completes the challenge using only his words causing the Frost Giants to kill themselves. Allowing Loki onto the Dark Council.[34]\nFrost Giants of Earth-717\nWhenLokitook possession of power inAsgardto the death ofOdin, he used the Frost Giants as his allies to control theAsgardiansthat led to the downfall of the realm. Asgard with Loki and the Frost Giants was finally devoured byGalactusimmediately after the Asgardian were persuaded byThorto move onMidgard.[35]\n...[36][37][38][36][37]\nFrost Giants from the Ultimate Universe\n...[39][40][41][42]\nThe Godzilla-sizedHulktraveled the mythical realm of the Norse Cosmological Zone to see this realm's pristine moon.

They then sent glaciers over toSvartalfheimand destroyed all life there. TheSword of Surturwas lost there but found byThor,Lokiand theWarriors Three. They used to kill two Frost Giants which sparked a war. Thor eventually stopped the war by giving back the sword.[44]Frost Giants would regularly attack Asgard, but were always beaten back by the Asgardians in an endless cycle.[45]\nDuringWorld War IItheRed Skullsummoned Asgardian creatures to Earth and began summoning a Frost Giant, but was stopped byCaptain AmericaandBucky.[46]Loki later convinced them that the Asgardians will attack them causing the Frost Giants to attack Asgard when Odin is on the verge of hisOdinsleep.

As with their Earth-616 counterparts they have a profound tolerance for cold. They have also demonstrated the ability to spontaneously shape crude objects from ice, a talent often employed to create rudimentary crushing, or impaling weapons. This race was once a war-faring race, under the leadership ofLaufey, that led numerous attacks on the people of Earth until the Asgardians opposed them. They were eventually forced back to Jotunheim and defeated there.Odingranted them mercy however, and confiscated the source of their power, theCasket of Ancient Winters. He also took with him the abandoned Jotun babyLoki, who grew up as a son to Odin. In the centuries that followed, Loki found out the truth of his parentage and tricked Laufey into assassinating Odin. Laufey was double-crossed and killed as part of a plan to curry favor with Odin, whereupon Loki attempted to annihilate the Jotuns by destroying their realm. This plan was foiled by the intervention of Loki's brother, Thor and while many Jotuns were killed in the incident, the race as a whole was spared.[67]\nLokiinstead of Thor receivedMjolnirand battled Frost Giants in Jotunheim.[68]\nSeeList of Frost Giants\nLoki,Laufey,Farbauti,Ilse,Hanar"

Using All-Black to construct an artificial planet to serve as his base, Gorr set about capturing and enslaving countless gods and goddesses - including several Asgardians,Thor's granddaughtersamong them - until only Thor was left. For nine hundred years, Thor battled the Black Berserkers and his growing despair, until the arrival of theThor of Earth-616restored his fighting spirit. Alongside his \"past self\" and an even younger incarnation of Earth-616 Thor abducted from the Viking Age, King Thor was able to put a stop to Gorr'splot to wipe out all gods across the temporal continuum, and cast Gorr's dark world and All-Black into ablack hole. Many of the gods captured by Gorr were given a new home in Asgard, while others chose to find new homes to settle.[8]\nMillennia later,[9]Galactusattacked Earth intending to devour it, and Thor and his granddaughters attempted to fend the cosmic entity off. Thor was forced to retrieve the All-Black symbiote from the black hole and was almost corrupted by it, but it transferred to Galactus during their battle and took him over. During the battle, Thor's divine blood was spilled onto the barren ground, revitalizing it; and he and his granddaughters were able to terraform Earth into New Midgard.[10]\nLoki traveled to Earth-616 in order to corruptThorandhis \"past self\", but was repeatedly thwarted and imprisoned.[11]\nEarth-14412 was destroyed during theIncursionsand Thor was recreated onBattleworldas the Lawspeaker of theThor Corps.[12]After the destruction of Battleworld,Reed RichardsofEarth-616set out to rebuild theMultiverse,[13]and this reality was eventually brought back to existence.\nAs the All-Black the Necroverse.\nWhile Thor and his granddaughters recreated humanity and sought to stave off the encroaching end of the universe, Galactus set out to destroy the cosmos until he was eaten byEgo the Living Planet. Taken over by the All-Black symbiote, Ego resumed destroying the cosmos until millennia later Loki took the primordial symbiote from him and destroyed him,[14]setting out to kill Thor and become the end of everything.[15][9]\nBy this point the gods who had been rescued from Gorr had all grown old and perished, leaving only Shadrak until he killed himself to save the Goddesses of Thunder from Loki's Necro-ravens. After a brutal battle that destroyed Asgard and extinguished the Sun, Thor was incapacitated by Loki. Before Loki could finish Thor off, he was impaled by the resurrected Gorr.[9]Gorr and All-Father Thor battled across the cosmos, shattering planets and destroying stars, but even with Loki joining him Thor was defeated.[16]The Goddesses of Thunder travelled toIndigarrand recruited thegods that Thor had sent there in the distant past, returning in time to rescue Thor and Loki.

As they arrive at theParliament of Pantheons, the Godbomb's effects reach the timeline ofEarth-616and all the gods present collapse asGorr's dark weaponbegins consuming them from the inside-out.\nInthe far future, theGoddesses of ThunderandYoung Thorare sent flying by the Godbomb's detonation, which destroys the entire planet. At the core of the blast,King Thorattempts to strangleGorreven as the Godbomb slowly kills him, Gorr mocking him as he loses strength and collapses. At the epicentre, where time has slowed to a crawl, Thor the Avenger reaches out and grabs both his own Mjolnir and that of King Thor, striking them together and taking the Godbomb's blast into his body. Across time, all manner of gods have a vision of Thor attempting to sacrifice himself to save them and pray to him - including his own fatherOdin. As the Mjolnirs crack and crumble, theliving darknessceases its temporal assault and engulfs Thor.AtliandFriggmarvel that they're still alive, but Young Thor points out that Gorr is too. Shocked by his defeat, Gorr wonders where his Black Berserkers, towers, and weapon have gone. Clad in armor of living darkness and wielding two Mjolnirs, Thor the Avenger speaks in a distorted voice and tells Gorr that his dark weapon has a name - All-Black the Necrosword - and that it mocks him for thinking he - originally a mere mortal - could unleash its full power when it's meant to be wielded by a god. As Gorr begs Thor to return All-Black to him, Thor states that he was right when he said it was meant to kill gods - blasting him with bolts of divine lightning and darkness. Badly wounded, Gorr denounces the gods as the doom of life, only forAgarto suddenly appear and ask if it was a god who killed his mother. Agar denounces Gorr as the god of hypocrisy, stating that it wasn't the gods who betrayed Gorr, but Gorr who betrayed himself as he melts into living darkness. The three Thors and the Goddesses of Thunder watch as the darkness that was once Agar forms into a small jagged stone dagger; King Thor explaining to his confused younger selves that \"Agar\" was actually a manifestation of Gorr's subconscious self-loathing and desire to be put out of his misery, manifested through All-Black. As Gorr lets out a scream of despair, Young Thor smugly decapitates him with Jarnbjorn. Thor the Avenger abruptly collapses, vomiting living darkness as King Thor notes that All-Black is still inside him and needs to be purged. Thor the Avenger states that it's too late before collapsing, dead for the ninth time.\nOn Asgard three days later, Thor the Avenger awakens musing about a hellish dream he'd had where there were three of him. He abruptly realizes it wasn't a dream when King Thor grumps that dying must've made him even dumber than before, Young Thor quipping that he's probably thirsty too. Thor the Avenger asks what became of Gorr and the Necrosword, King Thor stating that Gorr's body was immolated and that the Necrosword was left where it fell. Young Thor boasts that he would've taken the Necrosword for himself, but that King Thor destroyed it by throwing the entire planet into ablack holebefore he could do so. King Thor states that he burnt out the last of the Thor-Force purging the remnants of All-Black from Thor's body and resurrecting him, asking his younger self if he'd like to see what he died for. King Thor takes his younger selves on a tour of Asgard, which is being rebuilt and settled by the survivors from Gorr's mines - who are free to return to their old worlds or find new ones whose gods were slain. Young Thor remarks that he's still finding it hard to believe he becomes the All-Father, noting that by Asgard's decrepit condition he does a terrible job. King Thor retorts that his youngest self will learn the hard way that he's terrible at a number of things, will watch many loved ones die as a result, and will never acquire the one thing he desires most. Young Thor notes that King Thor wielding two Mjolnirs means he's wrong, but King Thor states he's talking about obtaining Odin's approval. Angered, Young Thor storms off, complaining that his future self is just as stern and callous as his father before demanding to be returned to his proper time. Thor the Avenger chastizes King Thor for being so harsh with their past self, but King Thor states he was also talking to himself. Elaborating, he states that he owes Thor the Avenger a great debt for rekindling his determination, but that he cannot look at him without feeling immense self-loathing at everything he failed at. King Thor tells Thor the Avenger to avert this future by being a better Thor than him and by killingLokithe first chance he gets; Thor the Avenger replying by telling him to live to the end of time and prove Gorr wrong. King Thor asks what they should do if Gorrwasn'twrong, Thor the Avenger stating that just means they have their work cut out for them. Recalling a certain world whose brutal gods were killed, Thor the Avenger has All-Father Thor send some of the homeless gods toIndigarr. King Thor uses the power of the All-Father to return his past selves to their proper times, their memories of having met each other being erased in the process.\nReturning to Asgard, Young Thor attempts to lay claim to Mjolnir and manages to get the hammer to budge slightly. King Thor catches up with his granddaughters before settling down on his throne, and Thor the Avenger travels to Indigarr to tell the child who had prayed to him that her world is no longer without gods.\n• The grand finale of the epic time-traveling saga of the God Butcher that began in issue #1."

His mother replies that they are leaving it as an offering for their gods, so that they watch over them and keep them safe. Gorr asks why the gods didn't take care of his father when he got sun fever, and his mother replies that Gorr's father lived a long life of almost thirty years, and that they'll see him again in the afterlife. Gorr is dissatisfied with her answer, but she urges him to always honor the gods so that they shower him with blessings like they have her. Their conversation is interrupted as a pack ofSand Tigersattack, Gorr's mother telling him to run as she hefts her spear. Gorr flees, his mother asking the gods to watch over her son; but she is killed by the beasts.\nYears later, Gorr urges his pregnant wife, Arra, to eat what little food he was able to find. She tells him that the sky gods will hear their prayers and come soon, but when she calls him a great hunter Gorr laments their tribe's desperate situation - slowly starving while skulking in a cliffside cave. Arra tells her husband that the gods will provide and that he just has to put his life in their hands, but a sudden earthquake strikes and sends her plunging off the cliff to her death.\nSeveral months later, Gorr treks with his tribe through the desert, carrying his last surviving child, Agar, who is dying from starvation. Agar recalls his sisters died of sun fever; Gorr trying to comfort him as he wastes away. After Agar dies, Gorr mournfully buries his son, too dehydrated to cry for him.Rugokk, the tribe's chief, chastises him for not hanging Agar from a tree so that the gods will see him and take him into the afterlife. Rugokk tells Gorr not to damn Agar the way Arra was damned, but Gorr bitterly remarks that they're all damned anyway. Deciding to give up all pretence, Gorr snaps that the tribe moves from one desolate cave to another, leaving a trail of starved and heat-stricken bodies in its wake. Rugokk angrily berates Gorr for his blasphemy, but Gorr says that the gods did nothing to save his mother when she was eaten alive in front of their idol, or his wife when she was buried alive with their unborn child still inside her. In response to Rugokk's horror, Gorr addresses the tribe and proclaims that the reason why the gods do not intervene to save them is because they do not exist; but before he can continue his tirade he is struck in the face by a large stone. Gorr's tribesmen pelt him with stones, decrying him as a blasphemous agent of the black gods and considering eating him alive. Rugokk intervenes and banishes Gorr from the tribe, praying that the gods will have mercy on him.\nGorr wanders the desert, praying for the endless abyss of death. Just as he collapses out of exhaustion, an explosion in the sky catches his attention and what appears to be a meteor rips a crater into the ground nearby. Curiosity aroused, Gorr peers into the crater to seea black-armored godwieldinga swordand a gold-armored god wielding a spear; each having having impaled the other. As Gorr is struck by the realization that gods do exist after all, the gold-armored god pleads for him to help. Enraged, Gorr lashes out at the god for having the audacity to ask him for help, when his people, his wife, and his mother have suffered and died praying for divine intervention. The dark god's sword transforms intoan amorphous mass of living darknessand latches onto Gorr, condensing into a crude, jagged dagger. Full of vengeful rage, Gorr kills the gold-armored god before gazing up at the sky and wondering if there are more gods out there. The living darkness bonded to him transforms into a winged suit of armor, enabling him to fly into space and embark on his career as the God Butcher.\nMillennia later. Gorr stands overVolstagg, clad in black armor and whipping him with a cat-o-nine tails manifested from the All-Black symbiote as he narrates his backstory. Volstagg mocks him for not knowing the name of the god from whom he stole All-Black the Necrosword, let alone where the legendary weapon came from. As Volstagg sneers that Gorr is blind to its true nature, Gorr redoubles his lashings and demands to know what makes him think he had the right to steal from him. Volstagg protests that it was only a loaf of bread; but Gorr reiterates that the bread was not his, and that he is only allowed to eat what he is given. Volstagg remarks that all he's had to eat for 500 years are worm feces and his own scabs, but Gorr says that the sooner the gods finish their work the sooner their hunger will be sated forever. Volstagg mockingly asks when the last time Gorr hungered or even slept was, but Gorr snarls that he'll sleep when his work is done and all the gods are dead. Volstagg sneers that Gorr will never kill all the gods regardless of what weapon he uses; Gorr commenting on the stubbornness of Asgardians before mockingly asks if Volstagg thinksThorwill save him. Volstagg denies this, but states that even if Gorr kills every other god in existence, there will still be one left: Gorr himself. In response to Gorr's livid incredulity, Volstagg remarks that All-Black has indefinitely prolonged Gorr's lifespan and made him powerful enough to raze entire worlds and build his own, slaughtering indiscriminately that which should be immortal; asking what Gorr is if not the most vile and abhorrent dark god in existence. Unamused, Gorr forms a hammer and nail from All-Black, crucifying Volstagg and leaving him to die with the other gods who've especially displeased him.\nA replica of Agar watches from nearby, Gorr addressing him and telling him that Volstagg can't hurt him. \"Agar\" states that he's hungry, Gorr taking his hand and saying that he'll have one of the slaves prepare whatever his son wants. Looking back at Volstagg, \"Agar\" asks when all the bad gods will be gone, and Gorr replies that it will be very soon."

Maiming and crucifying Thor, Gorr laments that for the first time in eons he was finally at peace in a world without gods... only to be unceremoniously resurrected byKing Loki.\nTurning to Loki, Gorr contemptuously asks if the embodiment of everything he hates about deities has any lies for him, but Loki instead offers up the remnants of All-Black still bonded to him. Thor protests that Gorr will kill Loki too, but Gorr silences him and replies that Loki is likely well-aware of that. Smirking, Gorr acknowledges Loki as a fellow butcher despite his divinity, Loki replying that they'll have to compare body counts and discuss the minutia of genocide at a later point. Chuckling, Gorr crucifies Loki and tells Thor that the God of Lies resurrected him because - even after eons of hatred and enmity - he wasn't sure he'd be able to go through with killing his own brother. As Gorr dismisses Loki as a cowardly child on the inside and sadistically asks if they should find out what All-Father Thor looks like on the inside, All-Father Thor retaliates by blasting Gorr with a beam ofThor-Force, sending him into orbit.\nBreaking free of his crucifix, Thor commands Loki to stand and fight alongside him, but Loki remains hanging from his crucifix and morosely remarks that Gorr lied about why he'd resurrected him. Thor angrily grumbles that he'll do everything himself like he always has - summoningMjolnirfrom theabyss-blackenedSun- deviating through the ruins ofAsgardand snagging theOdinsword. Surmising that Loki resurrected Gorr because he wasn't sure he could go through with killing him, Thor snaps that Loki needs to show him more than faint glimmers of hope for redemption; adding that if Loki refuses to help him then he'll kill Gorr himself and come back to do what Loki couldn't - kill his brother. As Thor takes off in pursuit of Gorr, Loki chuckles before letting out a maniacal laugh.\nIn orbit, Gorr recalls how he'd died and blames the betrayal of his \"family\" on the gods, recalling the disparate pieces of All-Black to himself. As Thor arrives, shouting that Gorr should have stayed dead and will now suffer the wrath ofAsgard; Gorr manifests All-Black as a colossal double-bladed sword he calls \"Annihilablade the Planet Cleaver,\" sneering that he should have saved himself a lot of pain and trouble and just let time dispose of all the gods before finishing Thor off.\nLightyears away, the \"Necro-Ravens\" harrying theGoddesses of Thundersuddenly depart -Friggwondering if it's a good sign andAtlilamenting that her petstarshark,Death Mouth, is disappointed. As Frigg suggests they turn back,Ellisivconsults theSaga of the God Butcherand notes thatShadrakhad told them to go back to the beginning. Asking her sisters how this saga began, Frigg reminds them that eons ago Thor hadonce been called to a planet by a prayer-the same planetthey are now approaching.\nOn New Midgard, Loki snaps at a praying human to shut up and let him die in peace. As the human asks if he's praying right, Loki rebukes him - saying that regardless of whether or not he's praying right there are no gods left to answer them and that soon they will all be dead. As the human says he will pray for Loki as well, Loki angrily tells him to stop and that it's the end of everything.\nElsewhere in the cosmos, Gorr and Thor clash - their battle shattering entire planets. Recognizing the solar system as one with three dying stars, Thor decides to use them to immolate Gorr and rebuild the cosmos from his ashes. Merging the suns into one massive orb of plasma, Thor launches it at Gorr. Effortlessly cleaving through it, Gorr sneers that he likes Thor's plan and remarks that he's finally realized his mistake in thinking that eliminating the gods would cause the mortals to realize they no longer need divinity.\nGorr cocoons Thor with a glob of living abyss and the moldering bones of the mortals who inhabited the shattered worlds, sneering that the gods have leftthe universea charnel house. Grabbing a bone and snapping it, Gorr declares his intent to butcher all life in the universe - starting with Thor's precious Midgard - and create it anew; self-sufficient with no need for godly guidance. Snapping that watching his creations flourish with no idea of the old gods who had existed before would be the ultimate repudiation of Thor, Gorr grabs him and sneers that deep down Thor knows he's right.\nBefore Gorr can finish Thor off, a golden lasso snares him by the neck, Loki snapping that he didn't resurrect Gorr so that he could kill Thor. Trying to strangle the God of God Butchers, Loki states that he's been longing to kill Thor since he was an infant and dismisses Gorr as a bow-legged caveman who found a magic rock. Gorr furiously severs Loki's right arm and encases him in All-Black, remarking that he now understands - the life Loki couldn't bear to take wasn't Thor's, but his own. Gorr mocks and blinds Loki, slowly constricting him, but Thor bashes him away.\nAs Thor checks on his brother, Loki quips that Gorr will regret not cutting out his tongue as well before telling Thor to get away while he has the chance, admitting that he'd intended to kill Thor himself and then die by Gorr's hand. As Loki despairs, Thor tries to rekindle his brother's fighting spirit by saying that he's beaten Gorr and countless other butchers like him before. Engulfing them in All-Black, Gorr sneers that there are no other butchers like him, declaring that he transcended mortality long ago. Still refusing to categorize himself as a god, Gorr instead declares himself a force of nature akin to an ocean and tells Thor to drown.\nSinking into the All-Black, Thor struggles and calls out to Loki, who snaps at Thor to leave him to die, and better yet to die alongside him. Thor tries to restore Loki's fighting spirit one last time by telling him that he'd lied aboutFreyjahaving given up on him and that she'd died saying that one day Loki would save them all. Reaching out to his estranged brother, Thor apologizes for having failed everyone. Their hands nearly connect, but as they both lose consciousness they drift apart and are lost to the darkness.\nIT’S THE BATTLE FORETOLD FOR CENTURIES:\nTHOR VS. LOKI IN THE FINAL FIGHT OF THE MILLENNIA!"

Two have been caught in the Domain of Apocalypse, and brought before God Emperor Doom while comatose. Based on reports, Valeria identifies the two as \"Corbis and a proxy\", but Doom pauses her to ask Black Swan, who has come to serve him. She corrects the report: they are Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight, husband-and-wife generals of Thanos. When the Thors struck, the rebels scattered, and now none of them know what the others will do. This is troublesome.\nLater, at Foundation, Alex & Bentley have a report for Valeria. Based on her desire to find out what is being hidden from her, they finished their assessment of where God Emperor Doom's power is coming from, and it is somewhere in Doomstadt. Another matter: drone aircraft have been appearing in flocks around the world, and more have been found. Valeria wonders aloud who is building these devices.\nAt Project 42, two men are debating the best method to assassinate God. One, Reed Richards, points out that as they currently have no idea what will happen to the universe if its god dies, then their debate should shift from \"can they kill God\" to \"shouldthey kill God\". The second man, the Maker, refuses this argument, saying that God Emperor Doom is unworthy of the role he has sought. The Maker pulls up footage of an uprising: a vast horde of Doom-deniers, marching on Doomstadt, led by a skull-visaged figure who calls himself \"The Prophet\". The Maker removes his helmet, revealing that he is a younger alternate-universe version of Reed Richards, and wonders what could ever turn him into such a careworn old man. Reed says that it comes from caring for others, but the Maker cuts him off, pointing to drone footing of the First Family of Battleworld - Doom, his wife Susan Storm, and their children, Franklin and Valeria. This makes Reed pause, but he continues, saying that they need to find out where Doom's power is coming from, and he has a plan.\nIn Castle Doom, Peter Parker and Miles Morales, the Spider-Men, are tracking down Doom's power. They have got as far as a statue in the garden and get lost. Valeria, who is also looking, directs them to a trapdoor at the base of the statue. From their scanning device, she realizes that they are working for the drone-maker - Reed Richards, who she has never heard of - and says that in exchange for not raising the alarm, she demands two answers: are they from the crashed ship, and did one of the ship people kill Strange. Parker says that there was a second ship, and that no-one from either ship killed Strange. Troubled, Valeria walks away.\nOn the other side of the trapdoor is a glowing white space and one man - Owen Reese, the Molecule Man. Reese says he can feel the pieces not fitting, how he devoured everything and is still hungry. Miles realizes that he has a three-week-old hamburger in his pocket, and offers it to Reese, who devours it, to Peter's horror. Sated, Reese introduces himself as the font of Doom's power.\nUpstairs, Doom is in teleconference with his barons regarding the Prophet. After he accuses them of collusion, they deny it, and encourage him to destroy the uprising. Doom agrees, but says that as a test of loyalty, the barons must supply the forces and lead them.\nAfter the call ends, Mister Sinister, baron for the domain of Bar Sinister, turn to his newest friend, a corrupted Captain Marvel, and asks for advice. After she punches him a few times, which he seems to draw pleasure from, he resolves to be\"naughty\", a course she approves of.\nAt sea, Namor and Black Panther have made the journey to the Hidden Isle of Agamotto, Stephen Strange's base. Namor marvels that they have not killed each other, but Black Panther says it would be pointless: they are kings of ashes and dead men; there is nothing for them to fight over. They are able to pass the first door with the Eye of Agamotto, and are able to disarm the security golems using and old Illuminati passcode. Once inside, a recording of Stephen Strange hopes that is death has not been in vain. To whoever got in, he bequeaths two objects. The first is the Siege Courageous, a means of instant teleportation anywhere in the world. The second is an Infinity Gauntlet which grants the wearer unlimited power, but only in one area: Doomstadt. With these two objects, one could assassinate God.\nAt Castle Doom, Franklin Richards is being put to bed by his mother. He asks her to tell him about the Fantastic Four, so she complies: Once upon a time, four explorers took a spaceship ride. They were Sue & Johnny Storm, their father Franklin Storm, and their friend Ben Grimm. Empowered by the journey, they brought wonder to their world, until their world ended, and a new world began. This new world of constant battle killed Franklin Storm, but Victor von Doom used his great power to conquer it, bringing peace. Johnny Storm left his family to become the Sun and drive out the night. Ben Grim left also. Franklin says his mother never says what happened to Ben Grimm, and Susan says she will, once he is older.\nAt the Shield, on the detention level, Thanos is face-to-face with Ben Grimm, who sacrificed himself to become part of the the thing that holds back the monsters. Thanos says that the world is not as he believes it to be, that Doom lied because he feared Grimm's power. He asks what Grimm intends to do about it.\nOn the sudden border of the world, a vast swathe of the Shield rises up in the shape of a man, and marches north on Doomstadt..."

On his dark world,Gorrrips a fissure open into the planet's mantle and castsThor the Avengerinto its molten depths; encasing theMjolnirsin a cage of dead and wounded gods andliving abyss. Clad inarmor formed from eldritch darkness, Gorr drags Young Thor to witness the detonation of theGodbomb.Arraapproches Gorr and asks if he's alright, but he sternly tells her to get back inside as it's time to detonate the Godbomb. Arra is overjoyed, praising Gorr for never wavering in his conviction, no matter the odds against him, and saying that he is the only being worthy of being called a god. When Arra says that he is her god, Gorr abruptly stops and turns to look at her in rage, telling her to repeat herself. Before Arra can do so, Gorr kills her, snarling that he is no-one's god.Agararrives and asks Gorr if it's time to detonate the Godbomb, asking where his mother is. Gorr tells him to look for her in the towers, but not to wait for him as he has too many gods to kill. Agar eagerly states it's finally time to kill them all, glancing to where Arra's body is melting into molten darkness.\nEntangled in the cage encasing the Mjolnirs,Friggattempts to grab one of them.Ellisivrebukes her for thinking herself worthy of wielding it, asking if she thinks she could do what three Thors failed to; but Frigg snaps that she'd rather die hammer in hand than snared like a fly in a web. Uncharacteristically subdued,Atlitells her sisters to save their energy, and when Frigg irritably asks what she should be saving it for Atli says she'd rather die by her own hand than grant Gorr the satisfaction of killing her. Unwilling to give up, Frigg resumes struggling to reach one of the Mjolnirs.\nReaching the Godbomb, Gorr remarks to Young Thor that his masterpiece is beautiful, explaining that it was designed byShadrakof theDiamond Moons of Oghogho- after he'd been driven insane by the brutal murders of all his friends, of course. Conjuring a staircase of darkness, Gorr explains that the Godbomb will use the heart of the infant elder god and thePool of Foreversto spread his weapon's eldritch darkness across time and space, killing every deity that has ever existed and ever will exist - stating that Young Thor's blood should suffice to complete it.\nMiles below, Thor struggles to climb out of the volcanic fissure only to be approached by Agar, who tells him he'll never make it in time. Thor tells Agar to get away from the lava and get off-world; but Agar states that he cannot leave, adding that he is what Gorr made him to be. Agar philosophically muses to Thor that the real question is not what he is, but what Gorr is; stating that Gorr used to be a good and simple man who suffered unjustly, and wondering what the Gorr of the past would have to say about his present self. Spotting the weapons of the enslaved gods entombed in the rock, Thor begins excavating them and again tells Agar to take his family and leave. Agar states that his mother is dead; lamenting that she had deluded herself dreaming of a peaceful life in a world without gods, but that she was killed by Gorr just as he'd killed the kind man he'd once been. Stating that Gorr is dead, Agar uses tendrils of darkness to save Thor the Avenger from falling into the lava and says that he will pray for him to kill the evil deity known as the God Butcher. As the planet quakes, Ellisiv expresses dismay, Frigg tells her sisters she loves them and looks forward to seeing them in Valhalla, and Atli shouts that Gorr can kiss her divine backside. The living darkness binding them promptly evaporates, unceremoniously dropping them to the ground as boulders containing confiscated weapons crashland around them. Frigg and Ellisiv arm themselves as Atli unsuccessfully tries to lift Thor the Avenger's Mjolnir, which to her dismay lifts into the air before plunging into the ground.\nAt the core of the Godbomb, Gorr presses Young Thor's face against the infant elder god's heart, stating that his death will baptize the Godbomb. Thor uses the last of his strength to bite out one of Gorr's eyeballs, Gorr instinctively flinging him out of the Godbomb. Young Thor crashlands next to Atli, who is brandishing his Jarnbjorn, and promptly takes it back. Atli protests and mocks Young Thor for not being worthy of Mjolnir yet, but he uses the divine axe to kill a Black Berserker as the monsters manifest and swarm the rioting gods. Thor the Avenger erupts from the Earth as King Thor rides a meteor back down to Gorr's dark world, but they are too late: a Black Berserker rips the heart out of a feline deity and delivers it to Gorr, who completes the Godbomb. As tendrils of living abyss blossom across the Godbomb, Thor the Avenger and King Thor plunge into it - Gorr greeting them at its core and triumphantly declaring his victory. King Thor furiously tackles Gorr, Thor the Avenger noting that Gorr already activated the bomb and asking what to do. King Thor tosses Thor the Avenger his Mjolnir, telling him to do what he always does and hit it with a hammer. Dual-wielding the Mjolnirs, Thor the Avenger strikes the Godbomb's core with all his strength, sending divine lightning surging through it, but his fears that Gorr had been right all along get the better of him and the Godbomb detonates before he can deal the finishing blow.\nGODBOMB - Part Four of Five\n• The penultimate chapter in the saga of the God Butcher.\n• Thus comes the final battle against Gorr, as three Thors lead an army of slave gods in the fight to save all of divinity."

Strange concludes that Doom is in \"a damn tricky mood\" and Doom concludes the same of Strange. The two reminisce about creating Battleworld, and Doom tells Strange that he has his trust and full favor.

As they continue discussing, Doom reveals his dissatisfaction with one aspect of Battleworld; himself, stating that he has failed in inspiring his people, which accounts for their restlessness. He goes on to say that perhaps he should have kept himself hidden instead of involving himself so closely in the matters of mortals, finally lamenting that for all his powers he still cannot fix his damaged face.

As reporters converge to ask him questions, he tells them he's still recovering from the incident; adding that it's not the time for questions, but for answers. Stating that the city was attacked bytrolls, which he claims killed his legal team and very nearly himself, Agger states that the reason the trolls laid waste to Broxton was their enmity towardsthe floating cityof self-proclaimed deities. Stating himself a God-fearing individual like any good American citizen, Agger declares that the Asgardians and their rogues' gallery have no place in the world of mortals and should be sent back towhere they came from.\nApproaching Asgardia,S.H.I.E.L.D.AgentRoz Solomonconfers withJennifer Walters; who states she managed to get Roxxon's injunction againstThorlifted but that public opinion has turned against the Norse deities to the point that Congress is debating lifting Asgardia's embassy status. When She-Hulk states that Roz might be able to use her status as Thor's girlfriend to convince him to talk him out of fighting, Roz denies that she and Thor are involved and hangs up on She-Hulk in irritation upon hearing thatTony Starkis responsible for the rumor. Parking her flying car, Roz is greeted byHeimdalland says she's looking for Thor. As Heimdall says that one doesn't need All-Sight to find Thor, merely listen, a crack of thunder peals over the city and Roz remarks that he must've seen the news.\nInside Asgardia's main hall, theAll-Mother Freyjascolds Thor for using his storm powers indoors, Thor stating that he's venting his anger and grief at the foolishness of the Congress' debate to expel Asgardia. Freyja tells Thor that there is some truth to Roxxon's lies in that the Asgardians are a danger to Midgard and the mortals, and that while the Asgardians needed to seek refuge on Midgard to recover and rebuild that time has now passed. Freyja remarks thatMalekithis schemingsomething awefuland that the Asgardians need to return to their realm in order to prepare for it. Thor laments thatOdinwouldn't allow himself to be pushed around by Roxxon, but Freyja says that even Odin would have to submit to her decree that Asgardia must leave Midgard; revealing thatGaiaandIdunnhave separated from her to return to Earth and scout for new homes along the world tree respectively. Commanding Thor to perform his princely duty, Freyja threatens to strip him of Mjolnir and bestow it to someone more worthy if he refuses to comply... though she lowers the queenly mask for a moment, telling Thor she empathizes with his pain and assuring him that they are not forsaking the people of Midgard.\nAs Roz marvels at the sheer size of Asgardia, she is hailed by Freyja. Greeting the All-Mother, Roz is surprised to hear that she not only knows of but approves of her romance with Thor. Approaching Thor, Roz awkwardly asks if he's been telling people they're dating. Thor begrudgingly informs her that Roxxon has won and Darrio Agger has not only gotten away with his crimes but succeeded in having Asgardia banished from Midgard. Roz is shocked to hear Thor is leaving, asking what he intends to do about Broxton. Thor states that when he first came to Midgard millennia ago, it was to make war and revelry, to be feared and worshipped by the puny mortals, and to destroy. Looking out over the ruins of Broxton, Thor sadly asks Roz if he's changed since then; and Roz tells him that he won't find the answer in Asgardia.\nDescending to Broxton alongsideVolstagg,Sif, and a group of other Asgardians, Thor tells the people of Broxton that they have come to humbly ask a favor. Leading the other gods in kneeling, Thor asks if they can be of assistance in rebuilding. Later,Jane Fosterreminds Thor that he helped minimize casualties and that most of the losses were to property; Thor replying that because of Asgardia the people of Broxton have lost their homes, their livelihoods, and their history. When Thor laments that he is unworthy of protecting Midgard, Jane worriedly asks if he's leaving. Thor says he could never do that, but was meaning to ask if she might; asking that she speak on behalf of Asgard before the Congress of Worlds. Jane protests that she can't because of her cancer, but Thor assures her that theBifrostcan transport her anywhere she needs to go. Suspicious, Jane reminds Thor that she doesn't want to use magic to get rid of her cancer; and Thor assures her that's not what he meant, teasingly adding that she can even bring her boyfriend along as Asgard's latest stable-boy. Jane confesses she broke up with Walter due to her cancer putting things in perspective, Thor again lamenting the role he played in Broxton's destruction.\nAs Dario Agger walks to his car, telling reporters he won't be taking any questions, Roz sucker-punches him in the face. As she's grabbed by Roxxon guards and hauled away, she shouts that she knows he's the Minotaur and will stop at nothing to prove he was culpable in Broxton's destruction. His eyes glowing red, Agger threatens to sue her into oblivion only for her to remind him that he fed his lawyers to trolls as she storms off.\nLater, Freyja gathers the other Asgardians to bid farewell to the people of Broxton, asking Volstagg and Sif if they've seen Thor. Volstagg remarks that he saw Thor flying towards Asgardia a while back, wondering if the God of Thunder decided to spare himself the emotional goodbye. Speaking to the people of Broxton, Freyja announces that the Asgardians will be leaving, promising to nevertheless keep watch over them. As a parting gift, Freyja informs the citizens of Broxton that the Asgardians are leaving them a fountain that never runs dry, some divine apple trees, and a stockpile of gold. As the Asgardians leave, a child protests to her mother that the gods didn't fix their hometown, sadly wondering where the people of Broxton will go. Answering the child's question, Thor descends from above carrying one of the buildings of Asgardia - a skyscraper-sized castle. Depositing it on the ground, Thor states that he sadly can't return what they have lost, but that his gift will hopefully serve as a token towards repaying the debt he owes them. Speaking to the child, Thor offers her and her family the first choice of a room, delighting her. Watching from the Bifrost, Roz asks Freyja if Thor can really just tear off a chunk of Asgard and give it away; Freyja replying that the building in question was Bilskirnir, the greatest of all of Asgard's halls. Roz incredulously asks who it belonged to, Freyja saying that it belonged to Thor himself.\nAs Asgardia ascends into space, Freyja tells Jane Foster that they have a lot of work ahead of them, Jane agreeing before asking what she thinks of Thor's new girlfriend. On Midgard, Thor tells Roz that he's going to get drunk and find himself a new place to sleep. Roz remarks that he's taking everything rather well, Thor replying that Freyja taught him that sometimes people must learn to let go of that which they love.\nOn Roxxon Island, Dario Agger states that he just waged war with a god, levelled an entire town just to spite him, and got away with it scott-free; asking his guest -Ulik- if he knows how that makes him feel. Looking up from his dinner, Ulik supposes it makes Agger feel like a troll, but Agger retorts that he's bored. Stating that Roxxon is already unstoppable by mortal or deity and that the corporation pillaging the Earth into ruination is a given, he asks what comes next; noting that while they've already begun mining on Mars and Jupiter's moons, space exploration seems mundane. Agger asks Ulik where he comes from, and the troll king replies that he was born in the caves underNornheimback when Asgard was still a realm unto itself. Intrigued, Agger asks to hear more about the Nine Realms, and more importantly who he'd have to kill to conquer them.\nInthe distant future, theGoddesses of ThunderapproachAll-Father Thor,Friggtelling her grandfather that they forged another river and asking what he wants to call it. All-Father Thor chooses to name it after Roz,Atliwondering why he keeps picking strange names - Thor having been naming them after his long-dead friends and loved ones. Remarking that the names he picks are unforgettable, Thor states that they still have a lot of work to do as he leads his granddaughters across a field.\nOn Mars, barren except for a few derelect Roxxon facilities,Galactusplants his drill while grumbling about Thor's audacity and arrogance at having denied him the right to consume Earth. As Galactus sneers that if it hadn't been forAll-Blackhe would have killed Thor and consumed Earth, he remarks that at least the eldritch weapon was destroyed and that the next time he meets Thor will be the last. He's cut off as living abyss suddenly engulfs him- the All-Black symbiote having secretly transferred from Thor to him - and lets out a scream of agony that transitions into a maniacal laugh as the primordial symbiote bonds to him, transforming him into the Butcher of Worlds.\n• THE LAST DAYS OF MIDGARD Aftermath\n• Thor’s battle against ROXXON has colossal ramifications for all of Asgard. And also for… Jane Foster?"

Captain America goes for Thanos, only to be defeated and ordered to be further decimated by some of Thanos' soldiers. Even Hulk is reverted back into Bruce Banner by Proxima Midnight, after she used an attack that released the weight of a star on his back.

In Wakanda, Supergiant uses her control over Black Bolt to force him to activate one of the bombs the Illuminati hid in Wakanda's Necropolis[1]in order to destroy Earth and both herself and Thanos along with it. When the Illuminati arrive to save Black Bolt, Supergiant uses the Inhuman King's ability to defeat the heroes. Upon activating the bomb, Supergiant is faced by Maximus, who has the trigger. Maximus triggers the bomb, but also uses Lockjaw to transport Supergiant along with the bomb to a distant uninhabited planet where the bomb goes off, killing her.[2]Black Widow takes control of a ship and contacts the other teams, telling the Black Order to surrender. Iron Man heads over to where the other Avengers are. Thane tells them all that Thanos is still a threat. Hyperion is almost defeated by Corvus Glaive and Captain America gets shot by Proxima Midnight, but he also deflects a shot into Corvus Glaive, injuring him and letting Hyperion to kill him with his heat vision. Thanos regains his composure and defeats Thor and Captain Marvel. Before Thanos can kill all of the Avengers, Thane uses his powers to lock Thanos and Proxima Midnight inside an cube of an amber construct which left them in a state of \"living death\", and the Avengers win at last.\nSeveral weeks later, the heroes begin rebuilding. The Inhumans find a new home, and the new Avengers recruits do as well, though they remain on the team. The Super-Skrull becomes the king of the Skrull Empire, and the Illuminati seal Thanos and Proxima Midnight away without telling the Avengers.\n• All roads lead to this!\n• The over-sized conclusion of the Marvel Summer event!"

Passing the moldering corpses of long-dead alien gods, Atli complains that the ruins stink of death, adding that they shouldn't be there. Agreeing with her hot-tempered sister, Frigg tells Ellisiv that they should turn back, but Ellisiv refuses. As they enter what was once theHalls of All-Knowing, Atli complains that the decaying books will smell like a leper's latrine and Frigg reiterates that they need to go back to Asgard and help Thor prepare for his final battle. Scanning the decaying shelves, Ellisiv wonders how life is supposed to persist when even the gods cannot.\nA voice answers that it isn't, and the three goddesses turn to see an elderly four-eyed god with tendrils extending from his head. The elderly god states that life is supposed to fade away and die, before remarking that a very long time ago he was supposed to have died as well, asking the goddesses if he is indeed still alive. As Atli complains that all they found was a madman, Ellisiv asks him if he is the Lord High Librarian. He replies that he helped the originalLord High Librarianwith his duties and took over for a few million years after the Lord High Librarian grew too old to do so himself. Introducing himself asShadrak, the elderly deity remarks that he's forgotten what he was the god of. As Shadrak laments that time did whatGorr the God Butchercouldn't, Ellisiv protests that the gods of the universe can't all be gone.\nShadrak states that he's well aware of the purpose of their visit, rallying allies for a last stand againstAll-Black the Necrosword- a primordial symbiote forged at the beginning of another universe byKnull, stolen by Gorr, wielded by theThorof the past and their own grandfather, and passed down over the millennia fromGalactustoEgoand finally their great-uncleLoki. Before Shadrak can finish, he is attacked by \"necro-ravens\" -- corvids made of living abyss, and Loki's permutation of Gorr'sBlack Berserkers. As Atli and Frigg fend the necro-ravens off, Ellisiv tells Shadrak that she's thoroughly researched the history of the Necrosword and its wielders, having fought against Gorr herself eons ago. Badly wounded, Shadrak tells her that she doesn't have the whole story because it hasn't ended -- pointing to a book titled theSaga of the God Butcherand saying that it hasn't finished writing itself.\nAmidst the flaming ruins of Asgard, All-Father Thor and Loki the Necrogod clash, Mjolnir against All-Black. As Thor furiously berates Loki for destroying Asgard, Loki mockingly sneers that Thor thought he could be contained in a pit ofMuspelheimvipers, but that he ate them and escaped - devouring Ego the Necroworld on his way there. Announcing his intent to destroy everything - starting with Thor - Loki smashes Thor through Asgard. Crashlanding on a rotting world oozing napalm, Thor throws Mjolnir and tells it to wreathe itself in the flames of the nearest star. Slashing Thor, Loki sneers that Mjolnir won't be able to save him, tauntingly stating that his minions are killing Thor's grandaughters even as they speak. Enraged, Thor blasts Loki point-blank with the full power of theThor-Forceto no effect. All-Father Thor recalls that it had taken himself and two past incarnations to defeat Gorr, who had been a mere mortal before his acquisition of All-Black, and that they had barely succeeded; while Loki had been born ofFrost Giantsand raised byAsgardians. As Mjolnir returns wreathed in stellar plasma, Loki mockingly asks if Thor thinks a little fire will stop him. Replying that he knows it won't, Thor says that he hopes it at least hurts and slams the fire into a nearby pool of napalm. A massive chunk of the planet explodes, ejecting Thor and Loki into space; Thor recalling his lifelong enmity with his brother and dashed hopes that he would someday be redeemed, begrudgingly accepting that if he and his granddaughters are to live then his brother must die.\nIn the Halls of All-Knowing, Atli and Frigg continue to fight against Loki's necro-ravens as Ellisiv senses Asgard's destruction. Frigg snaps that they need to return now, but Shadrak says they were too late even before they arrived. Frigg refuses to accept this, snapping that Shadrak is clearly insane - to which he agrees; but Ellisiv snaps that this isn't about Asgard, themselves, or even Thor, but about stopping Loki and saving what's left of the universe. Atli lashes out as several necro-ravens amalgamate into a massive corvid that tries to eat her, regrouping with her sisters and Shadrak. Pulling out a shard of the Bifrost, Ellisiv asks Shadrak where they should go, but Shadrak steps away and says that he's not going with them. Quipping that a librarian never leaves his books, Shadrak gives Ellisiv theSaga of the God Butcherand tells her to end it by going back to the beginning. Remarking that he's finally remembered what he's the god of, Shadrak conjures a bomb and bids the Goddesses of Thunder farewell. As they teleport using the shard of the Bifrost, Shadrak detonates his bomb and obliterates Omnipotence City.\nAcross the cosmos, Thor senses the destruction of Omnipotence City, Loki gleefully remarking that this is the end of the gods and the lie that is eternal life. Disembowling Thor with All-Black, Loki boasts that he is the bringer of the fundamental truth that nothing lasts forever, except for him. Thor realizes that Loki is, for once, speaking the truth and that all his eons of struggle have been in vain, as nothing is left except for hatred and petty sibling jealousy. Grabbing Thor, Loki mockingly tells his brother that he killed Odin by whispering every single one of his sins into the old All-Father's ear. Livid, Thor snaps that Loki is lying and that he killed Odin, putting him out of his misery when he went senile and using all of Jotunheim as a funeral pyre. Grabbing Loki, Thor snaps that Freyja died of a broken heart from Loki's backslide into evil, cursing that she'd ever believed in and loved him. Telling Loki that he regrets having done the same, Thor wraps his own intestines around Mjolnir and Loki's throat, throwing the divine hammer into the Sun. Weeping as he realizes he's become the new God of Lies for morning his brother, Thor watches in sudden horror as living abyss consumes the star and Loki bursts out, gleefully quipping that he just murdered the Sun.\nStabbing Thor with dozens of blades, Loki slams him into the surface of New Midgard and gloats that he's going to have fun slaughtering all of humanity all over again. Thor tries to recall Mjolnir from the dying Sun, but tendrils of living abyss constrain it. Unable to move, Thor prays to any gods that remain, asking them to avenge the universe. His eyes glowing yellow, Loki sneers that there will be nothing left to avenge and that he'll live so long in the empty abyss that he'll forget Thor ever existed. Loki is promptly impaled from behind by a blade of living abyss - a second figure bonded to the All-Black - as a voice scornfully berates them for squabbling while the last of the universe withers around them. To Thor's disbelief and horror, Gorr the God Butcher - back from the dead - looms over the God of Thunder and his brother, sneering that this is why he hates gods and wants to kill them all.\nSUPERSTARS JASON AARON & ESAD RIBIC CONCLUDE THEIR EPIC THOR STORY!"

Hearing thunder, he turns wondering ifKing Thorhas returned for a rematch - boasting that he is invincible now that he has fed. TheGoddesses of Thunder-FriggwieldingStormbreaker,EllisivwieldingHridgandrandFimbuldraugr, andAtliwieldingJarnbjorn- attack him, the latter two ridingToothgnasherandToothgrinder. As Galactus incredulously stares at them, Ellisiv demands to know what he's done with their grandfather, the three goddesses attacking him. Irritated, Galactus states that if they seek Thor, they can join him in the depths of space.\nInthe present,S.H.I.E.L.D.AgentRosalind SolomoncirclesRoxxon'sfloating industrial complexabove the city ofBroxton,Oklahoma; lamenting that unless the corrupt mega-corp is stopped he whole world will end up a polluted wasteland.Agent Phil Coulsonlectures her not to involve Thor and reminds her to deny culpability inThor the Avenger's technically-illegal attack on Roxxon's property. Ros grumps that he sucks at pep talks, Coulson remarking that he's even worse at firing people before asking on behalf ofDirector Hillif she's made any progress. Ros remarks that things have only gotten worse, as massive sinkholes have opened up in the middle of the city, hindering her team's efforts to evacuate. Spotting Thor standing on the roof of a house, she hangs up on Coulson and demands to know what he's doing in Broxton. Thor states that he's deliberating simply blasting Roxxon Island out of the sky. Ros berates Thor for defying a court order, but he sternly retorts that the gods have never been bound by human laws. Ros states that he's playing into Roxxon's hands by violating their injunction, and that's only making things worse for Broxton. Thor refuses to back down when the citizens of Broxton have put their faith in him and Asgard; Ros telling Thor that the time will come when they need him, but asks for the time being to put his faith in her. Thor states that he has from the moment he met her, flying away as she grumbles that he could have kissed her.\nDescending into Sinkhole Seven, Ros' flying car is crushed by a falling boulder. Climbing out of the wreckage, she gripes that Coulson is going to kill her for totalling another car, a voice answering that that's unlikely unless he beats them to it. Seeing a group ofTrolls, Ros declares that she's placing them under arrest. Sneering at this, the leader of the Trolls -Ulik- tells his cohorts to eat her if they want, and save him a thigh. As the Trolls approach, Ros tells her belt to print a cartridge of maximum-caliber bullets, loading them into her pistol and opening fire.\nIn the distant future, the Goddesses of Thunder put up a decent fight against Galactus, wounding his left hand and knocking out several teeth. Angered, he blasts Atli with the Power Cosmic, and in retaliation Frigg throws Stormbreaker into his mouth before recalling it, ripping off his lower jaw. Wounded and enraged, Galactus states that gods more powerful than them have tried to kill him and that their bones litter the stars while he burns like a million suns - activating his planet-eating machinery and unleashing a massive blast of the Power Cosmic. In the depths of space, King Thor regains consciousness - sensing the Earth being consumed by the World Eater. Realizing he is not powerful enough to fight Galactus on his own, King Thor calls Mjolnir to him and flies in the opposite direction of Earth.\nIn the present, Roxxon CEODario Aggersteps out of a car at Bill's diner as the patrons debate whether to leave. As he's told by the waitress to get out, Agger smugly informs her that the building is slated for demolition - joking that he's building a Roxxie Burger in its place. As he mocks them and their misplaced faith in Thor, thunder rumbles overhead. Exiting the diner, Agger cheerfully greets Thor and asks why he didn't bring Daredevil to serve as his legal counsil. Thor quips that while Agger has his team of overpaid lawyers, he has his hammer - daring Agger to test him if he wants to see which hits harder. Agger remarks that Thor's hubris will only bring more suffering down on Broxton, Thor acquiescing that if begging were to end the peoples' suffering he would gladly do it and asks how much it would take for Aggar to feel like a man. Remarking that he doesn't know since it's been ages since he felt like a mere man, Agger pulls out his smartphone and speaks into it, telling the person on the other end that he's ready. The ground under their feet cracks, Agger telling his frightened lawyers that if they run their entire families will be homeless by the morning. Ulik and his Trolls emerge from the ground and devour the lawyers, Agger sarcastically feigning horror as he transforms into his Minotaur form and tells Thor to start begging.\nIn the distant future, King Thor arrives at theblack holewhere he disposed ofGorr the God Butcher's dark world, finding it has been consumed byAll-Black. Diving into the living abyss, Thor takes hold of the Necrosword's hilt and bonds to the primordial symbiote in order to save the Earth.\nTHE LAST DAYS OF MIDGARD - Part Four"

The Thor fails, and another steps forward and succeeds in lifting the hammer.The eldest Thorexplains to him that he is now to become the executor ofGod's justice, as he is cheered by a hall of Thors. The young Thor, who hails from Higher Avalon, is asked by the elder to tell the story of the creation of the world. The young Thor narrates the story of how God Emperor Doom created the Earth and the universe, and how he raised up the Kingdoms of the Earth. The elder Thor explains their duty and takes the younger Thor on his first mission.\nIn the Kingdom ofUtopolis,Minister Poweris brought to a site of discovery uncovered by an \"earthquake\". The item discovered is theLife Raftof theCabal. Minister Powers orders it dug out.\nThe two Thors travel toBar Sinister, the kingdom ofBaron Sinister, whom they are to bring before court at Castle Doom, where All-Father Doom himself holds court from his throne on theWorld Tree. Sinister is brought before a court of Doom and his Sheriff of Agamatto;Doctor Strange, attended by various other Barons. Sinister has been charged by the House of Braddock, rulers of Higher Avalon, with secretly and illegally aligning himself with BaronKing Hyperionof Utopolis in opposition to Higher Avalon. Sinister dismisses the accusations as laughable and absurd, claiming to have no desire to engage in games of intrigue, and raising the obvious problem that there is an ocean between his and Hyperion's kingdoms. BaronBaron Braddockcounters with the accusation that they hired the Iron Pirates as couriers, which Sinister dismisses as lies, as well as claiming that even if they weren't, Braddock couldn't prove it. He is also accused of slander, which Sinister explains away as an innocent comment, but does not deny. He is found guilty, and sentenced to pay restitution in gold or territory. Sinister refuses however, choosing instead to exercise his right as a Baron to face his accuser in the arena. Sinister goads the Baron's younger brotherBrian Braddockinto accepting the duel.\nBrian initially appears to make quick work of Sinister, decapitating him almost instantly. As Brian is boasting to the crowd however, Sinister, who is still alive, attacks him from behind and defeats him. Before Sinister can deal the killing blow, Doom himself intervenes. Doom spares Brian's life to interrogate him, telling him that Higher Avalon is long rumored to be the most favorable conduit for reaching the Silent Chambers, a place where \"heretics and thieves\" work to depose Doom. Doom claims that when faced with confessions, and those captured have cried out the name \"Braddock.\" He demands to know the location of this hidden citadel, but when Brian denies any knowledge of it, Doom declares him useless and orders that his eyes, tongue, hands and feet are to be removed. Baron James intervenes, claiming that it was not his brother those captured had spoken of, but he himself. Enraged at betrayal by one of his barons, he orders the entire House of Braddock to be publicly executed. His romantic partnerSusan von Doomimplores him to be merciful however, and Doom instead banishes James beyond the Shield and allows his brother Brian to take up his place as Baron.\nAs the trial concludes,Valeriaasks to speak to Doctor Strange in private, away from her father and his people. She brings Minister Powers findings to his attention, telling him that carbon dating on the discovered object puts its age somewhere well before the believed time of the creation of the Earth. Strange invokes a quarantine of the area where it was discovered.\nThe two Thors escort Baron James to the Shield, where he is equipped with basic armour and a sword, and tossed to the Deadlands, a land populated by the undead. As they return to Castle Doom, they are tasked by Strange to travel to Utopolis and enforce the quarantine he ordered on the strange object Minister Powers discovered. The elder Thor orders the item isolated, but one of theMoloiddiggers is unable to resist the temptation to push a button, which opens the craft. The elder Thor orders everyone to flee, as he is pierced by a spear. He tells the young Thor to go tell Sheriff Strange that they found death there. Before he can muster up the power to fight back, he is hit with an axe in the chest, and is killed when his head is impaled by another spear.

Then Jessica looks up to seeAtlaswreckingAvengers Tower.\nThe Avengers,Secret Avengers, and those New Avengers who are able to fight rush to the scene, but they find the damage minimal and the building empty. Atlas' attack was merely a decoy to give Williams time to call a press conference. When the Avengers arrive, they find him holding forth on the steps of theNew York Public Library, telling a large crowd that the Avengers have been operating in secret for too long and must be held to account. He threatens to make all their crimes public unless they disband. The Avengers order him to stand down, but he is defiant: \"I don't acknowledge your authority over me!...

Williams insists that he is acting of his own free will and remains steadfast in his claim that the Avengers must disband before more people are hurt. He also adds something new: his realization thatWanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, created him; that he probably isn't even real. Appealing to their friendship, Williams tries to extract a promise from Beast to shut the Avengers down when he realizes that Williams is in the right, but a distressed Beast walks away.\nVarious news programs and talking heads are buzzing about the Avengers' lack of transparency and stonewalling tactics.

As they charge towards him, Galactus attempts to stomp on them; asking if he correctly heard them say they're ready to die. As he prepares to blast them with the Power Cosmic, thunder rumbles and bolts of black lightning split the sky, Galactus irately turning to face the oncoming King Thor. The Goddesses of Thunder react first with joy and then horror as King Thor dives through the sky, holding Mjolnir in his left hand; and covered inblack armor formed of living darkness, with his right arm transformed into a sword made of the same. Letting out a furious battle-cry, the Necro-Thor plunges through Galactus' torso, knocking him to the ground.\nInthe present,Thor the Avenger- restrained by several Trolls - states that the they will be imprisoned inNastrond Prisonfor invading Midgard, provided he sees fit not to execute them all on the spot.Ulikpunches Thor in the chest with a knuckleduster, saying Trolls make their homes wherever they please before disparaginghis mother. Minotaur interrupts, saying the Trolls have had their fun but that it's now time to get down to business. Dropping into a crouch, Minotaur rams Thor and ploughs him into Bill's Diner, destroying it. Exiting the wreckage, Minotaur tells the Trolls to murder and pillage as they please, and to raze Broxton to the ground. Thor chokes out that Aggar is a monster, Minotaur mockingly asking him what he means. Thor explains that - given that Aggar fed his lawyers to Trolls and transformed into a bull-headed beast with strength rivallingthe Hulk's... he's now free to cut loose. Thor punches Minotaur hard enough to send him flying from the heart of Broxton to its outskirts, summoning Mjolnir to his hand before turning to confront Ulik and the other Trolls. As Thor and Ulik clash, the Troll-King sneers thatwaris coming to the Nine Realms and that what's happened to Broxton is but a small taste of what awaits.\nIn the distant future, Necro-Thor declares his intent to kill Galactus, who is shocked that Thor would go so far as to take up the dark blade for the sake of a dying world. Roaring that Galactus should've found something else to eat, Necro-Thor blasts him with black lightning and knocks him over again.\nIn the past, Ulik's Trolls surround a group of humans, who respond belligerently to the casual remarks about eating them. Before the Trolls can make good on their threats,S.H.I.E.L.D.AgentRoz Solomonopens fire and kills them. Contacting her, AgentPhil Coulsonasks why she was radio-silent for hours, Roz responding that since they last spoke she's killed thirteen Trolls - and had never taken a life before that point. Coulson tells her that backup is on its way, advising her to fall back due to her lack of combat experience, but Roz ignores him and continues to fight.\nAs Thor trades blows with Ulik, Minotaur returns to the fight and rams him from behind, goring him with one of his horns. As Ulik pummels Thor, Minotaur states that he won't kill Thor since he wants the god of thunder to bear witness to Roxxon using up all the resources on Earth and leaving it a barren wasteland. Thor stuns them both out with Mjolnir, before picking them both up and smashing them into a Roxxon building. Thor then routes the Trolls before they can kill Roz and dives into the fissure they're climbing out of.\nIn the distant future, Galactus refuses to yield and dares Thor to damn all of the cosmos by killing him. Frigg and Ellisiv urge Thor to not give in the All-Black's deicidal hunger, but Atli shouts that he looks badass in black and urges him to kill Galactus. Stating that he would not have Galactus leave Earth hungry, Necro-Thor tells him to open wide before blasting him with the All-Black-infused Thor-Force, vowing to defend the Earth until the last embers of existence fade into the Void. Galactus and Thor both collapse, seemingly deceased.\nThe following day, Thor the Avenger and his fellow Asgardians arrest the remaining Troll warriors, though Ulik escaped. Dario Agger claims that he was attacked by the Trolls, who killed his lawyers and stole his clothes. Roz informs Thor that none of the townsfolk were killed, calling it a miracle; but Thor disagrees, weeping - the ground where his tears fall being left utterly barren. All-Father Thor regains consciousness, divested of All-Black, and watches as drops of his divine blood fall to the ground. To his and the Goddesses of Thunder's astonishment, plant-life springs forth where his blood fell, turning the area into a field.\nTHE LAST DAYS OF MIDGARD Part Five\n• Thor’s war to save the earth comes to its epic conclusion.

King Thor replies that they're still several billion light-years away, but that they've got a good solar wind at their backs and plenty of ale. Thor the Avenger states that they've drank all the ale, King Thor irritably telling him to do something useful like polishing his hammer or growing a beard before he throws his younger self overboard, recommending he sleep while he can.\nOn Gorr's dark world, Young Thor toils alongside thousands of other enslaved gods, overseen by whip-wieldingBlack Berserkers. Fed up with being lashed, Thor flattens one with a boulder and challenges the Black Berserkers to a fight, but is accosted bya blonde goddesswho punches him in the face and tells him to get back to work. When Young Thor calls her a coward for not fighting back, agoddess with short red hairand a fiery temper eagerly declares her intent to castrate him before being stopped bya third goddesswith medium-length orange hair, who amorously remarks that Young Thor is too handsome to maim and expresses the desire to sleep with him. The blonde goddess tells her sisters to stand down before telling Young Thor to get back in line, pointing out that every time he acts out Gorr has another god crucified. She angrily informs Young Thor that some of her friends have died because of his braggadocio, causing him to back down. The red-haired goddess compalins about not getting to mutilate him, while her orange-haired sister notes there's something familiar about Young Thor that she can't quite place. Young Thor asks what they are the goddesses of, only for the blonde goddess to reply that they're just slaves as she and her sisters depart. Young Thor angrily curses them under his breath, not realizing he just methis future grandchildren.\nAs they labor day and night, Young Thor notices that many of the enslaved gods are so utterly broken they no longer remember who they are. Young Thor wonders what it is they're building,a child of Gorr's speciessmugly informing him it's a bomb intended to kill all the gods. Incredulous, Young Thor asks the child if he really thinks the universe will be better without deities, and the child replies that it will without the fear of eternal damnation or lust for eternal reward, or hatred between rival religions. Young Thor asks the child if that is what Gorr has taught him, the child stating that he is Gorr's son Agar. Young Thor disparages Gorr as a butcher and a madman, Agar countering thatThor's own fatherwas a god of war. Stating both their fathers can go to Hel, Young Thor tells Agar to take any family he has and flee the planet, and that Gorr will die for his crimes - preferably by his hands. Extendingtendrils of living darknessto choke Young Thor, Agar coldly tells him to never speak ill of Gorr in his presence again, dismissing him as a jealous god and proclaiming Gorr to be a great man. Ripping the tendrils away, Young Thor snaps that Gorr isn't a man anymore, but Agar tells him to get back to work before he has him crucified. Gorr watches with a cold smile as Agar proclaims that the gods of the universe will soon be forgotten, but that the name of Gorr the Redeemer will live on forever.\nAs King Thor sleeps, Thor the Avenger steers Skidbladnir - using his divine storm-powers to push the longship to faster-than-light speeds. With no-one to talk to except Mjolnir, Thor wrestles with his growing doubts and worry that Gorr's misotheistic rants contain a grain of truth: that the gods - himself included - are unworthy.\nOn Gorr's dark world, the god-slaves are permitted to rest every seventh day in mockery of the Abrahamic religions. Young Thor comes across the blonde goddess addressing a gathering of gods, stating that they have three days at most before Gorr's bomb is finished. The gods begin to debate the best course of action, Young Thor speaking up and volunteering even when the blonde goddess - Frigg - states it would be a suicide mission. Thor introduces himself, the orange-haired goddess - Ellisiv - horrified that she'd been fantasizing about her own grandfather; and the red-haired goddess - Atli - dismissing him as inferior to All-Father Thor. When asked if he could conjure a storm, Thor admits his powers are failing him and is told that's the case for all of the gods present. Frigg states they'll need to gather all the weapons they can to destroy the Godbomb, Thor asking how she plans to pull that off when it's the size of a moon. Frigg reveals they've managed to steal unstable matter from the cores of dead stars they were tasked with mining and fashion it into a bomb of their own. As the gods debate how to overcome Gorr's Black Berserkers, Thor steals the star-matter bomb just as it's decided one of them will have to sacrifice themselves to distract the Black Berserkers while the others carry out the attack. Cursing her future grandfather's recklessness, Frigg rallies the other gods and rushes after him; Thor praying to the cosmos for one last storm. Clouds gather overhead as the Black Berserkers swarm Thor, a deluge of flames and red lightning falling from the sky instead of water - to Atli's jealousy. With every intent to sacrifice himself - his one regret not having been able to lift Mjolnir - Thor hurls the star-matter bomb at the Godbomb.\nIn deep space, King Thor asks Thor the Avenger if he felt a sudden surge of power. Thor the Avenger states that there was a powerful but brief storm in the distance, and now all he feels is pain and fire in his gut. As they near Gorr's dark world, the pass through the corpses of countless dead gods cast into orbit, now nothing more than food for starsharks and other intersteller predators. Sensing something, All-Father Thor tells Thor the Avenger to ready his hammer before a figure leaps onboard, grabs a passing starshark, and bashes Thor the Avenger upside the head with it. All-Father Thor blasts the starshark to pieces as Thor the Avenger picks himself up, and the two gods of thunder turn to confront their aggressor - Young Thor. As Young Thor mistakes him for Odin and calls his future selves \"grizzled old bastards,\" All-Father Thor despairs at the appearance of an even more hot-tempered and reckless past version of himself, asking Thor the Avenger if he's certain there's no ale left.\nThor the Avenger explains the situation to his past self, Young Thor cursing the existence of time travel and disparaging Thor the Avenger as an old man. Told to arm himself, he tentatively reaches for Thor the Avenger's Mjolnir, only for his future self grab the divine hammer just before he can touch it. As Young Thor hefts a two-handed war-hammer without a worthiness enchantment, King Thor asks if the planet they're approaching is Gorr's world. Young Thor answers affirmatively, then notices that the star-matter bomb failed to so much as scratch the Godbomb - which is visible from orbit. Furious, Young Thor shouts out a challenge to Gorr, Thor the Avenger telling him to shut his mouth and let their hammers do the talking.\nGODBOMB Part Two of Five"

One of them awakens, asking if he's ready for another round of love-making, but Thor mutters that Gorr isn't dead. Confused and alarmed, the woman grabs her sword and wraps herself in a sheet, rebuking Thor when he tells her not to worry and demanding to know whose blood they're going to spill. GrabbingJarnbjorn, Thor checks outside and is relieved to see nothing is there, scolding himself for being so frightened even eight days after killing the God Butcher. Turning to the shieldmaiden, Thor states he doesn't want to dream any longer that night and asks her to keep him awake until the sun rises. Smiling flirtatiously, the shieldmaiden drops her sword and sheet and Thor embraces her - neither noticing acreature made of living darknesswatching from the rafters.\nInthe distant future, Thor the Avenger asksKing Thorif they're the same person. King Thor replies that he is Thor the Avenger's older, wiser, and more exquisitely-bearded future self; but refuses to say what became of his missing eye or why he has an arm of the Destroyer as a prosthetic, grumping that Thor the Avenger's acting like he's never time-travelled before. As King Thor leads his younger self through the barren ruins of Asgard, Thor the Avenger asks what happened. King Thor takes him toHlidskjalf, Thor the Avenger realizing that this means his older self is theAll-Father. King Thor asks if his younger self is anAvenger, aGuardian of the Galaxy, or if he's moved to the Sun and become acosmic god-copyet. Confused by that last point, Thor the Avenger asks King Thor if he remembers having this conversation already given they're the same person. King Thor retorts that he's so old he barely remembers how to dress himself, reminding his past self that there are all sorts of annoying rules governing time travel. Both Thors agree they hate time travel, Thor the Avenger asking King Thor what he's looking for. King Thor remarks that for the first time in 900 years the Black Berserkers besieging Asgard are gone and that maybe they have a chance against Gorr. Getting up, King Thor tells his younger self to prepare for war; chastizing Thor the Avenger's reckless eagerness to charge into battle. After King Thor teleports away, Thor the Avenger is horrified at his future self being the spitting image of Odin both in appearance and personality, praying that he's in a preventable alternate future timeline liketheonestheX-Menkeep going on about. Following King Thor's directions, Thor the Avenger enters a chamber in the east wing and comes across Asgard's mead chamber - deciding to help himself to alleviate the stress.\nIn the 9th century, Young Thor is tackled by a pair of Black Berserkers, slashing one with Jarnbjorn and shouting that he knew Gorr wasn't dead. As he demands to know where the one-armed God-Butcher is, one of the Black Berserkers uses a chunk of the Pool of Forevers' control crystals to open a portal through time and space beneath Young Thor. Surfacing in the Pool of Forevers and seeing Gorr standing over him, Young Thor prepares for battle but is promptly grabbed by a massive tendril of living darkness, slamming him around the chamber. Restraining Young Thor, Gorr declares his intent to pick up where they left off in the cave and resumes torturing him.\nBidding farewell to his fallen sons and vowing to savehis grandchildrenif they still live, King Thor makes his way to Asgard's armory and calls out to his younger self, delivering a rousing battle-speech. Thor the Avenger arrives carrying a barrel of ale, remarking that he's ready but that King Thor hasn't informed him what happened to Asgard. King Thor replies that Gorr arrived 900 years ago with a horde of Black Berserkers, killing or capturing all of the Asgardians until only he was left. King Thor states that Gorr then claimed a dead, blackened planet at the edge of space as his base of operations, enslaving countless gods and buildingsomething; but that all he could do was watch until his past self arrived. Stating that Thor the Avenger's arrival has rekindled his fighting spirit, King Thor thanks his beardless, dim-witted past self for making him feel like a god again. When King Thor states he can again feel theThor-Forcesurging through him again, Thor the Avenger asks if he's referring to the Odin-Force; his future self retorting that has had the Power of the All-Father for longer than Odin did, and renamed it ten thousand years ago. BoardingSkithblathnir- the most-vaunted Asgardian longship - the two Thors vow to stand together in battle against Gorr and his Black Berserkers, setting sail into the abyss of space.\nOn his blackened world, Gorr tosses Young Thor's limp body to his Black Berserkers, telling them to put him with the other slaves assigned to the building crew, and to make sure he drives in the last nail.\nIn theHalls of All-Knowing, theLord Librarianinterrogates and disparages a God of the Watch, who informs him that the Communications Division has failed to get in touch withChronux.

Once the dusk had fallen, Doom tasked Valeria to use the resources of the Foundation to find the interlopers who had been scattered across the world, denying to provide any more information than that. Once Valeria left, Doom opened a portal below a Molecule Man statue in his garden, walking down a set of stairs to meet the Molecule Man and informed him of Strange's death. The Molecule Man made remembrance of the day when he, Doom and Strange confronted the Beyonders. During Doom's mission to thwart the Beyonders' plan by killing Molecule Men across the Multiverse, they had realized that it was not going to work; the Beyonders had built the Molecule Men too well and killing them early was still causing the Multiverse to die. Changing the plan, they began to capture the Molecule Men, and when they confronted the Beyonders, Doom unleashed the countless Molecule Men he had gathered to kill them; the Molecule Man acted as a conduit to steal the Beyonders' power and give it to Doom. The Molecule Man finished his chat with Doom by informing him that with Strange's death, he had most likely started an unraveling that could take everyone down.\nBack on Doomstadt, the Department of Science of the Foundation set out to find the interlopers. Thor had infiltrated the Thor Corps, Black Panther and Namor found themselves in Egyptia, Captain Marvel had been captured by the forces of Bar Sinister, Black Swan had appeared in Doomstadt, Thanos was teleported to the other side of the Shield, and both Star-Lord and Miles Morales had ended up in the Kingdom of Manhattan."

Bitterly noting that the gods never provided aid when they were needed most, Gorr travels back in time 14 billion years, tothe Void before the universe began. Coming across an infantelder godhaving fun sculpting grotesquely misshapen entities, Gorr looks on in disgust and growing rage before manifestinga suit of armour and swordofliving darkness- vowing to make his dream of a godless age a reality as he lunges.\nIn the present day, Gorr emerges from the Pool of Forevers carrying the baby elder god's heart, to the horror of the last surviving time god of Chronux. As Gorr remarks that all he needs now is a couple of moons, some centuries to himself, and lots and lots slaves; he is suddenly blasted by a bolt of lightning and smashed in the face by Mjolnir as Thor arrives.\nIn the 9th century, Gorr has finally succeeded in breaking Thor after seventeen days of torture. Genuinely impressed, Gorr asks Thor if any other Asgardians would have suffered as much for his sake, telling him that the pain will stop when he is told the way to Asgard. Gorr offers to start his genocide with Thor's enemies, asking if there'sa siblingora parentwho he hates; but before Thor can respond a group of Viking warriors storm the cave, catching Gorr off-guard.\nIn the present, Thor smashes a group ofBlack Berserkerswith Mjolnir, deriding them as empty husks and challenging Gorr to face him in single combat. Gorr sneers that Thor has grown since they last met, manifesting his dark armor; and states that his Black Berserkers are a part of him and have minds of their own - for instance, the ones who razed the Halls of All-Knowing having acted mostly autonomously, though Gorr speculates they may have been guided by his subconscious desire for Thor to witness his triumph.\nIn the past, Gorr rails against the berserkers attacking him, protesting that he's come to liberate them from the tyranny of the gods - which only further enrages the devout Norsemen. As one of them tries to free Thor, Gorr snares him with tendrils of darkness, but when he begins to launch into a misotheistic rant the Vikings tell him to shut up. Livid, Gorr decides that if they want to die for their god then he'll grant their wish.\nIn the present, Thor furiously asks Gorr if he remembers the faces of the Vikings he killed, Gorr stating that he does. Remarking that he'd never seen anyone so gleefully willing to sacrifice themselves before, Gorr states that Thor's Vikings taught him two important lessons: that mortals fear a world without gods more than death; and that he could no longer carry out his deicide alone. Overwhelming Thor, Gorr states that for two-thousand years he slaughtered every immortal being he came across, but that Thor brought him out of the darkness and and showed him a whole new way to carry out his mission.\nIn the past, Thor - enraged by the sight of Gorr killing his followers, frees himself from the chains of darkness and grabsJarnbjorn- catching Gorr off-guard and lopping off his right arm. In the present, Gorr remarks that Thor assumed he had killed him, but that instead he saved him - and to repay that debt Gorr says he is going to kill Thor last of all. Turning to the last time god, Gorr asks if he is done; and when the time god says he programmed the pool to Gorr's specifications the God Butcher kills him. Enraged, Thor swears that no more gods will die, but Gorr retorts thatallgods across all of time and space will die. Retrieving the infant elder god's heart, Gorr descends into the Pool of Forevers, telling Thor to stay alive as long as he can so that they can meet again. The Black Berserkers set about destroying the Pool of Forevers, but Thor breaks free and plunges into it - being transportedthousands of years into the future. Seeinga one-eyed old man with white hair, a beard, and a prosthetic armwielding Mjolnir, Thor assumes he is looking at his father. The old man irritibly snaps that he's not Odin, dismissing Thor as a beardless whelp but telling him to ready Mjolnir and show him that he's all he remembers the God of Thunder to be.\nIn the past, Thor summons a massive bolt of lightning that blasts Gorr and seemingly vaporizes him. The surviving Vikings cheer, but Thor angrily tells them to never speak of this day ever again.\nIn the future, Thor the Avenger and All-Father Thor push the Black Berserkers back, the latter noting that Gorr is recalling them. Thor asks where Gorr is, saying that he was right behind him; but the elderly Asgardian sneers that Thor is even stupider than he remembers - saying that Gorr has already been there for 900 years and has been very busy.\nThe living darkness comprising the Black Berserkers streaks through space and is reabsorbed into Gorr's armor, the God-Butcher noting the past Thor's arrival before remarking that there can never be too many Thors and stating that he arrived just in time. Looking overhis masterpieceand an army of enslaved gods toiling below, Gorr states that the day of his triumph is imminent.\nContinues inThor: God of Thunder#6...\n• The shocking finale of our opening salvo…!"

After subduing T'Challa, he realizes the fight had merely been a distraction. Doom quickly teleported to the Molecule Man's statue and delved into his chamber, and tried to destroy Richards with a snap of his fingers. He was surprised when his power did not work, and the Molecule Man asked him if he had brought him something to eat, to which Doom replied he did not. Thus, Owen claimed that Reed and Doom were in equal ground. Mister Fantastic and Doom engage in a furious combat, with Reed claiming that even though Victor did good, he could have done better, and because he was too afraid of losing Battleworld, he held it too tight. Doom accused Richards of believing he could have done better had he had Doom's power, and when Reed conceded he did, so did Doom.

Gorr dismisses it as the antics of the gods and tells her that hisprojectis proceeding as planned. \"Arra\" wonders what will come after all the gods are dead and he's freed of his vengeful crusade, noting Gorr's melancholy reaction and telling him not to say he'll be ready to die. Gorr tells her he'll be ready to live and tries to coax her back into sleeping, but is interrupted by the arrival ofThor the Avenger, Young Thor, andAll-Father Thoron an Asgardian longship.\nAll-Father Thor tells his past selves to follow his lead, but the headstrong Young Thor disregards both him and Thor the Avenger, who notes the entire planet seems to be formed from Gorr's weapon and that they should keep to the skies. All-Father Thor reminds him that Young Thor is not yet worthy of Mjolnir and thus can't fly, but Young Thor arrogantly boasts that he's taken on Gorr twice and won. Thor the Avenger reminds his reckless younger self that he was also captured by Gorr twice, but their dispute is interrupted when Gorr himself arrives, having manifested bat-like wings from his symbiote-armor. Gorr snarls that they should have brought more Thors, prompting Young Thor to mock his older counterparts for their caution and leap out of the longboat. All-Father Thor follows suit, calling his younger selves idiot children who have yet to learn what it means to be a king. Thor the Avenger pauses to address Mjolnir, asking it for the strength to win the day, before leaping into battle himself. Gorr manifests a swarm ofBlack Berserkers, thanking them for giving him one last opportunity to live up to his moniker of \"God-Butcher\". All-Father Thor blasts Gorr with the full force of hisdivine power, near-instantaneously smashing him into a moon lightyears away. As the Thors fly towards him, Gorr rips up massive chunks of the moon and throws them into space; ordering the Black Berserkers to slaughter all the gods he'd enslaved to give him more power. The monsters slaughter and consume the gods, merging together into a titanic Black Berserker that snakes across the cosmos to devour Thor the Avenger and All-Father Thor. Young Thor attacks mounted on a Starshark, but Gorr stabs it with an arm-blade and blasts it with a beam of purple energy. Young Thor takes advantage of the distraction to bash Gorr with his warhammer, sending him crashing to the surface of another moon.\nInside the Black Leviathan, Thor the Avenger compares it toJormungandand laments being trapped inside it. All-Father Thor forces the Black Berserker's mouth open so that Thor the Avenger can escape and join Young Thor in battle, passing his badly wounded younger self. Arriving on the moon, he is confronted by Gorr - who has manifested four extra arms tipped with blades. Despite All-Black slowly infecting him with every blow Gorr lands, Thor resolves to give his all - the moon shattering from the force of their blows. Noticing lava emerging from the planetoid that Gorr had been ripping chunks out of, Thor smashes into the emerging volcano and seals it - saving the planet's sentient inhabitants. As Thor the Avenger flies into space, Gorr compares him to his past and future selves, noting that he could never quite understand what he was fighting for until now. Gorr sneers that Thor fights because he knows that the gods are unworthy of the praise they recieve, because deep down he knows that Gorr is right. All-Father Thor destroys the Black Leviathan using the Thor-Force, and he and Young Thor rejoin Thor the Avenger in battle. When Gorr withstands a point-blank blast of the Thor-Force, the three Thors tackle him and plunge him into the core of a nearby star. Across the universe, dark omens occur as the All-Black symbiote turns the star jet-black.\nOn Gorr's artificial planet, it begins to rain blood and three Asgardian hammers plunge from the sky. Tossing the unconscious bodies of the three Thors to the ground, Gorr the God-Butcher proclaims his victory and tells his remaining slaves to ready the Godbomb.\nGODBOMB Part Three of Five"

As Frigg snaps that the Age of the Gods is over, Ellisiv retorts that Thor didn't let it end and kneels in the dirt. Frigg incredulously asks what she's doing, and Ellisiv retorts that she's praying. As Frigg snaps that gods don't pray, Atli angrily breaks up the argument by slamming Jarnbjorn into the ground and joins her sister in prayer. Frigg reluctantly joins them and the three sisters pray to Thor, themselves, and any deities that are left, conjuring a storm that restores the garden to life. A voice speaks Thor's name and a towering green-skinned god with thorny spines rises out of the ground, remarking that he remembers Thor from long ago. Ellisiv asks who the strange god is, and he replies that he is theRose Fatherof Indigarr.\nIn the present, the Rose Father introduces himself and the other replacementSky Lords of Indigarr- theMeat Mother,Our Lady of Comets, theChoir, and thePrince of Soot- to Gorr, declaring them Gorr's true legacy. Incredulous and livid, Gorr asks how they dare call themselves his legacy; the Prince of Soot blasting him with a torrent of ashes and retorting that after Gorr's deicidal crusade he and the others were left without worlds of their own until Thor brought them into the past and Indigarr; the Meat Mother smashing Gorr with a fleshy tendril and Our Lady of Comets shooting Gorr with a meteor arrow as they concur. Grabbing Gorr in a headlock with his thorny arms, the Rose Father saying that he and the others made Indigarr into a paradise all thanks to Thor, the Choir singing praises to Gorr the Redeemer, the Savior of Gods. Screaming in rage, Gorr frees himself using All-Black and furiously swears to finish what he started, but Frigg and Ellisiv blast him with lightning and say that he couldn't kill them even with theGodbomb. As Ellisiv snaps that Gorr's all out of bombs, Atli says that they have one - herself. As her sisters restrain Gorr with lightning, Atli decapitates him with Jarnbjorn, picking up his severed head and sneering that this time she'll make sure he stays dead by immolating his corpse in a star, then throw that star into another star.\nFrigg interrupts her tirade by saying they need to find Thor and that All-Black looks bigger than ever, Ellisiv interrupting by asking where the stars have gone. Gorr's severed head replies that he ate them, revealing that his resurrected body was a construct formed by All-Black, saying that he no longer has any need of flesh and that his new body has been busy feeding on the ruins ofthe universeand is now all around them. As Gorr declares the beginning of the Age of All-Black, Thor bursts from the primordial symbiote astride Death Mouth, brandishing theOdinswordandMjolnir. Thor tells his granddaughters to summon as much lightning and thunder as they can, and to find Loki before it's too late.Toothgnasherfishes Loki out of All-Black, the God of Lies joking that Thor smells more like a goat than usual. Frigg snaps that this means they don't have to save him themselves, Loki greeting his nieces and asking if they're not still mad about him siccing the \"Necro-Ravens\" on them. Frigg snaps at him to shut up and that the only reason he's still alive is that Thor wants him as such -  Atli quipping that there's hardly anything left for her to chop up. Ellisiv slams theSaga of the God Butcherdown on Loki's chest, telling him that the entire universe has been infected and that, one way or the other, this is the end. As she tells him they need to finish their own sagas, Loki opens the book and quips that he always preferred an ending with lots of tears and bloodshed.\nThor is shocked to see the Sky Lords of Indigarr are still alive, the Rose Father replying that Thor's not the only god to have survived the countless eons, the Prince of Soot adding that they've been sleeping and Meat Mother that they've been dreaming of revenge against Gorr. Thor thanks them for saving him, recalling the little girl who'd prayed for rain eons ago - telling them it's time for them to earn the right to call themselves gods or die trying.\nOnMidgard, a man shivers and wonders why it's so cold and dark. As he asks what happened to thesun, another man tells him to just keep praying to Thor and they'll be saved.\nAstride Death Mouth, Thor blasts All-Black with lightning; the ancient symbiote retaliating with maelstroms of living darkness,Berserker-Moonsthat attempt to devour the gods, and black-flamed meteors. As Thor despairs that he now has to destroy the very universe he fought to save, All-Black manifests Gorr's face on the surface of a blackened planet and welcomes him to the \"Necroverse.\"\nTHE RETURN OF THE GOD BUTCHER!"

As they carry him past the crypt containing the bodies of his parents, wives, and children, he gladly awaits death - even if it means being condemned to Hel. He laments that Asgard has fallen into ruin, a testament to his failure as a king, and that he lived longer than he ever should have. In his despair, All-Father Thor expresses relief that there will be no more Ragnaroks to reincarnate him or the other gods, and that his death will be the end. Instead of killing him, however, the Black Berserkers deposit him in his throne and walk away - Gorr's way of denying Thor his long-awaited death. Thor curses after the monsters, trying to goad them into returning and putting him out of his misery, but they ignore him.\nInthe present,Thor the Avengerconverses withShadrak, the last surviving member of the gods of the Oghogho. Stating that he was the god of wine and waterfalls, he laments that his brethren were slaughtered by the Black Berserkers, Gorr cutting out his eyelids to force him to watch. Shadrak notes that witnessing Gorr's genocide drove him insane, and that he barely managed to escape, making his way to Earth and hiding in the one spot Gorr would never look. Thor asks Shadrak where Gorr is, but Shadrak replies that there is no need to look - Gorr will eventually come for them all - saving Thor for last. Shadrak notes that Gorr'seldritch swordis the key to his immortality and other powers, feeding off his insatiable rage and hatred for the gods. Thor asks Shadrak if he knows where Gorr was headed next, and Shadrak recalls he mentionedChronuxbut refuses to say any more. Thor promises to protect Shadrak if he helps vanquish Gorr, taking him toOmnipotence City. Returning to theHalls of All-Knowing, Thor finds theLord Librarianmutilated - a trio of Black Berserkers in the process of razing the divine library.\nIn the year 493 AD, Young Thor awakens to find himself bound in chains ofliving darkness, the God Butcher declaring his intent to torture Thor until he reveals the names and locations of all of Earth's gods - especially his friends and family. Thor furiously tells Gorr to go to Hel, the chains sprouting spikes as Gorr remarks that he once tortured and broke a god of torture in a single evening. Noting that he rarely gets to take his time anymore, given the vast number of gods in the cosmos; Gorr begins to torture Thor as he remarks that one god had the audacity of asking if he was a deity himself, saying it took nine days to find his breaking point - as his flesh was made of stone - and wondering how long Thor will last.\nIn the present, Thor the Avenger attacks the trio of Black Berserkers, Shadrak and the Lord Librarian. Thor asks the Lord Librarian what Chronux is, and after insulting Thor's lack of intelligence he tells Thor that it's a hidden world and that the book detailing its location is currently on fire.\nIn the far future, All-Father Thor rises to his feet, vowing to die a death befitting a god of the Vikings even if it means crawling into battle. Collapsing on the stairs, Thor calls to Mjolnir - which a group of Black Berserkers are taking turns attempting to lift. The magic hammer flies to Thor, smashing everything in its path, and the All-Father rises and blasts the oncoming monsters with a wave of lightning.\nIn the present, Thor reads the scroll revealing Chronux's location just before it burns to ashes, leaving Shadrak in the Lord Librarian's care. At Chronux's Palace of Infinity, Gorr and his Black Berserkers slaughter the gods of time, draining their blood into the Pool of Forevers. Interrogating the last surviving god of time, Gorr asks if that is enough blood, threatening to kill him too if it isn't. Gorr remarks that his Black Berserkers will kill him if he doesn't return, the god of time protesting that anything could happen. Unconcerned, Gorr boasts that he knows more about the gods than anyone, demanding that he show him his magic. The god of time complains that Gorr has desecrated the Pool of Forevers, which the peaceful gods of Chronux used to travel across time and space - shepherding the past towards the present, and pruning the plethora of possible future timelines. Gorr retorts that as far as he is concerned there are two kinds of gods - those who do harm and those who do nothing at all - and that he has not decided which he hates more. Remarking that it doesn't matter as soon all gods will be dead, Gorr descends into the Pool of Forevers.\nIn the far future, All-Father Thor is impaled and defeated by the Black Berserkers, demanding they kill him. However, a blast of lightning obliterates them, revealing a bloodied Thor the Avenger, who demands to know where Gorr is.\n• Thousands of years in the future the last god king of a ruined Asgard makes his final stand against the berserker legions of the God Butcher."

Ultron, a robot created by Henry Pym, became self-aware and waged war on humanity.  The Scarlet Witch, daughter of Magneto, had lost control of her reality-altering powers.  Civil War had pitted hero against hero, cost lives, endangered civilians and property -- and changed nothing.  The Incredible Hulk, who is prone to unstoppable rampages, is still loose.  And the Dark Avengers unwittingly exposed the world to unimaginable peril simply by including Sentry in their number; which crime the Avengers compounded by killing the man.  Williams concludes that the Avengers will always harm the world more than they helped it, and that it is up to brave and forward-thinking individuals to shut them down before they can do it again.\nWilliams has assembled his own group of such individuals: the Revengers.  Comprised of D-Man, Atlas, Goliath, Century, Ethan Edwards, Anti-Venom, Devil-Slayer, and Captain Ultra, they are all former heroes who have become dissatisfied with the Avengers.  They wait outside Avengers Mansion, home to the New Avengers, until baby Danielle Cage has been taken off the grounds by her nanny, Squirrel Girl.  Then they attack.\nAtlas leads the charge, plowing through the fence and into the side of the building with enough force to make the mansion shake.  The New Avengers are at a double disadvantage: they were enjoying a lazy day off, and their attackers have done their research and know who they are.  Ms. Marvel is shocked to see Wonder Man and tries in vain to talk him down; the other New Avengers are fighting for their lives.\nVictoria Hand manages to reach her laptop and put out an alert. She is able to provide unexpected support: firstly, she has a gun, and secondly she can identify their attackers and name their weaknesses.  Atlas and Goliath are trying to bring down the building itself, though Jessica Jones and Luke Cage are doing their best to fight them.  Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man fly into each other and meet in a concussive ball of energy.\nThings look bad for the New Avengers, but they are holding their own until Atlas succeeds in breaking through the wall, bringing the mansion down on their heads and effectively ending the battle.  The Thing is able to break out; he makes a brave stand but cannot hold out against the Revengers.  They attack him from all sides, and Atlas ends it by crushing him under a giant foot.  Then Ms. Marvel falls from the sky to land, unconscious, in the midst of the rubble.\nThe Revengers are jubilant at their triumph, but Williams cuts the celebration short.  They still have work to do.  As they consider their next target, Williams gazes meaningfully at Avengers Tower."
