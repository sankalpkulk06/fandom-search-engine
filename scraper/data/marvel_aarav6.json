She also uses the portal for theJotunheim Strikeforceto return withThorfromJotunheimto theAvengers Mountain, where the allies are assembling. The headquarters is being besieged by enemies, but they are repelled afterShuriactivates the base's weaponry underBlack Panther's orders.\nMalekithhas theVenom symbiotesubdued with magical restrains inStonehenge, and begins to use magic to tame it. Recovered but still hurt,Odinsets out to rescue Freyja from Svartalfheim. Before she can destroy the Black Bifrost, Malekith emerges from a portal and wounds her with the Venom symbiote, turned intoa sword. Odin arrives, clad in theIron All-Father Armor, and they fight by side, seemingly perishing after blowing up the Black Bifrost. Thor attaches the left arm of theDestroyerto his missing arm to replace his lost prosthetic, and interruptsJane Foster's gathering of the assembled troops to declare that he will lead the fight.\nIn the ruins ofAlfheim,Queen Aelsa Featherwine of the FayandSir Ivory Honeyshotready their weapons as aBlack Bifrostportal opens. ThePunishersteps through and is confronted by the two light elves. Despite being held at point-blank gunpoint by Honeyshot, the Punisher coldly informs them that he's not a servant ofMalekithand is working forAll-Mother Freyja, offering them a chance at revenge.\nInAsgard, a dark elf calls out toBitterhandto open the Black Bifrost and send reinforcements, but is knocked out byDaredevil, who apologizes toHeimdallfor his lapse in attentiveness allowing the Bifrost to be destroyed.All-Mother Jane Fosterasks Daredevil if he was able to hold the Bifrost open long enough for their strikeforces to return home, but Daredevil says he wasn't and that they must pray to Freyja that they can still hold the Black Bifrost.\nInSvartalfheim, Freyja kills Bitterhand and claims his cursed sword, theBitterblade, becoming the Guardian of the Black Bifrost. Wreathed in dark energy and her eyes turning purple with black sclerae, Freyja states she has been given all-sight for everything dark and evil, and that she foresees more dark elves dying to her blade. Freyja ordersHulkthrough the portal, but Hulk refuses - wanting to smash more elves. Freyja tells her that she's powerful enough to hold off all of Svartalfheim, and when Hulk still refuses to leave her Freyja impatiently conjures a portal around her and teleports her away. As thousands of dark elves swarm the bridge, Freyja declares that she'll kill all of them.\nInNidavellir, Hulk reduces the dwarves to tears with a short, brusque three-sentence command to follow her and smash everything. InVanaheim,Bladerecruits theVanirto take revenge on Malekith for razing their sacred forests and defiling their temples. InNiffleheim,Ghost Riderrecruits theSpiders of Hel, quipping that he didn't think his life could get any more metal. InJotunheim, Captain America escorts his strikeforce andThorthrough a Black Bifrost portal,Spider-Mantrying to rescueWolverinefrom aFrost Giant. The strikeforce arrives inAvengers Mountainto find it under seige fromFire Demons, Frost Giants, and other monsters,T'ChallainstructingShurito unleash the power of theProgenitoron their enemies. Shuri is left awestruck as the Celestial's corpse annihilates the horde. Captain America orders for Thor to be sent to the infirmary, but his debriefing of Ghost Rider is interrupted byAll-Father Odin, who staggers into the room furiously demanding to know where his wife is.\nCarving a swath through the dark elf army, Freyja lists the ongoing travesties she's witnessing -Valkyrielying dead inManhattan,Captain Marveland theAgents of Atlasfighting Fire Goblins in China, Thor's injuries being treated, theVenom symbiotebeing tortured byMalekith, and even back through time to Malekith's own hellish childhood as a corpse-burner; stating that he will never stop fighting until he has won, but neither will they. In Manhattan,King Laufeyperches on the ruins of the Statue of Liberty and laughs, swatting fighter jets out of the sky as they attack him.\nInStonehenge, Malekith smirks and gloats to the Venom symbiote, which he has restrained with dark magic. Remarking that ancient ruins like Stonehenge are resplendent with old magic, Malekith gleefully states that Midgard is the best realm to make war in, mockingly addressing the symbiote as \"Sir Venom.\" The Venom symbiote snarls insults at Malekith, who uses his magic to torture it while lamenting its impudent arrogance. Stating that it's been bonded to a mortal host for far too long, Malekith declares his intent to use the Venom symbiote for the purpose thatKnullfirst intended: as a weapon to slay gods. As the symbiote screams, Malekith calls out to Bitterhand to send him some wine wenches so that he can drink while he bends the symbiote to his will. Hearing no reply, Malekith realizes that something has gone wrong in Svartalfheim.\nIn the Avengers Mountain, Odin berates Captain America for letting his wife go to Svartalfheim and leaving her there to die. Captain America states that those were his orders, suggesting they use the Black Bifrost portal to go to Svartalfheim and rescue her. Odin vetoes that, saying that as its Guardian Freyja would never let any of them through if she doesn't wish it. Odin states that as the All-Father, he's the only one who can make the trip, telling them to bring himGungnir.Tony StarkandScrewbeardarrive, saying they have something better than a spear: a suit of powered armor forged with dwarven magic and re-enforced with Wakandan Vibranium. Telling Stark to shut up, Odin snaps that it had better be good at killing elves.\nIn Svartalfheim, Freyja notes that the strikeforces have all made it back and now have mystical allies to aid them in retaking Midgard. She turns to destroy the Black Bifrost, but is stabbed by a dagger of living abyss - the Venom symbiote reshaped into aNecroswordin emulation ofAll-Black. Stepping through the Black Bifrost portal, Malekith says that she may be its Guardian, but that he is master of Svartalfheim and everything in it. Freyja stares down at the blade impaling her and asks Malekith what kind of foul weapon it is, Malekith responding that it is one that will kill her once and for all. Freyja prepares to slash him with the Bitterblade, but Malekith gestures and the Venom symbiote restrains her with tendrils. As Malekith orders his troops to feed Freyja to his dogs, Odin - clad in Stark's \"Iron All-Father\" armor emerges from the portal, blasting Malekith and his elves aside with beams of energy. Freyja incredulously remarks on the gaudy gold-and-red suit before refusing to leave, saying they have to destroy the Black Bifrost. Freyja tells Odin to leave her, but he refuses - saying they'll die together and be reunited in Hel. As they stand back to back, Freyja wryly remarks that they've been married for thousands of years and only now does he turn her on. Stabbing the Bitterblade into the ground, Freyja self-destructs the Black Bifrost; Malekith unable to do anything but watch in outrage and scream ineffectual orders. As the Black Bifrost explodes, Freyja and Odin lean in to kiss each other but are engulfed by the blast before they can do so.\nIn Avengers Mountain, Thor enters the armory to find the Punisher distributing firearms to the light elves. As the elves bow to him and even the Punisher gives his condolences, Thor retrieves his prosthetic arm. Jane Foster delivers a speech, stating that Odin and Freyja are presumed dead and the Black Bifrost gone, but that this means that Malekith's army can no longer be re-enforced while they have aid from across the Nine Realms. Wielding a spiked hammer andJarnbjorn, Thor bursts into the hall, interrupting Jane's speech and declaring that he will lead the battle against Malekith's forces."

After being hired on a mercenary mission to raise money, he found that he enjoyed the work. He employed a number of other armored personnel, whom he called the Iron Bots.\nHe was set to unveil a newtime displacement device, but he had to undertake munitions jobs to help finance the project. One of these was a large-scale nuke nicknamed thePlanet Buster. Terrorists found the plant where the bomb was located and attempted to detonate it. Cynthia Stark and Arno Jr. were visiting the plant during the attack. Arno suited up and killed the terrorists, but learned a retinal scan was needed to disarm the bomb. Arno went back in time to try and gain the scan from the lead man as a child, but was stopped bySpider-Man. Ironically this caused the man to grow up with an intense hatred of corporations. The bomb exploded, killing Arno's wife and child as well as many employees.[2]\nSome time later, Arno was hired by one of an elite group of rich game players called the Dicemen, and duped into fighting the time travelling bounty hunterDeath's Head. When the pair realised they had been lied to, they teamed up to go after their mutual employer, but he had already been eliminated by his own organisation, though he had left the balance of their fees behind. Death's Head gave Arno, who had been plagued by self doubt, some confidence boosting advice before leaving.[3]\nAt one point, outside of time, Immortus summoned a Legion of the Unliving to Limbo, including Iron Man 2020. Arno faced the originalIron Man. Although his armor was superior, Arno could not match Tony's skill and was outwitted.[4]\nArno was later hired bySunset Bainto destroy the rebuiltMachine Manand theMidnight Wreckers.[5]He failed and was humiliated by the automaton.[6]However it seemed he and his Iron Bots battled the Wreckers and Machine Man on multiple occasions.\nLater, he took a request by Marcus Amalgamated to rescue theowner'sdaughterfrom kidnappers. He was concerned that events in the Middle East andRussiawould impact his company due to rising oil prices, and also wanted to take advantage of a new technology Marcus promised him if he rescued Micki. However, it was a ploy. Micki was actually fleeing her father's company with data on a destructive new computer virus and the kidnappers were hired by Marcus. Arno confronted Marcus and was able to defeat him by infecting both their armors with the virus.[7]\nArno finally decided to be a hero. Unknown to him, Marcus's advisorHowardwas actually the elderly Tony Stark, pleased with his nephew's new direction.\nArno was briefly summoned by theTime-Keepersas part of their forces opposing the team of Avengers summoned from various realities byRick Jones.[8]\nArno Stark was then pulled from his own reality byX-51ofEarth-9997to be a member of hisHeralds, a group of super-humans from alternate realities. He had gathered them to warn alternate realities of the danger of theCelestialswho reproduced by impregnating worlds and manipulating the DNA of the planets' dominant species into being unwilling antibodies. Each member of the Heralds were promised their fondest wish upon completion of their mission. As payment for his agreement to join the Heralds, Stark wished to be given the opportunity to be a hero on his own terms without living in his uncle's shadow. He was teamed-up withWolverineofEarth-811,BloodstormofEarth-1298,DeathlokofEarth-7484,Spider-GirlofEarth-1122,KillravenofEarth-691, andHyperionofEarth-1121. The team was split into groups of two with Bloodstorm and Iron Man traveling toEarth-2010, a reality where everyone on Earth is avampire.\nThere they seeked out that world's version ofReed Richardsto deliver their warning of Celestial prorogation. Learning that Reed (and most of the superhero population) had fallen victim to vampirism, their information came too little too late to the damned of this world. However, their information gave Reed the resolve to drop a bomb into his Earth's core that would destroy the entire planet and wipe out all the vampires before they could take their curse to the stars.\nReturning to Earth-9997, each pair of the group having varying degrees of success with warning their realities, they arrived to find that theWatcher of Earth-9997was being judged by his alternate reality counterparts. After a brief battle against the collective ofWatchers, they were beaten when X-51 had them all teleported to the surface of their own Earths, making them guilty of the same crimes that Watcher-9997 was guilty of.\nWith their missions completed, X-51 took all the Heralds to Earth to grant them their wishes. There, Arno met theGuardians of the Galaxywho had traveled back in time fromEarth-691because they had found an ancient book that told of a point in the 21st century when all of humanity was mutated. As their Earth had been conquered by theBadoon, they sought to learn the secret in order to win their war in their own reality. Unknown to them, this was a manipulation planned byMephistoto create another divergent reality. Upon hearing of the Guardians' plight, X-51 suggested that Arno accompany them back to their own time, as in his own reality he created a bomb that caused massive mutations on his own world. Arno agreed and left with the Guardians back to their own reality.\nIt is unknown if Arno succeeded in aiding the Guardians in their quest, however since he was never seen on Earth-691, it can be presumed that the Guardians' trip to Earth-9997 created a divergence from their home reality, and whatever Arno may or may not have done for the Guardians happened in a reality different from that of Earth-691.\nHowever, for unknown reasons he was briefly imprisoned by theTime Variance Authority. He was seen byShe-Hulkwhen theTwo-Gun Kidwas released. It is entirely possible that he was plucked from reality from the TVA en route to his mission, thereby preserving Earth-691. However, the true reason why Arno was in the custody of the TVA and the fate of his mission with the Guardians remain unrevealed at this time.[9]\nAt some point in his life, Iron Man was recruited byKangto be a part of hisChronos Corps.[10]"

She then brings up the issue of Havok and Wasp destroying the tachyon dam preventing any time travelers from arriving in their time period. Magneto then arrives with a captive Wasp, announcing that Havok intends to travel back before Exitar the Executioner destroyed the Earth and save the planet. While Jean Grey and Storm consider the possibility, Cable insists that it won't work; if a physical body is sent back to when the tachyon dam was active in that era, it would shatter, destroying their entire timeline. However Cyclops wonders why his brother never reached out to them. Cable suggests that either Havok doesn't trust someone in the room or he's willing to destroy Planet X to bring back the Earth. Thus the X-Council agrees that Havok must be stopped.\nAt Havok's hideout, the X-Man is yelling at the top of his lungs at Thor for allying with Kang the Conqueror. Thor justifies that after exhausting every option, he has concluded that Kang offers the only viable option. Beast shares Havok's mistrust and states that Kang wants to conquer the Earth and he has to bring it back to do it. Kang says that he's their only hope of succeeding and that why he assembled the Chronos Corps to undo the damage the Apocalypse Twins had wrought. The plan is to extract the consciousnesses of the Avengers Unity Squad and send them back to inhabit their past selves and change the past. Havok points out that doing so would mean his daughter Katie will have never existed. Therefore, Kang takes his daughter away, claiming he will return her once the Avengers have restored the Earth. Havok freaks out at having his daughter stolen and tells Thor it'll be on him if they fail. Beast then says that they need to reassemble the Avengers but there has been no sign of Wolverine or Sunfire since landing on Planet X. Iron Man 2020 reveals that he had already found them, but getting to them will not be easy.\nOn the Celestial Ship, Wolverine and Sunfire are suffering eternal torture, though Uriel laments how she misses the years when they could scream. She then says with the tachyon dam destroyed, Kang is likely to arrive and they must prepare for him. She then tells Daken and Banshee that once the X-Men capture Havok, she wants him quietly executed and then eliminate the X-Council, framing their deaths on Kang, so she could take over. She believes that the populace won't revolt, because they only care about results and that's what will keep them happy and compliant.\nBack at Havok's hideout, Thor has left with a team to get their fellow Avengers while Havok formulates a plan to rescue Wasp. Then suddenly, Wasp returns, but Magistrate Braddock detects that she's being mind-controlled by Psylocke, forcing the X-Council and X-Force to storm the compound. Doom 2099 shoots down Storm, only to be sat upon by Blob.\nCyclops grapples with Havok, demanding to know if his brother had gone insane. Havok pleads Cyclops to trust him, revealing Kang's intent to save Earth and that Katie's in danger. Magneto interrupts him, condemning his plans, stating that it would erase the children of Planet X and starts inflicting a full-body stranglehold on Havok.\nWhile watching this from her throne, Uriel says they need to kill the Council in their sleep to frame Kang. As she states that her father will have to face an army of mutants to contend with, suddenly, Thor, Iron Man 2020, Abomination Deathlok and Venom storms the place, declaring their intent to avenge the Earth!\n• AVENGE THE EARTH Continues!\n• Kang’s Chronos Corps arrives on Planet X with a terrible offer!\n• The former members of the Uncanny Avengers must reunite to save the Earth!"

She sentSister Askaniback in time to retrieve Nathan, who was infected with theTechno-Organic Virus. In the future, technicians attempted to save Nathan using advanced technology but opted to clone him due to the severity of his condition. The clone, Stryfe, was raised by Apocalypse with the intent of becoming a vessel for his own consciousness.[10]\nStryfe's accelerated growth mirrored that of Cable, and Apocalypse instilled in him his cruel and ruthless philosophy twisting his mind. However, during a ritual to transfer Apocalypse's mind into Stryfe's body, the truth about Stryfe's origin was revealed. With the intervention of Nathan and his parents, Apocalypse was defeated, and Stryfe was spared his fate.[11]Driven mad by the revelation of his clone status, Stryfe sought power and vengeance. He allied with theNew Canaanitesand waged war against theClan Chosen, clashing repeatedly with Nathan, who was unaware of their connection. Stryfe's actions led to conflicts across time and dimensions, including encounters with Cable, the X-Men, and various mutant factions.[9]Stryfe engineered theLegacy Virus, a deadly disease targeting mutants. His actions resulted in widespread suffering and death among mutantkind.[9]Despite multiple defeats and apparent deaths, Stryfe continued to resurface, driven by his desire for revenge. He clashed with Cable, Bishop, and other heroes, orchestrating schemes to fulfill his twisted goals. Stryfe's vendetta against those who thwarted him persisted across time and alternate realities.[9]\nRecruited byKang the Conqueror, Stryfe joined theChrono Corpsto prevent theApocalypse Twins' catastrophic plans. In another twist, he struck a deal withDeadpool, leveraging the mercenary's abilities for his own ends.[12]Eventually, he returned to life through unknown means as he used a new identity,Commander Nightfount, and led theUnbreathingto attack theMarauders.[6]\nStryfe was the clone ofNathan Christopher Summers, the son ofCyclops, of theX-Men, andMadelyne Pryor-Summers, the Goblin Queen.[13]\nIn thelate 37th-early 39th century, the agedmutant,Mother Askani, alias Rachel Summers, led theAskani Cultwhich opposed ultimate ruler ofEarth; the long-lived mutant tyrantApocalypse. In need of a powerful warrior who would oppose Apocalypse, Mother Askani sentSister Askani, who sacrificed her physical body to become energy, back to the X-Men's owntime period.[14]At the time of Sister Askani's arrival, theRiders of the Stormwere attempting to kidnap the infant Nathan Summers forApocalypse.[15]After Nathan was captured and rescued byX-Factor, it was revealed that Apocalypse had infected the infant with theTechno-Organic Virusthat was rapidly spreading through his body and, if not stopped, would kill him. Sister Askani persuaded Cyclops to let her take the infant to the far future, where advanced medical science could save his life, but they would never be able to see each other again.[16]\nThe technicians who examined Nathan called for Mother Askani and informed her that the only thing keeping the child alive was some sort of protective electromagnetic field and the remnants of a mechanical entity, X-Factor'sShip. Fearing that Nathan would not survive the virus, Mother Askani had him cloned. The clone's growth was greatly accelerated until he was the same age as Nathan himself. The Askani were also able to reduce the infection of the virus in the clone. Despite their original assessments, the Askani learned that the original child would live after all. Just then, the Canaanites attacked the base and Mother Askani orderedBoakto remove the children. Boak was only able to remove one of the children when the Canaanites blasted their way into the room and seemingly killed Mother Askani. Soon after, Apocalypse himself entered the room and claimed the remaining child, whom he believed to be the original Nathan Summers that he infected, but was, in fact, the clone. Apocalypse decided to raise the infant himself, with the intention of claiming the child's body once his own current form grew too old and feeble.[17]\nApocalypse named the cloneStryfeand encouraged the boy's arrogance and cruelty as he grew into adolescence. Stryfe was watched over by Apocalypse's aide,Ch'vayre, who regarded the boy's malevolence with mixed feelings. While training in Apocalypse's citadel in Crestcoast at eight years old, Stryfe met the young Nathan, now calling himself Dayspring, who was allied with theClan Rebellion, who were attempting to destroy a virus of Apocalypse's. Surprised at their resemblance, Stryfe was defeated by Nathan and taken by Ch'vayre, to recover.[15]\nYears later, during the ritual of transferring of Apocalypse's mind into Stryfe, the tyrant learned that Stryfe was in fact the clone. Wishing to save Stryfe, Ch'vayre betrayed his master, and with the intervention of Nathan and his parentsCyclopsandJean Grey, Apocalypse was destroyed and Stryfe spared his fate.[16]\nStryfe went into hiding with Ch'vayre, whileNew Canaanitesand Scions of Apocalypse arose as the new dictatorship in Apocalypse's place. Apocalypse's rejection of him and the reveal that he was a clone drove Stryfe insane. Stryfe insisted it was Nathan, and not him, who was the clone. At some point, Stryfe found the damagedA.D.A.M. Unit Zero. Stryfe reactivated Zero, but refused to repair its speech functions, leaving Zero mute. Zero simply stated that his prime directive was to resurrect the \"High Lord\". Zero functioned as Stryfe's most trusted ally, bodyguard, and, due to its ability to teleport, transportation. Zero's programming ensured complete obedience to Stryfe. After Stryfe attempted to build an army out of blood and flesh with his powers, Zero informed him ofMadame Sanctity, the last surviving Clan Askani member. However, as Stryfe grew into a young adult, the now-elderly Ch'vayre found he could no longer oppose Stryfe's bloodthirsty desire for power. Later, Ch'vayre attempted to kill Stryfe, believing that the boy had grown mad, but Stryfe used his powers to create an illusion and torment him. Only after Ch'vayre attempted to warn the Askani of Stryfe's attack, did Stryfe fry his mind. After finding Madame Sanctity, Stryfe beamed her aboard his ship so she could tutor him and, sensing a similar psi-signature to Nathan's, Sanctity agreed. Stryfe began wearing his trademark armor and very rarely took off his mask. It was at this time that Stryfe gained the name \"The Chaos-Bringer\".[18]\nNathan, meanwhile, became the foremost military leader of the New Canaanites' opposition, theClan Chosen. During the war between these opposing forces, Stryfe and Nathan clashed repeatedly, becoming bitter enemies, even though Nathan was unaware of the true relationship between them. Stryfe also clashed with the Neo-Canaanites, a group that also wished to claim Apocalypse's power. When Stryfe's spy,Korless, infiltrated the Clan and Stryfe psychically attacked Nathan, Stryfe capturedTetherblood, one of Nathan's soldiers, and aglowing orbfrom Nathan's camp. Stryfe tortured Tetherblood to try to find out what the glowing flask was that he had obtained. After deciding to attack Nathan's camp, Stryfe was met, at gunpoint, byDomino, who had been brought to his timeline to save a sick Nathan. Ironically, Stryfe was saved, by Cable, the adult Nathan who had also been sent to save his younger self and did not want to change the timeline.[19]\nAfter decades of battle, the Clan Chosen signed a long-lasting peace treaty with the New Canaanites - but Nathan, upset by rumors that Apocalypse had survived, convinced the Clan's Askani Council that they need to fight again.\nWhen Nathan went back in time Stryfe followed, in present dayTransiahe made a deal with Commandant Constantin and President Brancoveanu. In exchange for future technology plans he got mutants he could turn into an army against Clan Chosen.[20]During one of his trips to Transian Federal House he foundAhab'sHounds, among themRachel Summerswho he believed to be Mother Askani.[21][22][23]Using Rachel and the other Hounds, his Canaanite raided and captured Clan Chosen, among the captured wasAliya Dayspring, Nathan's wife. While she did not speak of her time as a prisoner, it was hinted that she was tortured and raped by Stryfe.[24][19]\nStryfe, with the help of hisCronen, used Rachel to lure Clan Askani into a trap. With hisMutant Liberation Army, he beat a youngerNathan's teamX-Forceand captured the time-displaced Cable, bringing him back to their timeline. Eventually, X-Force beat his men with the add of those who turned on him, freed both Cable and Aliya while Rachel, after freeing herself, defeated Stryfe. To prevent any changes to the timeline Cable had Rachel erase Stryfe's memories of these events.[25]\nDuring a later attack by Stryfe's forces, a bomb was set and Aliya was fatally wounded. Aliya died inNathan's arms and asked him to take care of her son,Tyler Dayspring, unaware that Tyler had been abducted. Stryfe orderedParridan Haight's scientist,Frisco, to brainwash Tyler to reject Nathan’s beliefs and become Stryfe’s pawn. When the Clan Chosen attacked Stryfe, Tyler captured Clan memberDawnsilk, forging a neural link between them to gain Clan Chosen secrets. Nathan decided to sever the link, by shooting his son, in order to save Dawnsilk. This knocked Tyler out and further damaged his mind, but left Dawnsilk wounded as well. When Stryfe's armies were defeated by the Neo-Canaanites, Stryfe used theTinexand, with Zero, fled, traveling back in time to the late 20th century.[24]\nIn the 20th century, Stryfe and Nathan came into conflict, when Nathan, calling himself Cable, headed the mercenary team, called theWild Pack, later Six Pack, on a mission inAfghanistan. Stryfe was in charge ofMr. Tolliver's opium routes and Six Pack was contracted to take out theSovietarmored carriers that were in this route's way. After a brief battle, Stryfe and Zero teleported away. Around this time, Stryfe murdered Louis Richter, the father ofJulio Richter, during an arms deal gone bad, in-front of Julio. Later in Uruguay, Six Pack decided to go after Stryfe. After entering an underground bunker, Six Pack battled their way into a control room, whereHammerbegan to download secret information from Stryfe onto a CD. While waiting for the disk to finish downloading, Stryfe teleported behindKaneand grabbed his neck, demanding Hammer to give him the CD. Before Hammer could give Stryfe the CD, Cable shot him from behind. Stryfe grabbed the disk telekinetically and set off a self-destruct on the bunker. Cable teleported away, leaving Six Pack to fend for themselves.[26]\nLater, Stryfe gathered several young mutants like himself, who were displeased with the way mutants were treated and formed the terrorist organization, theMutant Liberation Front. Stryfe's technology and Zero's teleportation made the MLF one of the most dangerous organizations in existence, but they were opposed by Cable and theNew Mutants, whom he later reorganized intoX-Force.[27]At one point, Stryfe ordered the massacre of the NativeAmericansof theCamp VerdeReservation, the original home of X-Force memberWarpath, in order to cover up secret, illegal genetic experimentation being conducted in its vicinity.[28][29]Cable worked to stop Stryfe's plans and his terrorist group, making it the priority of his new group X-Force, and succeeded in destroying theAntarcticabase of Mutant Liberation Front.[11]\nAttempting to sow doubt and mistrust, whenWeapon Xbattled his way into Stryfe's base and defeated the MLF, Stryfe removed his mask and stated that maybe Cable was him or that neither was what they seemed.[30]\nStryfe later sent the MLF to aParisianmuseum to gather an ancient sword, but Cable stopped them, killingSumo. Later, in theYucatanjungle, just outside ofCancun, Stryfe led Kane and Cable into a trap and grabbed Kane from behind again. Stryfe took off his mask, revealing his face to Cable, who was unaware of their resemblance. Stryfe demanded Cable's\"Professor\", as it belonged to Apocalypse, in exchange for Kane. Cable agreed to trade after Kane was released. After Stryfe released Kane, Cable showed him a CD and then burned it. After a brief battle, Cable grabbed Kane and they teleported away.[26]\nWishing to repay everyone who had ever wronged him, Stryfe posed as Cable himself and publicly made an assassination attempt onProfessor Charles Xavier, founder of the X-Men. Stryfe's bullet infected Professor Xavier with the Techno-Organic Virus, which was still incurable at the current time. Stryfe also askedMr. Sinisterto kidnapScott SummersandJean Grey, in exchange for Summers' Family genetic material. Then, Stryfe traveled to Bani Maza,Egyptand awoke Apocalypse, who had never met Stryfe at this point, from his rejuvenation chamber and defeated him, stabbing him with a sword that he claimed that Apocalypse used to kill him at one point. Stryfe then seized control of his team of superhuman warriors, theDark Riders. Believing himself to be the real Nathan Summers, Stryfe tortured Cyclops and Jean Grey, blaming them for abandoning him as an infant, on Apocalypse'smoonbase. After the arrival of members of the X-Men,X-Factor, and X-Force, Stryfe and Cable had a climactic battle on the moon and fell through a time vortex, created by a machine Cable created from pieces in his arm. Cable survived, while Stryfe's body was supposedly annihilated. However, even though Stryfe’s body had been lost, an electromagnetic flux combined within their genetic similarities resulted in Stryfe's continued existence in Cable’s body.[31][32]\nAs a means of spreading further destruction, Stryfe had not given Sinister the Summers' genetic matrix, but theLegacy Virus, a disease genetically engineered to be lethal to mutants. This virus was similar to the one that the Clan Rebellion had attempted to destroy in the future and was far beyond even the best of scientists, biophysicists, and geneticists of the current time. The Legacy Virus infected a large number of mutants and killed many of them.[33]\nCable's body was found in the timestream, by agents of Tyler, and restored, but Stryfe's consciousness was projected into Cable's own mind and slowly took control after Cable returned to Earth. However, only one of them were capable of being in control, at any given time, and only when a specific frequency alignment occurred could one dominate the other. The first signs of Stryfe's influence was that Cable grew a goatee. After Mr. Sinister revealed to Cable that he created Madelyne Pryor-Summers and that Cable was the original Nathan Summers, he fired a blast at Cable, stating that he wanted to make him stronger, and Stryfe asserted full control over Cable's mind. After attacking Cable's X-Force membersRictorandSiryn, Stryfe went to Tyler's underground base, who had captured a member of the Askani, only known asSister Askani. Now aware that Tyler was in fact Mr. Tolliver, Stryfe intended to start his revenge with him. Tyler began to tell Stryfe what he had recently learned himself, that Stryfe was the clone, but Stryfe did not believe him. After Stryfe destroyed the form of Askani, Tyler used her memories to show Stryfe the truth of his origins, using his mutant power to give memory physical projection. At that moment, Cyclops, Jean, Professor X, and Zero arrived and battled Stryfe. Through the combined efforts of Jean and Professor X, Askani pleaded with Stryfe to leave and Stryfe, knowing that all hopes of curing the Legacy Virus would die with him, simply gave up and expelled himself from Cable's mind.[32]\nLater, Warpath was injected with drugs by the criminal scientistEdwin Martynecthat stopped his heart. Warpath's spirit was transported, by Stryfe's spirit, to thenetherworldruled by the demonBlackheart. Blackheart had promised to let Stryfe return to the world of the living, in Warpath's body, if Stryfe could defeat Warpath's spirit, but instead Warpath's spirit defeated Stryfe and returned to his body. Stryfe remained a prisoner in Blackheart's netherworld.[29]\nVery shortly after, Stryfe was, somehow, returned to the land of the living and attackedCastle DoominLatveria, in a pyramid. After emerging from the pyramid, Stryfe ordered the Dark Riders to kill all of the world's telepaths, starting with the most powerful. Stryfe was attacked byX-Man, analternateversion of Cable without the Techno-Organic Virus, and defeated him. Stryfe began to absorb Nate's psychic powers until Cable arrived, but Stryfe defeated them both. After Cable fled the pyramid with X-Man,Madelyne, a psychic ghost and ally of X-Man, began to consider Stryfe's plans of world domination, but it was revealed that she was absorbing Stryfe's psychic energies to empower Nate. Angry, Stryfe began to attack Madelyne and Nate usedDr. Doom's power siphoning device to negate Stryfe's pyramid's siphoning and Stryfe was seemingly killed in the resulting explosion.[34][35]\nSometime later, because he was not killed at a nexus in time, Stryfe returned from death. Stryfe attacked the X-Men at theXavier Institute for Higher Learning, attempting to gain theBete Noirsymbiote that had attached to the X-ManBishop. After Bishop andGambitfled toNew Orleansand met with theWitness, Stryfe appeared and asked for the two X-Men's aid, as Stryfe was weak and Cable was attempting to kill him. After Cable captured Stryfe, he took him to a nexus in time, the Witness' mausoleum, and telepathically made him experience all the deaths he caused. Cable considered killing Stryfe as \"an aberrant form of suicide\", as Stryfe was his clone. Cable stated that he has seen the future and will act to prevent it, but Stryfe responded that sinceSenator Robert Kelly's death, all futures have been disrupted and nothing is certain. At that time, Gambit, Bishop, and the Witness arrived and Stryfe explained that the Bete Noir was an ancient evil, that thePhoenix Forcebanished to the center of the Earth, and he intended to use it to destroy the Earth, as it was his nature. At that moment, the Bete Noir erupted from Bishop's chest, and Stryfe worked with Cable to contain it in a telekinetic force field. Bishop decided to sacrifice himself, but Stryfe apologized to Cable for those he killed and for everything else and absorbed the Bete Noir into himself, shattering his body from the power overload.[36]\nIn the near future, Stryfe was seen again and approached in the bar, Betty Noir's, inLas Vegas,Nevada, by the rogue X-Man, Bishop. Bishop propositioned a chance to kill Apocalypse, if Stryfe aided him in killing Cable, who Stryfe said he no longer cared about. After Bishop initiated a global catastrophe that wiped out most of the people on Earth, Stryfe was able to step in and fill the leadership void. Together, Stryfe and Bishop traveled to2963 A.D., where their combined efforts attackedApocalypsewhile he slept in his rejuvenation chamber, and defeated him, assuming they killed him. Stryfe stole hisCelestialShip and technology and used it to raise an army that gave him total control over the people, save for a small rebellion. Stryfe tyrannically ruled over his subjects, the Stryfetroopers, with Bishop as his right-hand-man for nearly a decade. Stryfe placed Ship inWestchester County,New Yorkand renamed the city, New Celestial City. Shortly after building his empire, Stryfe employedDeadpoolas security and imprisonedKiden Nixon, who was used to create a chronal net, preventing anyone from jumping out of the timeline.\nAfter his scouts found Cable in 2997 A.D., Bishop let his thoughts slip from his true intentions and Stryfe personally went to kill Cable. Stryfe found himself battling an older Cable and his allies, a new deadlierX-Force, and fled withHopeand Warpath. In his citadel, Stryfe tortured Warpath to learn of why X-Force and Cable were so far into the future. After Warpath refused to divulge any information, Stryfe turned his attention to Hope, who recognized his mouth and chin were similar to Cable's. At that moment, Bishop enacted his true intentions, to kill the girl, by releasing a nanite bomb and attacking Stryfe. Assuming that Bishop was attempting to kill him, Stryfe quickly recovered and attacked Bishop, saving Hope. After probing Bishop's mind, Stryfe went to Hope and allowed her to remove his mask, leading her to believe he was truly Cable, and assured her that the X-Men were lying to her. Stryfe told Hope that he was her father and they will be together forever. Bishop and Warpath tried to stop him, but Stryfe defeated them both. At that moment, Cable arrived withElixirand Wolverine mind-cloaked, and attacked Stryfe, nearly killing him.\nAfter defeating the pair and reading Elixir's mind, Stryfe learned the truth about Hope and decided to claim the girl's body for his own, much like Apocalypse once did him. Cable, X-Force, and Bishop continued to attack Stryfe, but was overpowering them, until the arrival ofArchangeland Apocalypse. Apocalypse survived Stryfe and Bishop's attack and Archangel found him. Apocalypse begged Archangel to kill him, but he refused and his techno-organic wings rejuvenated Apocalypse. After he was defeated, Stryfe was dragged away by Apocalypse, as Apocalypse stated he was about to fulfill his destiny: to become the next vessel for Apocalypse's soul.[37][38]\nStryfe was held captive by Apocalypse and was experimented on and tortured for years. He eventually managed to defeat Apocalypse and escaped, travelling backwards in time to seek vengeance on those that had brought about his capture. He eventually came upon Bishop, who had also returned to the present, and Hope Summers, who was trying to kill Bishop as vengeance for hunting her all her life. Stryfe decided to kidnap them both and brought them to an abandoned base formerly used by Stryfe's Mutant Liberation Front. Stryfe then attempted to manipulate Hope into killing Bishop, even though Bishop was restrained with chains and had become remorseful over his attempts to kill Hope to the point where he refused to even fight back. Stryfe's plan started to crumble when Cable, Cable's X-Force, and the Strike Team X-Force appeared and attacked Stryfe. Hope realized that Stryfe was trying to undo the lessons Cable had taught her over the years and chose not to kill Bishop, but did severely injure him. Stryfe was eventually defeated by Cable and both X-Force teams, but escaped and distracted his enemies by telepathically forcing Hope to mimic his immense psionic power, hoping that her friends would be killed when Hope inevitably lost control of the power. Bishop was able to help Hope to disperse the massive energy and both agreed to an uneasy truce.[39][40]\nStryfe was recruited byKang the Conqueroralong with a group of other time-displaced individuals into hisChrono Corpsto stop theApocalypse Twinsfrom wiping out Kang'snative universe, along with the respective realities of the Chronos Corps after the Twins tricked theCelestialsinto destroying Earth.[41]Stryfe and the Chronos Corps traveled to the Twins' Planet X inEarth-13133to aid the remnants of theAvengers Unity Divisionin rescuingWolverineandSunfire, so their minds could be sent back in time and warn their past counterparts of the Twins' machinations.[42]The plan was successful, but Stryfe was killed in battle whenMagnetomangled him with magnetism.[43]\nAfter unwittingly infecting his family with a deadly virus as part of a revenge scheme orchestrated byMadcap, Cable's allyDeadpoolfound himself forced to contact Stryfe, who had either turned up alive or was from a point in time before his death. Stryfe handed over to Wade a cure that had yet to be developed in his time,[44]with the condition he agreed to take four lives for him in the future.[45]Stryfe eventually decided to cash in on the favor, and ordered Deadpool to kill Cable, using Wade's daughterEllie Camachoas leverage to force him to comply.[46]\nStryfe later combats both Cable and his younger self, though he is eventually outmatched. He attempts to join Krakoa, as it welcomes all mutants, but both versions of Cable refuse to let him do this and kill Stryfe together.[7]\nStryfe is \"theOmega Levelclone\" of themutantCable(in his clonal source's own words),[49]and described himself as anOmega Level Mutant.[50]As a result of that clonal relation, he possess all of Cable's natural mutant abilities, including being anOmega Level Telekinetic.[49][50]Stryfe also possessed other abilities through genetic manipulation, similar to those that Cable achieved through cybernetic augmentation. His telepathy was stated to be far beyondPsylocke's, stated to be the third most powerful onEarth.[50]\nPsionics:Just like Cable, Stryfe's primary mutant powers included vasttelepathicandtelekineticcapabilities. While he was alive, Stryfe's psionic powers were vastly superior to those of Cable's due to the fact that the vast majority of Cable's psionic powers were, unconsciously, being devoted to keep theTechno-Organic Virus, that had ravaged the left half of his body, from doing the same to the right side.[51][52][53][54][55][56]\nTelepathy:Ability read minds and project the thoughts of others.\nTelekinesis: Capable of very fine control over objects, including himself. On larger levels, Stryfe can levitate great weights, into the hundreds of tons, but his upper limit has remained undisclosed.[51][52][53][54][55][56]\nGenetic Augmentation:Due toApocalypse's methods, many of Stryfe's physical attributes were enhanced to superhuman levels.[51][52][53][54][55][56]"

Pym also implanted a pairBio-Synthetic Wingsin her back that would allow Janet to fly when reduced in size. Furthermore, Pym outfitted the suit with wrist devices which allowed her to discharge blasts of bio-electricity she called her \"wasp's stings\".[1]Wasp's original suit was woven fromUnstable Molecules.[1]\nAfter the death of his wife Pym took up the Wasp identity and designed his own Wasp suit to honor Janet. He also implanted Bio-Synthetic Wings in his back that allowed him to fly.[2]\nNadia Pym's Wasp Suit\nNadia Pymwas the daughter Hank Pym didn't know he had. After escapingRed Room Academy, Nadia visited her father's house, only to discover that her father seemingly perished in a battle withUltron. Overcome with grief, she broke into his home and created her own Wasp Suit and Bio-Synthetic Wings.[3]\nAfter Underage Superhuman Welfare Act had been passed that outlawed superhero activity involving those below twenty-one years of age. Nadia was arrested and her suit was confiscated byC.R.A.D.L.E..[4]But it was taken back by Nadia after she broke out of prison.[5]\nSize Reduction:The suit originally allowed Janet the ability to reduce herself in size, down to the dimensions of the insect from which she takes her name, roughly 1/2 inch in height. She usually chooses not to retain her standard density while at this reduced mass, but can choose to do so at will. The \"lost\" mass is shunted to a pocket dimension for later retrieval. Additionally, her strength was boosted while she is at reduced size, to the extent that she can bend a one-inch diameter steel bar almost double. Her size allows her to be easily unnoticed in most cases, allowing her  to become stealthy in some cases. Over repeated exposure she was able to produce the Pym Particles internally.\nBio-Synthetic Wings:Due to small implanted insect wings, the Wasp could fly at incredibly fast speeds. These are functional when she reduced herself in height, and can remain so until reaching a height that is a nearly foot shorter than her normal height. Her flight speed can also allow her to gain a form of superhuman reflexes and agility, being able to easily evade targets and attacks.\nWasp's Sting:The Wasp could generate powerful bio-electric blasts from her hand that have been shown to be capable of cutting through high-density structures and is able to cause extreme pain to superhumanly strong and highly durable beings. At first they were part of her suit, but in time Pym internalized it so she could produce them herself.[6]\nWasp Goggles:As the Wasp, Henry Pym wears a pair of specially designed goggles that enhanced his peripheral vision and could make video recordings of whatever he saw, they also contained a retinal scanner and analytical sensors, including devices that analyzed different kinds of energy, even magical energy, transmit his thoughts as radio frequencies to receiving radio equipment such as his Ant-Man helmet, and communicate with insects when not serving as eye protection.[7]"

James was a foundling, discovered in theCanadianwilds and taken byJohn Howlettas a replacement for his stillborn son.[2]\nThe young James was kept at home and away from the public eye, with his family insisting to the child that he was always sick and must stay in bed. The drastic change in environment caused the young James to indeed become frail and sickly, until his true heritage manifested itself upon witnessing the murder of his adopted father.[2]\nWith his family gone, James took the name \"Logan\", and returned to the wilds where he had been born. As a side effect of his healing factor, Logan's memories steadily faded and he became a wanderer, drifting from job to job. He eventually encounteredSabretooth, another descendant of the unaltered humans. Logan barely survived their first encounter, and the two became lifelong enemies.[2]\nCoveted for his healing factor, Logan was captured by the Canadian government and underwent experiments to bond the unbreakable metalAdamantiumto his bones. He subsequently became a member ofAlpha Flightbefore being recruited byProfessor Xto join theX-Men. Xavier convinced Logan that he was amutant, either unaware or unconcerned with Logan's true origins. Logan would always struggle with his savage nature conflicting with the \"civilized\" environment he was now a part of.[2]\nLogan's subsequent career as a hero largely mirrors the early career of hisEarth-616counterpart. While a member of the X-Men he developed a romantic interest in teammateJean Grey, despite the fact that she was together with team captainCyclops.\nWhen all of humanity suddenly mutated, global chaos followed. The mutation activated the powers of theSkull, causing the instant death of every telepath on Earth, including Xavier. Desperate to contain the emerging mutants, the world's governments re-activated theSentinelsto herd them into detention camps. This effort was foiled byMagneto, who lured the Sentinels into a trap, destroyed them, and fashioned the mutant sanctuary ofSentinel Cityfrom their remains.[3]\nWith all of humanity now mutants, and with their founder dead, the X-Men disbanded. Around this time, Jean Grey, who had lost her powers and thus survived the birth of the Skull, left Cyclops to pursue a romance with Wolverine. The couple eventually settled down inNew York City.[4]\nWith Jean struggling with the loss of her powers and adapting to a normal life, Logan sought the help ofDr. Miles Warrenin limiting his healing factor so that he could grow old with Jean. He hoped that this would bring them together and prevent them from drifting apart like she and Cyclops had, but it was ultimately futile.[5]Years after the mutation of humanity and their retirement as heroes, Logan and Jean Grey had developed into a stereotype of the bickering New York couple, both of them overweight and miserable. Logan spent his time in front of the TV, insisting that his healing factor prevented him from getting fat, despite being grossly overweight, and constantly arguing with Jean.[3]\nWhen the Skull led an army of mind-controlled superhumans to conquer New York, Logan sat by, watching the events unfold on TV. When Jean asked him to get involved with defending the city, Logan derisively told her to shut up. This was the last straw, and Jean left him, angrily telling him that she was actuallyMadelyne Pryoron the way out, to spite him.[6]\nLogan's life presumably continued unaltered, despite the momentous events that occurred in the world around him, such as the ecological disasters ravaging the world after the death of theCelestialembryo within Earth, the attacks of theChurch of ImmortusandAbsorbing Manon New York, and even the destruction ofDeathitself.[7][8][9]\nWolverine attended the wedding ofQueen MedusaandKing Britain, which would serve as an impromptu reunion of the survivingX-Men. He was reunited with Jean, who confessed that she had lied about being Madelyne Pryor to spite him. While there, Logan encountered analternate reality versionof himself, brought toEarth-9997byX-51. This version of Logan had been promised the truth of his origins in exchange for aiding X-51.[10]\nWhen X-51 learned of Wolverine's origins as an unaltered human, he told the alternate Logan, who sought his counterpart out in his New York home. He revealed the truth of their origins, telling him that it was his choice what to do with the information. While at first bothered by the revelation, Logan soon began laughing hysterically. Freed from the burden of having to fit into a society he did not belong in, he shed his clothes, jumped into theHudson Riverand returned to the wilds, far away from the world of man.[11]\nLogan found himself drafted´into a group composed of hismultiversalcounterpartsby an alternate reality version ofJean Grey. Jean gathered the group ofWolverinesfor the purpose of stoppingOnslaught, a psychic entity composed of the darkest sides ofJean GreyandMagneto.[12]Logan struggled to keep up with the other Wolverines, due to his weakened healing factor and years of sedentary life, but managed to contribute.[5]\nWolverine has the same powers as hisEarth-616 counterpart."

Seeking revenge, Thor blessed Jarnbjorn with his own blood, giving it the power to pierce Celestial armor.

In addition, Jarnbjorn has a charm placed on it that makes it indestructible, and it can be used to defend against any attack, even bursts of energy like Apocalypse's optic beam. Thanks to Thor's own enchantment, Jarnbjorn can pierce the armor of Celestials or armor created using Celestial technology.[5]"

Cyclops objects to this, but Magneto reminds that his brother threatens their future on the mere hope that he can change it.\nPsylocke fights her future self Magistrate Braddock. The Magistrate remarks how hypocritical her past self was since their last encounter, swearing never to become like her, when now she rules on the X-Council, keeping the \"peace\" X-Force style, the way the Magistrate believes is the only way. Stabbing her future self in the head with her psi-blade, Psylocke retorts that she never chose to rule, but she was handed this fate.\nCable faces against Stryfe, who points out his hypocrisy, once a proud freedom fighter reduced to Uriel's servant and attacks him with a psi attack.\nBeast attempts to protect Wasp from X-Force but is swiftly restrained by Avalanche as Blob moves to kill the defenseless Avengers.\nMagneto demands one more time as to Kang's plan but Havok refuses to talk. Ultimately, Cyclops decides that enough is enough and blasts Magneto. Helping his brother up, he asks if Kang really can restore the Earth. Havok admits what while Kang covets Earth, he has his daughter Katie. The Summers brothers reconcile.\nMeanwhile, Thor unleashes his vengeance against Uriel while Venom subdues Daken. But as he readies to deliver the final blow with Jarnbjorn, Kang restrains him, telling him to stop wasting time and free his fellow Avengers. Kang then turns his wrath on Uriel, calling her attempts to usurp his throne pathetic and immobilizes her. Daken gets free and attempts to attack the Conqueror, only to be attacked by Wolverine. Though he subdues his son, he refuses to kill him again.\nSunfire unleashes a fiery inferno against Banshee for the years of torture he suffered at his hands. His true personality breaking through, Banshee reminds Sunfire that he was once a Horseman and that wasn't his fault that he couldn't control his actions. Wolverine tells his teammate that he's right and urges him to get going.\nDoom of 2099 stops Blob from killing Wasp but Magneto makes a comeback, mangling Stryfe and immobilizing everyone else. Suddenly, Cyclops and his fellow X-Men openly rebel against X-Force to buy the Unity Squad time to complete their mission.\nWith the Unity Squad assembled, Wolverine warns Kang that if they aren't sent back to before Rogue gets killed, he'll make sure that he doesn't have an Earth left to conquer. Kang scoffs this, but Thor stands up to him, reminding that Wolverine was tortured for a half a decade and for once he should show some empathy for someone else. However, Wasp disagrees and attacks Kang, demanding he return her daughter. Kang states that he gave Katie back, she'd be erased along with this whole future, hence he's keeping her in the slipstream. Assuming Earth is restored, he will return Katie. However, Sunfire doesn't trust Kang, but Wolverine knocks him out, saying that he'll fall in line once they're in the past.\nThor makes a speech, telling the Avengers that this is their chance to redeem themselves for failing the Earth. Back then, the reason they lost is because they were divided, because they did not behave as heroes.

Scarlet Witch is in bed with Wonder Man, agonizing over the results of following the Apocalypse Twin's plan. Wonder Man tries to calm her, telling her it is a good plan. The pair are interrupted by Rogue, Wolverine and Havok, who explain that thanks to mind-bonding with their future selves, they know that Eimin of the Apocalypse Twins is using her precognitive synaesthesia to trick them, setting up events so that Scarlet Witch is killed by an X-Man. Rogue reveals herself as that X-Man, then apologises, stealing Scarlet Witch's powers with a hug.\nDawn. Iron Man is organizing the Avengers in an attempt to stave off Exitar the Executioner, when the assemblage is greeted by the Unity Squad, who explain that they have a plan: Rogue borrows the powers of every Avenger she can, then uses the combined power to hold back Exitar personally. She can suucceed where their forcefield plan will fail. As a show of trust, Wonder Man gives her his powers. Captain America says he is behind her, but Rogue corrects him: they are all in this together.\nOn the Apocalypse Twin's spacecraft, Eimin and Uriel are reacting adversely to the news that Scarlet Witch is gone. Eimin's prediction that the Unity Squad's squabbles would divide them is proving untrue. Which means that Kang, their time-travelling tyrranical father figure, is moving against them.\nOver comms, Grim Reaper assures the Apocalypse Twins that he is enough to protect the Tachyon Dam, especially from Wasp, the predicted Avenger. He gloats that he can defeat her because she will not kill... only for Havok, Wolverine and Sunfire to step out of the shadows, saying they came in her place.\nAt the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, Rogue teleports into the staffroom, explaining that she needs to borrow their powers.\nOn their ship, the Apocalypse Twins decide to respond to their unravelling plan by taking matters into their own hands. Uriel reaches for Jarnbjorn... only to discover it is not there.\nOn the roof of Avengers Tower, Captain America walks Iron Man through the plan as it happens. Iron Man is suspicious, as Cap will not explain who gave them the plan. However, even he is impressed when Rogue catches Exitar by one foot and slows his descent.  Cap says they have an ace in the hole, courtesy of Wasp and Thor.\nAt the other foot, Wasp has arrived with their ace: Sentry, the final Horseman of Death. While monologuing about his need to kill the mutants since he is the heir of Apocalypse, he holds up Exitar's other foot.\nThor appears at the stymied Exitar's neck. As the only one of the Avengers who can think on the Celestial's level, he admits that he wants to plead Earth's case, but knows it will do no good against a Celestial, whose identityistheir job. So he cuts a hole in the Celestial's neck and proceeds to siphon out excess energy, using the teleport power of Mjolnir to transfer the energy to a dying star orbited by living worlds, where it will bring life and sustain existence. At the same time, Wolverine's group destroys the Apocalypse Twins' Tachyon Dam. The day is saved...\n...until Kang, the source of the heroes' plan, begins his double-cross. Deathlok Abomination seemingly commits suicide by dragging Thor into the Celestial's cosmic energy. The rest of the Chronos Corps rounds up the Avengers and prepares to kill them. Kang himself uses his futuristic devices to drain the energy from the Celestial, becoming a new godlike being...\nAVENGE THE EARTH Finale!\n• This is it!

He quickly made his way to the capital and found a new ruler, the cyborgTiger Wylde, enthroned in his place. Wylde explained to him that he was in the year 2099 and that after his absence Latveria was left leaderless, and it was only Wylde's intervention that saved it from being annexed by the corporations. Doom, however, was still furious and demanded that Wylde remove himself from his throne. When Wylde ignored him, they fought, but in the end Wylde's advanced technology triumphed. Doom was defeated and Wylde pulled off his mask to reveal his face, but found that he had the unscarred visage of a young man, in spite of what history had taught about Doom. Wylde then burned Doom's exposed face to match history's description. Thinking him a cheap impostor, Wylde ordered his tarot card reader,Fortune, to dispose of him, and thus Doom was ejected from his own capital city.\nWithout an armor\nInstead of letting Doom die, Fortune saw him as her only chance to overthrow Wylde, and so she took him back to her Romani clan,Zefiro, Doom's own descendants. There Doom found new allies, and together they flew to the headquarters of thePixel corporationon the Isla Lobos de Afuera. They found a doctor there namedCelia Quiñones, who they persuaded to enhance Doom with nanotechnology, increasing his motor responses and neural capabilities. Combined with stolen Pixel technology that he built into a new suit of armor, the man who called himself Doctor Doom now dubbed himself, simply, Doom.[3]\nHe then began his campaign to win back Latveria. Doom first stole a shipment of tritonium that was being sent to Wylde, increasing tension between Latveria and the Pixel corporation. Then he handed out food to the Latverian masses in order to earn their loyalty when the eventual overthrow happened. Finally, when Wylde came after Doom instead, he coerced him with a tritonium bomb to fight him alone, and eventually when their fight remained a standstill, Doom detonated the tritonium, bringing down a mountain upon the two of them, and then using his armor's phase shifter, he saved himself and passed unharmed through the mountain. Latveria, again, was under the control of Doom.[4]\nDoom's next adversary was the Pixel corporation itself, and its head,Eduardo Devargas. Devargas, uncomfortable with Doom's rise to power and the theft of the tritonium, sent a cyberspace being known asFeveragainst Doom, infecting his computers and even the systems of his armor. This forced Doom to enter cyberspace with the netglider Romani, Wire, and face Fever. The human virus attacked Doom first by sending him into a gameism in which he fought a twisted and far from historically-accurate version of the 20th Century'sFantastic Four. Only after absorbing the info-gathering abilities of a discarded program namedPaloma, was Doom able to gather enough power inCyberspaceto face off against Fever directly, and finally, destroy him. In the process, Doom accidentally allowed the program Paloma to become sentient, but despite a brief struggle, they both realized that they needed each and came to a compromise. WithPaloma's help, Doom was able to take physical control of Pixel and defeat its former head, Devargas. And with Doom's help, Paloma was able to run free in cyberspace. During this confrontation, Doom also faced a computer simulation involving a series of fictional and historical figures such as Jack the Ripper and Professor Moriarty in an attempt to regain his lost memory, but the attempt failed, leaving him more confused.[5]\nDoom later fought a pair of strange foes. First, was the resurrected patriarch of the future nation ofWakanda, a king namedThandaza, whose granddaughter,Princess Okusana, built him in a cyborg body to bring him back, so that she could avoid the pressures of leadership.[6]Doom finally defeated Thandaza, returning him to a grateful death, but not before plugging in and ransacking Wakanda of its technology, including the design of their Environmental Maintenance Platforms that kept its air clean of pollutants.[7]Next, he fought an ancient being known as Necrotek, who was once defeated by the threeEyes of Agamotto, in the hands of Caius the Spartan. With the help of the Romani's young adept, Vox, and his single Eye of Agamotto, Doom banished Necrotek with a Caius Circle drawn in cyberspace, where Necrotek had anchored himself, using information Doom found in a hidden library of mystical texts.[8]\nWhen the man-beast Ravage stole the plans fromAlchemax's floating city Valhalla, Doom appeared to him and deciphered them, finding that the thrusters were its weakness. Doom traveled to Valhalla and met up with one ofAvatarr's nano-engineered superheroes, Loki, as well as the body of Heimdall, defeated by2099's X-Men. Avatarr's Thor appeared shortly later and attacked Doom, angered by Heimdall's death. In an attempt to stop Thor, Doom overloaded the source of his power,Mjolnir, but the resulting explosion threw both combatants miles away. When Doom recovered, he returned to face Avatarr, and discovered that the flaw in the engines which would soon send the city crashing to the ground in the middle of New York was well known by Avatarr, who was oblivious to the damage it would cause.[9]Finally, Doom teamed up with2099's Spider-Man,Punisher, andRavageto bring down Valhalla.[10]However, once it was under control, Doom appropriated the flying city and made it a new providence of Latveria.[11]\nLater, while searching for signs of the alien life that he remembered from the 20th Century, Doom stumbled across a source inAntarcticathat was sending and receiving a signal from deep space. Doom traveled to Antarctica to investigate the signal and found a being calledRadianwho used a technology based on manipulation of light itself.[12]Radian bested Doom and transported then to the Chin Shan Space Station, where Doom's ally Fortune was held captive by a woman namedFeng Huangwhile Fortune was searching for her lost brother she presumed dead, along with Fortune's guideLei Fong, Huang's sister. Doom downloaded some of the technology from the spherical craft that had sent the signal and followed Radian to the space station. Once there, Radian announced that he was an emissary of an alien race named theY'lestjaand the Collective, who offered human beings a place in its benevolent quest to gain all universal knowledge. The Collective then accessed the minds of Earth, pulling out all the important symbols and archetypes that gave meaning to Earth culture, and left, but first gave Radian his autonomy as a separate being. Feng Huang immediately attacked the vulnerable Radian and set her station to self-destruct. Doom then fought Feng Huang for Radian's armor, but both failed, and Doom rocketed away from the station in an escape pod just as it exploded, falling to Earth into the Savage Land.[13]\nDoom crawled from his escape pod as his armor malfunctioned and he faced against an attacking Tyrannosaur, which he killed with his last remaining energy. Though the fight against the dinosaur exhausted the last of his armor's reserve and it began to burn his skin, forcing Doom to remove it and finally collapse unconscious into strange dreams of a soldier's life, leaving Doom with more questions about his true identity. The X-ManBloodhawkappeared and confused him for a hunter. Angered, Bloodhawk took him to the Village of the Sky where a group led by Chalda and Carson Leibowitz, who told Doom about anAlchemaxexecutive named Christian L'Argent who came to the Savage Land to obtain drilling rights from the local tribe, but then became obsessed with local traditions and magic. Doom led the group back to the sight of his escape pod crash to find his dropped armor, but a member of the local swamp tribe had taken it, and Doom's group eventually tracked the armor to the tribe, but was captured by L'Argent, his men, and the swamp tribe. L'Argent appeared deranged and mutated thanks to a local herbal drug, and he decided to sacrifice Doom and his group to the gods to stop the earthquakes which were being caused by L'Argent's own drilling. But during the ritual another earthquake interrupted L'Argent, bringing down the temple on everyone. While the rest escaped, Doom face L'Argent, who revealed to him that the world corporations were secretly controlled by a pair of shadows who manipulated them from afar, once of which was the supposed true Victor Von Doom. But before Doom could find out more, one of L'Argent's men, an android spy, shot him. Doom killed the android in response, finding the robot technology strangely familiar.[14]\nAfter returning to Latveria and repairing his armor, Doom consulted Fortune who prophesied that Doom would soon face a great threat. Then Doom, filled with the dread that he was actually the mercenary soldier in his dreams, traveled to the info city Myridia, and blackmailed its leader, General Tibor Diaghilev Czerny into turning its resources over to him, making him the new head of Myridia. The General agreed, believing that Doom was actually Erik Kristofer Czerny, his lost son. But before he could find out more, a rebuiltTiger Wylde, sent by a mysterious figure that appeared to be the real Victor Von Doom, attacked Doom. He defeated the android, but the General was killed in the process, and Doom was forced to reprogram the computers of Myridia that were hooked up to the General's life signs, fooling them into thinking the General was still alive. Doom then traveled in the floating city Valhalla to the hidden island in the middle of the Pacific, and after finishing off Tiger Wylde, who had followed him, he finally faced the man claiming to be the true Doctor Doom. After a fight which took the combatants through a series of different time periods, Doom bested his double, discovering in the process that he was the true Doom, but his partner Margaretta Von Geisterstadt had rebuilt him using the soldier's DNA, and stuck scattered memories of the soldier's life in his head to confuse him as part of a centuries long game they played against each other. Un-amused, Doom abandoned Margaretta, and left her and her creation to the temporal destruction caused by their frantic time-shifting. The island fortress then disappeared into itself, killing both inhabitants.[15]\nDoom then began a plot to become the President of the United States, a position that had atrophied since the corporations came to power, but still retained its original powers. He started by inciting riots inMakhelastanto destabilize the American corporation, Angel's Breath, who secretly controlled that country.[16]Then, when his part-time ally Poet was killed in a fight with drug dealers, Doom used his funeral to make new connections with info brokers and data pirates.[17]His next step was to build an organized strike force of net gliders called theCyberdive Cadre, headed by the expert netglider, Indigo Eshun. She, in turn, helped to rebuild Doom's Romani hacker, Wire, who was previously killed by Margaretta, into a being that lived half in cyberspace with his lover, Paloma, and half in the real world, giving Doom a constant, physical link to the Cyberdive Cadre. Using his diplomatic pull with Wakanda, Doom also hired their crack troop squad, the Panther's Rage, as well as their commander, Nkrumah. Along with the mutant, Morphine Somers, and the mercenary, Sharp Blue, Doom was ready to invade America.[2]\nHe first sent the Cyberdive Cadre to tie up America's communications. Then, Doom personally invaded the country using the floating city Valhalla, now named Libera Cielo (Clear Sky in Latverian), and destroyed both the Angel Breath headquarters and the Senate, killing everyone inside. Next, Nkrumah's troops attacked the White House honor guards, the American Captains, and Doom himself broke into the White House and forced the former President to commit suicide instead of being killed.[18]\nDoom's first act as President was to create his Black Cabinet. This consisted of Indigo Eshun as his Minister of Signal, Nkrumah as his Minister of Enemy Relations, Morphine Somers as his Minister for Humanity, and Sharp Blue as the Minister of Order. He also dissolved the Public Eye and other security forces, and rebuilt them as a new incarnation of S.H.I.E.L.D., with Jake Gallows, the former Punisher, as the head and Doom's Minister of Punishment.[19]Additionally, Doom hired 2099's Ghost Rider as his Federal Marshall to keep order in Transverse City.[20]\nHe continued to make changes, putting cyberspace-connected Dive Booths in every city. Then he created a national corporation called Cynex, and arrested the heads of the previous corporations, downgraded the credit levels of all citizens from the unlimited Black Cards to Gold Cards, and forced the corporation CEOs to choose one amongst them to be killed. They unanimously chose Avatarr, and when Doom attempted to kill him off-handedly, Avatarr revealed himself as a powerful alien with hallucinogens for blood. Doom eventually killed him, but not before he was affected by the hallucinogens, and recorded a public broadcast where he threatened the American populace for allowing Avatarr to pass unknown amongst them.[21]\nUsing Doom's now damaged reputation as a lever,John Herod, the head of the Chicago Reserve, a secret vault full of outlawed technology, brainwashed amanfor believing himself to beCaptain America (Steve Rogers)and started his own attack upon the Presidency of America. Herod sent Wave Spiders, genetically-engineered, living weapons, against Doom's cabinet, sending Nkrumah back to Wakanda, forcing Sharp Blue to flee to Mexico, and killing Indigo Shun. The Wave Spiders then destroyed Doom's Libera Cielo and traveled to Latveria where they bombed the populace using necrotoxins, which reduced all living matter to a protein-rich sludge. Next, Herod destroyed the White House and rebuilt it using nanotech robots as the Red House, putting Captain America in the President's seat as a false leader.\nHerod also attacked Doom, who abandoned Washington D.C. and saved a young mutant named Annie Wagner from Shield troopers, then retreated to the mutant haven, Halo City.[22]Doom used the resources of the city, which he created, to again rebuild his armor. He also attacked the leader of Halo City, Morphine Somers, whom he had put in place, and threatened him to use his power properly, or he would come for him.[23]Doom left Halo City and headed to Washington D.C. Back at the capital, Doom used nanotech robots to take apart the Red House, along with everyone inside, including the fake Captain America, then used the same robots to eat away at Herod, sentencing him to a life of constant pain. Then, after putting Shakti Haddad in charge of the young mutant team, X-Nation, Doom used a hidden teleporter to travel back to Latveria to rebuild his home nation.[24]\nArmed with a plan to repair the problems of the world by making small changes to every nation, Doom plugged himself into the dataweb to start his worldwide machinations. But his plan backfired, and his consciousness expanded to the point where he felt the deaths of every one of his subjects from the necrotoxin, and he was forced to unplug to save his mind from the emotional pain. He then decided to travel into the past to find a way to save his people before they were attacked, and to that end he found himself again in the late 20th Century.[25]Doom discovered a species of crab which secreted an addictive substance being used by drug dealers, which he found could make a populace all but immune the effects of necrotoxin over time, so against his principles, he decided to addict all of Latveria in the late 1900s in order to save them in the future. Though the Fantastic Four, Namor, Daredevil, and the younger incarnation of Doctor Doom distrusted his intentions and fought with him to stop his plans. Eventually, Doom was able to analyze the chemical and store the information in his armor's mask before returning to the future.[26]\nBack in 2099, Doom found the remains of the Latverian people being led by Fortune and her brother, Kazimierz Rosikon, previously repaired by Margaretta while she was alive. Few of the populace had survived, and many that had were mutated into beings Kaz called mutalocos. Despite their lack of gratefulness, the Latverians again banded together with Doom when a massive planetoid arrived to orbit Earth, destroying the planet's environment and endangering the entire populace due to its gravitational pull. A man claiming to be the original Reed Richards, transported from the 20th Century, implored Doom to help against the Atlanteans and their leader Attuma, who had used the surface world's confusion to invade. Doom agreed and helped forced back the Atlanteans, saving the populace of New York and the surrounding areas long enough for them to escape to the Savage Land to rebuild.[27][28]\nDoom also fought back an attempted invasion on Latverian soil from the Atlanteans, and taunted Attuma with death or self-destruction. Then, responding to a summons from Fortune, Doom found Wire, who had previously committed suicide when the woman he loved was killed in Doom's American bid for power, had been reassembled from cyberspace by the Collective. Doom accepted Wire's invitation to meet with the Collective's emissary and found himself transported elsewhere. The Collective threatened Doom, telling him that they were going to assimilate all of Earth and needed him to help him find the scouts that they implanted on their last visit, but before they could force him to comply, Kaz appeared, dressed in Radian's armor. Kaz claimed he was sent by the Y'Lestja and pronounced himself the protector of planet Earth. Despite this, Doom still offered to make an exchange and give the Collective one of their scouts in exchange for the restoration of his beloved Latveria.\nAt some point in his timeline prior to hispresidential bid, Doom witnessed the unraveling of his timeline as a result of theApocalypse Twins' actions inthe early 21st century. He was recruited byKang the Conquerorfor hisChronos Corps, comprised of inhabitants of the seven prime timelines threatened by the temporal wave collapse.[29]\nDoom joined Kang in thealternate futureofPlanet X, a mutants-only colony created in the aftermath ofEarth's destruction. Working with afuture versionof the telepathPsylocke, Doom helped send the consciousness of the members of theAvengers Unity Divisionback in time to possess theirpast selves, armed with knowledge of the future to change the course of history.[30]\nDoom is a genius in physics, robotics, cybernetics, genetics, weapons technology, biochemistry, and time travel. He is also self-taught in the mystic arts. Doom is a natural leader, a brilliant strategist, and a sly deceiver.\nDoom wore a sophisticated nuclear-powered titanium battlesuit which granted him superhuman strength, contained jets for flight, housed a personal force field, and discharged concussive force blasts; he could also electrify his armor's surface. The armor contained a 4-hour air supply, and could be sealed for travel into outer space or underwater. Special attachments to the armor had included a molecular-expander, which can cause molecules to expand into the size of boulders, and various devices for absorbing the energies of others (such as the Silver Surfer).\nIn 2099, Doom's armor was upgraded multiple times, but with many of the same abilities as his old suit, just more powerful and advanced. Some of the newer upgrades included a phase shifter, allowing him to become insubstantial and pass through solid objects, as well as a cyberspace link, allowing his mind to access cyberspace through his armor. During a fight with the copy Doctor Doom of 2099, he also upgraded his suit with a remote activator for his time platform. He also sealed off the eye slits which were previously open, covering them with red lenses."

As they arrive at theParliament of Pantheons, the Godbomb's effects reach the timeline ofEarth-616and all the gods present collapse asGorr's dark weaponbegins consuming them from the inside-out.\nInthe far future, theGoddesses of ThunderandYoung Thorare sent flying by the Godbomb's detonation, which destroys the entire planet. At the core of the blast,King Thorattempts to strangleGorreven as the Godbomb slowly kills him, Gorr mocking him as he loses strength and collapses. At the epicentre, where time has slowed to a crawl, Thor the Avenger reaches out and grabs both his own Mjolnir and that of King Thor, striking them together and taking the Godbomb's blast into his body. Across time, all manner of gods have a vision of Thor attempting to sacrifice himself to save them and pray to him - including his own fatherOdin. As the Mjolnirs crack and crumble, theliving darknessceases its temporal assault and engulfs Thor.AtliandFriggmarvel that they're still alive, but Young Thor points out that Gorr is too. Shocked by his defeat, Gorr wonders where his Black Berserkers, towers, and weapon have gone. Clad in armor of living darkness and wielding two Mjolnirs, Thor the Avenger speaks in a distorted voice and tells Gorr that his dark weapon has a name - All-Black the Necrosword - and that it mocks him for thinking he - originally a mere mortal - could unleash its full power when it's meant to be wielded by a god. As Gorr begs Thor to return All-Black to him, Thor states that he was right when he said it was meant to kill gods - blasting him with bolts of divine lightning and darkness. Badly wounded, Gorr denounces the gods as the doom of life, only forAgarto suddenly appear and ask if it was a god who killed his mother. Agar denounces Gorr as the god of hypocrisy, stating that it wasn't the gods who betrayed Gorr, but Gorr who betrayed himself as he melts into living darkness. The three Thors and the Goddesses of Thunder watch as the darkness that was once Agar forms into a small jagged stone dagger; King Thor explaining to his confused younger selves that \"Agar\" was actually a manifestation of Gorr's subconscious self-loathing and desire to be put out of his misery, manifested through All-Black. As Gorr lets out a scream of despair, Young Thor smugly decapitates him with Jarnbjorn. Thor the Avenger abruptly collapses, vomiting living darkness as King Thor notes that All-Black is still inside him and needs to be purged. Thor the Avenger states that it's too late before collapsing, dead for the ninth time.\nOn Asgard three days later, Thor the Avenger awakens musing about a hellish dream he'd had where there were three of him. He abruptly realizes it wasn't a dream when King Thor grumps that dying must've made him even dumber than before, Young Thor quipping that he's probably thirsty too. Thor the Avenger asks what became of Gorr and the Necrosword, King Thor stating that Gorr's body was immolated and that the Necrosword was left where it fell. Young Thor boasts that he would've taken the Necrosword for himself, but that King Thor destroyed it by throwing the entire planet into ablack holebefore he could do so. King Thor states that he burnt out the last of the Thor-Force purging the remnants of All-Black from Thor's body and resurrecting him, asking his younger self if he'd like to see what he died for. King Thor takes his younger selves on a tour of Asgard, which is being rebuilt and settled by the survivors from Gorr's mines - who are free to return to their old worlds or find new ones whose gods were slain. Young Thor remarks that he's still finding it hard to believe he becomes the All-Father, noting that by Asgard's decrepit condition he does a terrible job. King Thor retorts that his youngest self will learn the hard way that he's terrible at a number of things, will watch many loved ones die as a result, and will never acquire the one thing he desires most. Young Thor notes that King Thor wielding two Mjolnirs means he's wrong, but King Thor states he's talking about obtaining Odin's approval. Angered, Young Thor storms off, complaining that his future self is just as stern and callous as his father before demanding to be returned to his proper time. Thor the Avenger chastizes King Thor for being so harsh with their past self, but King Thor states he was also talking to himself. Elaborating, he states that he owes Thor the Avenger a great debt for rekindling his determination, but that he cannot look at him without feeling immense self-loathing at everything he failed at. King Thor tells Thor the Avenger to avert this future by being a better Thor than him and by killingLokithe first chance he gets; Thor the Avenger replying by telling him to live to the end of time and prove Gorr wrong. King Thor asks what they should do if Gorrwasn'twrong, Thor the Avenger stating that just means they have their work cut out for them. Recalling a certain world whose brutal gods were killed, Thor the Avenger has All-Father Thor send some of the homeless gods toIndigarr. King Thor uses the power of the All-Father to return his past selves to their proper times, their memories of having met each other being erased in the process.\nReturning to Asgard, Young Thor attempts to lay claim to Mjolnir and manages to get the hammer to budge slightly. King Thor catches up with his granddaughters before settling down on his throne, and Thor the Avenger travels to Indigarr to tell the child who had prayed to him that her world is no longer without gods.\n• The grand finale of the epic time-traveling saga of the God Butcher that began in issue #1."

On his dark world,Gorrrips a fissure open into the planet's mantle and castsThor the Avengerinto its molten depths; encasing theMjolnirsin a cage of dead and wounded gods andliving abyss. Clad inarmor formed from eldritch darkness, Gorr drags Young Thor to witness the detonation of theGodbomb.Arraapproches Gorr and asks if he's alright, but he sternly tells her to get back inside as it's time to detonate the Godbomb. Arra is overjoyed, praising Gorr for never wavering in his conviction, no matter the odds against him, and saying that he is the only being worthy of being called a god. When Arra says that he is her god, Gorr abruptly stops and turns to look at her in rage, telling her to repeat herself. Before Arra can do so, Gorr kills her, snarling that he is no-one's god.Agararrives and asks Gorr if it's time to detonate the Godbomb, asking where his mother is. Gorr tells him to look for her in the towers, but not to wait for him as he has too many gods to kill. Agar eagerly states it's finally time to kill them all, glancing to where Arra's body is melting into molten darkness.\nEntangled in the cage encasing the Mjolnirs,Friggattempts to grab one of them.Ellisivrebukes her for thinking herself worthy of wielding it, asking if she thinks she could do what three Thors failed to; but Frigg snaps that she'd rather die hammer in hand than snared like a fly in a web. Uncharacteristically subdued,Atlitells her sisters to save their energy, and when Frigg irritably asks what she should be saving it for Atli says she'd rather die by her own hand than grant Gorr the satisfaction of killing her. Unwilling to give up, Frigg resumes struggling to reach one of the Mjolnirs.\nReaching the Godbomb, Gorr remarks to Young Thor that his masterpiece is beautiful, explaining that it was designed byShadrakof theDiamond Moons of Oghogho- after he'd been driven insane by the brutal murders of all his friends, of course. Conjuring a staircase of darkness, Gorr explains that the Godbomb will use the heart of the infant elder god and thePool of Foreversto spread his weapon's eldritch darkness across time and space, killing every deity that has ever existed and ever will exist - stating that Young Thor's blood should suffice to complete it.\nMiles below, Thor struggles to climb out of the volcanic fissure only to be approached by Agar, who tells him he'll never make it in time. Thor tells Agar to get away from the lava and get off-world; but Agar states that he cannot leave, adding that he is what Gorr made him to be. Agar philosophically muses to Thor that the real question is not what he is, but what Gorr is; stating that Gorr used to be a good and simple man who suffered unjustly, and wondering what the Gorr of the past would have to say about his present self. Spotting the weapons of the enslaved gods entombed in the rock, Thor begins excavating them and again tells Agar to take his family and leave. Agar states that his mother is dead; lamenting that she had deluded herself dreaming of a peaceful life in a world without gods, but that she was killed by Gorr just as he'd killed the kind man he'd once been. Stating that Gorr is dead, Agar uses tendrils of darkness to save Thor the Avenger from falling into the lava and says that he will pray for him to kill the evil deity known as the God Butcher. As the planet quakes, Ellisiv expresses dismay, Frigg tells her sisters she loves them and looks forward to seeing them in Valhalla, and Atli shouts that Gorr can kiss her divine backside. The living darkness binding them promptly evaporates, unceremoniously dropping them to the ground as boulders containing confiscated weapons crashland around them. Frigg and Ellisiv arm themselves as Atli unsuccessfully tries to lift Thor the Avenger's Mjolnir, which to her dismay lifts into the air before plunging into the ground.\nAt the core of the Godbomb, Gorr presses Young Thor's face against the infant elder god's heart, stating that his death will baptize the Godbomb. Thor uses the last of his strength to bite out one of Gorr's eyeballs, Gorr instinctively flinging him out of the Godbomb. Young Thor crashlands next to Atli, who is brandishing his Jarnbjorn, and promptly takes it back. Atli protests and mocks Young Thor for not being worthy of Mjolnir yet, but he uses the divine axe to kill a Black Berserker as the monsters manifest and swarm the rioting gods. Thor the Avenger erupts from the Earth as King Thor rides a meteor back down to Gorr's dark world, but they are too late: a Black Berserker rips the heart out of a feline deity and delivers it to Gorr, who completes the Godbomb. As tendrils of living abyss blossom across the Godbomb, Thor the Avenger and King Thor plunge into it - Gorr greeting them at its core and triumphantly declaring his victory. King Thor furiously tackles Gorr, Thor the Avenger noting that Gorr already activated the bomb and asking what to do. King Thor tosses Thor the Avenger his Mjolnir, telling him to do what he always does and hit it with a hammer. Dual-wielding the Mjolnirs, Thor the Avenger strikes the Godbomb's core with all his strength, sending divine lightning surging through it, but his fears that Gorr had been right all along get the better of him and the Godbomb detonates before he can deal the finishing blow.\nGODBOMB - Part Four of Five\n• The penultimate chapter in the saga of the God Butcher.\n• Thus comes the final battle against Gorr, as three Thors lead an army of slave gods in the fight to save all of divinity."

Spider-Man finds the two villains have gathered with a third counterpart, K.M.O.O.D., and have loaded the anti-matter bomb into a device to detonate it. Spider-Man uses a web to yank the bomb's vial core out of it, and swings away. He manages to evade K.M.O.O.D and K.D.O.O.M., but M.O.D.O.K. blindsides the hero and blasts him away, making him drop the vial. Before Spider-Man plummets into the ground, he is saved byCaptain Marvel. She fights M.O.D.O.K. and K.D.O.O.M., and after defeating them she notices K.M.O.O.D. had retrieved the vial and went back to activate the bomb.

TheVisionappears and wrestles the vial out of K.M.O.O.D.'S hands, hurling the villain into a portal cast by Strange that leaves him stranded in a desert. Vision takes the vial to an Omega Flight station where Hank Pym is overseeing the activation of theConvergence Engines, which he hopes can reverse the Convergence. The device blasts a beam of energy into the colliding Earth. The chaos continues as the device is failing to synchronize, and the heroes assemble at the scene. Vision suggests using his density-altering powers in tandem with the Convergence Engines to bring the colliding worlds together more harmoniously. Taking the antimatter vial from an Omega Flight agent, Vision flies into the energy beam. Warning the heroes that the Earth will be born anew, he asks them to take care of it. Once Vision assimilated the vial, the energy beam becomes stronger and the two worlds are enveloped by purple lines as they are drawn closer, and a light flashes.\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nInHydramerica, anOscorpconvoy moves into a fortified Hydra Logistics Base.Captain Americadrops in, takes downHydrasentries and fights his way deeper into the base.

The alarms suddenly go off and the inmates run rampant. After defeating a group of inmates that engage her, Clubb deduces that if the prisoners' power inhibitors were turned off, that means someone has stolen the control codes for the facility, and that they need to reactivate them. Before that, Storm heads to the confinement ward and subdues a riot. Clubb then tells her that they have to send a distress signal to the command center from the deck's emergency communication system, but the agent stationed there appears to have been compromised. Storm finds the agent,Aidan Callahaninjured, and warns her that one of their worst inmates,Prisoner-28291, has locked the exit.

Together with Hank Pym, Tony makes use of an army of Ultron drones to run the city. However, as soon as Stark and Pym walk away from a group of Ultrons, the green lights of one unit glitch out and become red. Joining Nick Fury at the HQ's lookout, Stark acknowledges his part in it. They overlook an army of Ultrons, and Stark sends them away with a gesture of his arms. Tony rejoices in his accomplishment, but Fury shakes his head. As the group of Ultrons fly through the city, one changes its lights to red and stops in its tracks, breaking rank. Somewhere else,Kingpinbroods at his desk. He states that the city is built on lies. He claims that under his rule, he can make it flawless again, and smirks. The errant Ultron unit asserts that only together they can achieve their goal, perfection.\nBack at the Omega Flight Headquarters, Tony Stark explains the hero that they will need to head to New Stark City to run some tests. On their way to the hangar, the hero encounters Nick Fury. Fury tells them he has the gut feeling there is something wrong with the Ultrons, and asks them to report if they see anything unusual. Arriving at the Research Sector ofProject: P.E.G.A.S.U.S., the hero meets up with Tony Stark. He asks an Ultron unit to run a biometrics scan on the hero, but the Ultron doesn't respond. Stark asks the hero to track down the agent who sent this unit from the lab,Karissa Paine. When the hero reaches Paine at the Particle Lab, she explains she ran a full diagnostic on it earlier. The hero wonders if the Ultrons have ever attacked the people they're programmed to defend, and Paine reveals the units are incapable of attacking anyone who isn't registered on the city's main threat grid. To prove this, she commands Security Ultron 1968-07 to attack everybody in its sector. The lights on the robot glitch out, and it becomes violent, but the hero destroys it. Other Ultrons go rogue, and Paine attempts to activate their shutdown code, but it has no effect, and more violent Ultrons arrive. They are fended off by the hero and Omega Flight, and self-destruct after completing a data transfer.\nFury orders the hero to help Pym suspend all Ultron operations. Hank suddenly notices he has lost power to the main computer grid. The hero checks the generator control system, and it appears to be damaged. Pym asks the hero to retrieve and replace components necessary to get operations back on line, and the power to the main system is restored. However, the reboot sequence has activated several Ultron drones, and the hero has to destroy them since they can't be shut down remotely. Pym notices the batch of Ultrons that are resisting the shutdown code are targeting the base's power plant, and Hank theorizes their programming became corrupted when they rebooted. Pym warns the hero that if the power plant is destroyed, all Ultrons in the field will temporarily shut down and potentially become corrupted once they reboot. After destroying the Ultrons, the hero receives a call from Fury, warning him that while they were busy dealing with the Ultrons attacking the power plant, more of them took Pym hostage. While Nick tracks down Pym's captors, the hero destroys more Ultrons.\nAs the hero heads to the coordinates provided by Fury, Stark ask them if they can also grab datacores from Ultrons they take down and transmit their data back to him, since he thinks he has found a weakness in the Ultrons' programming. The hero retrieves six memory units, and Tony prepares to upload a virus to shut down the robots' entire network. In the meantime, he asks the hero to assist some agents that have requested backup. The hero helps the agents, and then heeds another backup request. Stark alerts the hero that the passage to the Ultron production facility has been blocked by Ultrons, and asks them to investigate while he finishes prepping the virus. The Ultrons besieging the facility notice the virus uploaded into them and initiate a self-destruct sequence in response, which could level the city. The hero fights the detonating Ultrons, and Stark sends a Quinjet that drops a device into the ground which shuts them down. Tony warns the hero there's one detonating Ultron that didn't blow up, and he can't hack into it to upload the virus either, and assumes it's the one holding Pym hostage.\nThe hero encountersAgent M, who simply reminds them that he can offer them recovery kits or materials to enhance their costumes.\nIk Hwanbrings the hero's attention toElisa Timmons. She explains she and her family left to a shelter as soon as the Ultrons started going rogue, but were too late and were attacked. Her husband brought them time to evacuate by leading the Ultrons away from them, and she asks the hero to find him. The hero defeats a group of Ultrons, saving Elisa's husband, Omega Flight agentMcDowell Hudson. He then leaves to rejoin his family at the shelter.\nThe hero stumbles intoDave Sanon, one of Omega Flight's dimensional record keepers in charge of collecting important artifacts from different dimensions. He's distraught because he accidentally activated a Midgardian object which teleported away all the artifacts the keeprs have collected. At Sanon's request, the hero helps him by finding his dimensional observation record, which had also been teleported away, so he can at least know what went missing.\nCitizenJohn Winnickinforms the hero he has designed a device that can shut down all Ultrons in a 50-meter radius, and intends to make a fortune with it. He asks the hero to help retrieve a prototype from his office, since Ultrons are blocking the way. When the hero approaches the building, it's being pummeled by a giant Ultron. Winnick laments as his work is gone, and so is his chance to be rich and famous.\nOmega Flight agentSkyla Moorewelcomes to hero to the Research Sector and tells them that they will have to go through a clearance process. She asks the hero to retrieve some data from a terminal and bring it toGeorge Cagleso they can get their registration data in return. When presented with the data, Cagle notices it's city records from the Convergence that he had asked Moore. Cagle explains that Moore has a habit of messing around with new agents and tricking them into doing her job for her.\nCagle decides to compensate for Moore's trick by giving the hero information that could prove useful for a new agent, and introduces them to the record management module where they can learn more about the known regions of the Primary Earth. When the hero tries the module, it denies them access. They talk toPhilbert Smith, who Cagle mentioned is in charge of the modules. Smith explains the Ultron attack has caused the systems to undergo maintenance, and they will be running up again as soon as possible.\nAbraham Richalerts the hero a group of Ultrons he had set on mode patrol left when he stepped out for a moment, and asks them to find them and take them down. The hero helps guard a checkpoint, and destroys the rogue robots.\nElla Macdonaldexplains that her Ultron assistant went haywire and joined a group of Ultrons causing a scene, taking with him some important data she had been working on all week. The hero retrieves the data after destroying the Ultron, and Ella asks them to upload it to the city's record keeping system. Afterward, Ella explains that the record keeping system regularly measures the concentration of Convergium in New Stark City to see if the Convergence Engines are controlling the concentration level properly.

He asks to deliver the data toTina McKnight, and she uploads the update file into her test Ultrons, which she deduces hasn't been affected because it's blocked from outside network connections.

To a daughter left behind by a parent on a quest. A parent who was there the day when the courage of Earth proved insufficient...\nNew York. Under a preternatural red sky, the world watches Exitar, Executioner for the Celestials, descend. In the streets, heroes combine their efforts to keep calm while geniuses try to build a stopgap. Hulk will hold Doctor Doom's forcefield generator in place as it protects the world. In low Earth orbit, a coalition of superhumans will delay the cosmic god, and everyone hopes the Avengers Unity Squad, who are outside the forcefield, can find a way to save the world.\nOn the Apocalypse Twin's Ark, Thor battles Eimin, who wields the axe Jarnbjorn. She poses the riddle that she will take from Kang the one thing he prizes the most, as revenge for what he did to the twins. Impossible as it seems, the fight is surprisingly even.\nIn the bowels of the ship, Eric Williams, the last of the Horsemen of Death, begs the Wasp to kill him, claiming it is the only way she can achieve victory. Just like Daken and Bob Reynolds before him, he incessantly monologues, claiming that the only way for the Wasp to become pertinent to the disaster she faces is the choice she judged Wolverine for: kill her opponent.\nOn Earth, the forcefield flares to life. Cosmic death is staved off. Hope rekindles. Thor claims Jarnbjorn to use as evidence to talk down Exitar... too late. In New York, casings crack, and the resulting explosion destroys the forcefield engine and the top of Avengers Tower. Exitar decends to Earth, as Eric Williams gloats. Captain America interrupts, giving the Wasp the time to go for the Tachyon Dam holding off time travel reinforcements.\nBut as Wasp struggles, Eric Williams uses his scythe to kill Captain America. On Earth, the Celestial causes untold destruction, as the Avengers admit that all their efforts were for nothing. As he has watched so many events, Uatu watches Exitar tear the planet apart, and the silence that follows.\nEimin returns to the Ark, gleeful at the destruction, answering her own riddle: They have robbed Kang of his prize. There is no longer an Earth for him to conquer.\nAs the shockwave of the destroyed Earth wracks the Moon, the Apocalypse Twin's Ark flies through space, and Thor creates a portal to elsewhere.\nHe finds himself in the space that Odin exiled himself to, to watch his brother's corpse. There, Odin bonds with his son over the tragedy of the Earth's destruction. However, the elder god is quick to point out that the Earth faced the same threshold all worlds eventually face: to unite against the unknown, becoming stronger... or to fall into argument and waste their strength in foolishness. The tragedy is that the humans chose the latter. Odin tells Thor that the death is not his fault, and walks away. Thor does not rise.\nThe conclusion of Ragnarök Now!\n• The Avengers Assemble! But are they too late?\n• The Twins’ revenge on Kang is complete, but at what cost?"

Viper soon realizes something is off as soon as Natasha discloses that she's planning to murderCaptain America. Natasha turns Viper's attention to her unsanctioned narcotics operation, pondering what Rogers would do if he learned of it. Natasha then offers Viper the chance to join her enterprise in exchange of keeping her dealings under wraps. She additionally pointing out that Rogers' death could provide Viper the opportunity to take the reins of Hydra once more. Viper gives in, kills her two escorts, and agrees to help Natasha. Meanwhile, the Champions break into a secure room using an access code and a hand scan taken from Viper.Ironheartcomments how Natasha stated they'd find a person that would win them the war, who turns out to be a fragile old man in a hospital bed.Falcondoubts that they've found the person they're looking for, but Natasha assures him that they have.\nIn the mysterious forest, Steve Rogers has continued his journey accompanied by the two strangers he met previously, whom he has now befriended.\nAboard theUnderground's transport,Ant-Manis sending his daughterCassieupdates on their quest for theCosmic Cubefragments, recounting their visit to theSavage Land. Their next stop isWakanda, where he expects they'll get the shard with ease. However, when theTony Stark A.I.has a hearing withBlack Panther, T'Challa denies him the fragment, arguing that because the shard came to Wakanda, it's rightfully theirs. When Black Panther rejects Tony's claims that he'll fix the situation, Stark remarks that unlike them, Hydra will not stop raiding Wakanda until they get the fragment. Black Panther makes a counteroffer, proposing Tony to surrender all of the shards when they finish collecting them. Stark refuses and walks away.\nScott's recount continues, revealing the later days of their quest saw the heroes come out empty handed, following adventures which involved fighting theHigh Evolutionaryand breaking into vaults. Now inMadripoor, the Underground makes their way through an army ofHandninja being controlled byHive. The enemies are taken down as soon as Iron Man knocks out Hive, leaving onlyGorgonstanding. While severely hurt,Herculeslunges him, and manages to knock him down before being turned into stone. Iron Man prepares to freeShang-Chi, the prisoner of Hydra and supposed owner of a fragment. However, he reveals he doesn't possess it anymore, and he can't even remember who stole it. Cue a flashback showingEmma Frosttaking the fragment from an unconscious Shang-Chi. In light of another failure,Sam Wilsonholds a vote to decide whether to continue or return toThe Mount, making emphasis on the previous six dead ends they encountered over the past weeks. Iron Man concedes when most of his teammates agree to desist, but remarks that they're not only giving up on a mission, but also on Steve Rogers.\nIn Washington, D.C., Captain America meets up withNew TianambassadorBeastin the site whereMjolnirlays still. When Beast wonders why did he leave the hammer there, Steve answers the weapon's inscription states \"whosoever,\" so anybody is welcome to try to pick it up. Rogers gets to the point of their meeting, revealing that Kraken has reported New Tian is in possession of something that belongs to them, implying the Cube fragment. When Beast asks for a clarification, Steve turns to Mjolnir, hinting at the destruction he could bring to New Tian with it. Hank questions if Steve is threatening him, and Rogers denies the accusation, simply explaining that he wants Hank to remember his compassion and spare his people of destruction. A helicopter lands on the scene, and as Captain America proceeds to leave, Beast wonders how difficult must it be for him to resist the urge to pick up Mjolnir and play god. Steve replies that's hardly the case, as he doesn't need the hammer for that.\nAboard the helicopter,Madame Hydragives Steve an update on Hydra'sAvengers.Scarlet Witchremains inChthon's control, though slightly unhinged; the virus designed byArnim Zolacontinues keepingVisionunder Hydra's control, with occasional attempts to break free. As forOdinson, he's praying toOdin, sharing his troubles. While aware of the evil posed by Hydra's regime, they have promised him the chance to saveJane Fosterfrom the alternate dimension where she has been left stranded, as well as the restoration of Midgard's connection to Asgard. Furthermore, he's confused by Rogers' ability to wield Mjolnir, even when he couldn't. Now aboard a Hydra Helicarrier, Madame Hydra comments she andDoctor Faustushas tried to subvert Odinson to no avail, as he's still a god. Steve prepares to leave, but not before Elisa shows her support for him once again, commenting that even if she could never replace his mother, Elisa has always regarded him as a son.\nIron Man's team eventually returns to The Mount. After reuniting with the rest of the Underground, they giveHawkeyethe news that their mission was unsuccessful, much to his dismay. Iron Man returns to his lab, and encountersGiant-Mantrying to build a time capsule, which he intends to bury, so in the far future when Hydra's regime eventually falls, it can send a warning to the past. WhenShaun Lucasturns the conversation to the result of the mission, Giant-Man and Iron Man reveal that in reality they never had a Cosmic Cube-tracking device, and were simply followingRick Jones' best leads. He had pretended the search was going to be precise so to foster hope. Tony is interrupted when he detects hostiles and rushes to get the base's shields up, all whileMockingbirdsneakily contactssomebodythrough a communicator. In the horizon, thee Hydra Helicarriers appear and open fire on the base. Zola notes that according to their intel, the blasts won't be enough to bring down their defenses, so Captain America prepares to unleash their secret weapon.\nBack in the mysterious forest, Steve Rogers and his allies are walking through a path when he notices a set of wires. He can't warn one of his companions in time, who steps on it, causing a net to swoop him away. The other man is taken out by a poisoned dart. Before he can properly react, Steve is knocked down from behind with a club. The attacker reveals himself to be theRed Skull, though he claims he's Rogers' salvation, and that he'll free Steve from this place.\nBack inside the Hydra Helicarrier, Zola walks Captain America to the door of a vault, commenting that their subject is awake but disoriented, and that whichever procedure they've done is only temporary, which will cause his condition to degrade quickly. Rogers brushes off Zola's concerns, guaranteeing they only need their subject for a short time to bring down the Underground. As the doors of the vault open, the person revealed to be on the other side is none other thanBruce Banner."

As the symbiote-dragon's body destabilizes behind them, Dani notes that there are millions more and they need a new plan, Hildegarde agreeing and asking Jane if she has one. Jane replies thatBrunnhildecame up with one, to Hilde's astonishment.\nInVanaheim, the Unnamed Valkyrie massacres the monstersKing Vanlandibrought to kill her and reclaimsJarnbjorn. Taking Vanlandi captive, she helps herself to theFort of Gaardar's massive pantry; brushing asideMr. Horseadmonishing her that they need to rejoin the fight as soon as possible. Recalling what it was like being trapped inside the undeadCelestial's twisted afterlife, she explains it would scour her memories to torture her but that she got used to it and was even comforted by the endless repetition. Noting that at first she left messages to herself promising to fight and/or escape, she ultimately never did so and is afraid that if she returns she'll prove herself a coward by willingly embracing the nightmare again.\nIn Midgard, Hildegarde incredulously asks if Jane is serious when she says that two of them need to fight the Headless Celestial in the Realm Between while the third picks a fight withKnull. Jane says she is, and that severing theAll-Black symbiote's connection to the Headless Celestial is paramount. Hildegarde volunteers herself for the task of fighting Knull, noting that she prefers the living world to the afterlife. Dani interjects asking how she can help when she doesn't haveValkyriepowers anymore, but Jane explains thatBrightwindwill take her to the Realm Between, where time has no meaning, and that she will be all that she ever was and ever will be. Dani laments not being able to make Knull understand the value of life, noting that if they could only convince him than countless lives on both sides would be spared. As Dani bemoans that power often brings arrogance and ignorance, Jane agrees that their battle is wasteful. Noting an approaching symbiote-dragon, Hildegarde asks if they can draw it off for her. Jane and Dani distract the monster long enough for Hildegarde to leap onto its back and then port to the Realm Between, the symbiote-dragon letting out a shriek of anger at its prey escaping.  Hidden on the symbiote-dragon's back, Hildegarde chuckles at the thought of keeping it as her Valkyrie mount.\nInValhalla, Brunnhilde watches her fellow Valkyrie-turned-Einherjartraining and laments that she cannot enjoy the afterlife as they do. Distracted by her concerns for the world of the living and wanting to help, she approaches Ivanir - an elderly goddess weaving a mystical tapestry depictingalternate timelines and continuitiesthat will never come to pass. As Ivanir greets her, Brunnhilde says she's come to seek advice and that Jane Foster has gone to fight the Headless Celestial. Pausing, Ivanir replies that Jane Foster will die but is taken aback when Brunnhilde retorts that she told Jane about the ritual needed to sever the Headless Celestial's connection to All-Black. Ivanir angrily scolds her for meddling in the affairs of the living and messing with ancient forces beyond their comprehension, but Brunnhilde retorts that she felt she had no other choice and that a fight with the dead should be fought by the dead.\nIn the Realm Between, Jane and Dani - who is now clad in ancient Asgardian armor - pull out a needle-shaped golden sword capable of piecing the fabric of reality. The two Valkyries initiate the ritual by weaving a lattice that cuts through the space-time continuum. As Jane throws the needle down to Midgard, she hopes Hildegarde will be able to intercept it;  Dani agreeing and stating that Knull will sense what is happening and try to prevent it.\nOn Midgard, Hildegarde dismounts from the symbiote-dragon and lands amidst fleeing civilians. As she confronts the symbiote-controlledStorm, Hildegarde thinks to herself that if she can do her part to stop Knull then she can die knowing her life had meaning, and that the war on Midgard has no shortage of warrior's deaths. As Storm blasts a civilian with lightning, Hildegarde tackles him aside and lunges with her sword drawn, thinking to herself that she can't die just yet.\nIn Vanahiem, the Unnamed Valkyrie drunkenly slumps against Mr. Horse and happily raises a goblet of wine. As Mr. Horse admonishes her for procrastinating, the Unnamed Valkyrie tells him to let her enjoy being alive for the first time in millennia. Sobering, she tells him that the souls trapped in the Headless Celestial would whisper secrets to her, one of which was that in her long absenceThor Odinsontook up Jarnbjorn and augmented it with his divine blood, making it capable of cleaving through even the nigh-impenetrable armor of the Celestials. Examining her reflection in the axe's blade, the Unnamed Valkyrie says that she thought reclaiming it would restore her resolve; Mr. Horse replying that only small men look for courage in big weapons. As the Unnamed Valkyrie replies that she'll just drink her fears away, Mr. Horse interrupts stating that he was born in theFort of Gaardar. The Unnamed Valkyrie sarcastically retorts that Mr. Horse being of proud Vanir stock far superior to the posh ponies of Asgard might have come up a few times, but Mr. Horse retorts that Vanaheim is a place of divination and that the Unnamed Valkyrie may very well find a portent of the future at the bottom of her goblet of ale. The Unnamed Valkyrie protests that the only thing that's there is darkness, Mr. Horse sombrely agreeing that that's what awaits them.\nOn Midgard, Storm overpowers Hildegarde and slams her into a symbiote-covered building, Hildegarde lamenting having picked her fights poorly. Breaking free of Storm's grasp and knocking her to the ground, Hildegarde initially despairs that she has no way of winning until the divine needle plunges from the sky and she grabs ahold of it. Recalling Mattis' telling her that when the time came for her to die she'd accept her death with joy knowing she did all that she could, Hildegarde notes that at the time she'd retorted she'd fight to her last breath in a berserker rage but that he'd been right. As Storm blasts her with a torrent of lightning, Hildegarde hurls the needle at Knull - the divine weapon looping its golden thread around the tether of darkness connecting his Necrosword to the Headless Celestial. As the ocean of living abyss engulfs her, Hildegarde thinks to herself that Mattis had been right, and that in the end all she can feel is love.\nTHE NEW VALKYRIE FINDS HER WEAPON — WILL IT BE ENOUGH?"

Steve remains confused, as he somehow remembers the kid, and asks her if she's lost like he is. Kobik answers that she's not, and walks Steve out of the forest, showing him the ruins ofPleasant Hill. She then turns to him, and, as her eyes begin to glow, tells him to remember.\nAbove theWhite House, aboard a Hydra Helicarrier, Supreme LeaderSteve Rogersis approached byBaron Zemo, who brings him theBlack Pantheras a prisoner. After vowing to take revenge on Zemo, T'Challa is taken away by guards. Zemo subsequently leaves when Steve orders him awaken \"the army that sleeps.\" Rogers is then alerted of the arrival of three new guests,Emma Frost,BeastandShawfromNew Tian. When a subordinate informs Rogers the High Council has advised to move their base ship out of range due to an ongoing battle nearby, Rogers shuts down the suggestion, ensuring he is where he wants to be.\nRight outside, by theWashington Monument, an all-out fight is taking place between Hydra and the superheroes.Alpha Flight, theAvengers Unity Division, theDefenders, theGuardians of the Galaxy, theUndergroundand many more, all led bySam Wilson, have joined forces to defeat Hydra once and for all. Heavy hittersHyperionandStar Brandjoin the brawl, as well asSpider-Man, theU.S.Avengers, andEuroforce. Unfortunately, so doHydra's own Avengersand the High Council itself on Hydra's side.\nAboard the Hydra Helicarrier, Frost attempts to convince Rogers to keep Hydra's deal with New Tian, to the extent she has already surrendered the Cosmic Cube fragment whose secret presence in New Tian had irked Rogers. When Rogers refuses, essentially declaring war, Frost reminds him she had promised no mutant would kneel to Hydra, a sentiment she expressesMagnetoshares. Flying outside the Helicarrier, the Master of Magnetism attacks the vessel with giant shards of metal. While Frost, Beast and Shaw are occupied fighting Rogers' guards,Zolaconvinces the Supreme Leader to flee, notifying Rogers that all but one of the fragments is enough to weaponize what they have of the Cosmic Cube.\nBack to the fight outside, even as theX-Menjoin the efforts against Hydra, many of the heroes find themselves overpowered by Hydra's Avengers and the High Council. Witnessing his former friends in peril,Odinsondeclares he has seen enough and summons a thunder to strike down the forces of Hydra.\nHaving heard the consequence of Odinson's change of heart from aboard one of the Helicarriers,TaskmasterconvincesBlack Antto switch to the winning side for convenience. They turn to the cell holding theChampionsprisoners, and decide to let them free as long as they put in a good word for them. The young heroes agree, thoughSpider-Manimmediately webs up both of them before leaving.\nWhen the Champions join the fight,Viv's presence gives theVisiona moment of freewill, which she uses to purge Zola's A.I. virus from his body, spreading it to theDreadnoughtssurrounding them, shutting down the robots.Doctor StrangeconfrontsChthonand summons a portal that brings backThorfrom the alien dimension. Thor knocks out the villain before reverting to her fragile human form of Jane Foster. Strange prepares to cast out Chthon fromScarlet Witch's body while Sam Wilson flies away with Dr. Foster in order to retrieveMjolnir.\nBack aboard the Hydra Helicarrier, Baron Zemo prepares to awaken the members of the Army of Evil, who had been in stasis ever since Hydra's take-over, all while Black Panther is still being escorted prisoner. The two soldiers are suddenly knocked out by theWinter Soldier, who jumps down from the ceiling on Zemo. Baron Zemo subdues Bucky, but T'Challa strangles him from behind using the chains that shackle his hand, and then knocks him out.\nInsideDoctor Faustus' office, the hypnotist has managed to take control ofSharon Carter, whom he orders to serve him tea. Carter soon reveals she's not actually under Faustus' control, with his tea being poisoned with a non-lethal toxin. After knocking out Faustus with a punch, Sharon explains that ever since he had taken control of her to assassinate Steve Rogers, she constantly listened to recordings of his voice to build up an immunity to it. With Faustus unconscious, Sharon focuses her attention on using the passwords she knew from Steve to shut down the remaining Hydra warships. Meanwhile, Black Panther attempts to sneak up on Rogers and Zola, but finds the latter being outfitted withan armorderived fromStark techthat allows him to harness the power of what they have of the Cosmic Cube.\nBack to the ruins of Pleasant Hill, Steve walks down the streets of the town with Kobik, recalling the life he had forgotten, up until the moment Kobik saved him from his death at the hands ofCrossbones, and realizing that all of the people he encountered in the forest were people he knew. When Steve mentions he still has no idea where he is, Kobik directs him to a glowing fountain in the middle of the park, where Steve sees scenes of the things his Hydra-loyalist self has done. Discouraged, Steve realizes all this time he's been inside Kobik's mind, and that he himself is a memory of the Steve Rogers he once was. When Steve asks Kobik to make him real again, she runs away declaring she can't and that it's too late. The ground below Steve's feet begins to rumble.\nIn Washington, the remaining Hydra Helicarriers shut down and crash into the ground. As they continue stomping their enemies, the heroes enjoy themselves, being finally united after so long. However, Black Panther runs towards the heroes, warning them to run. A sudden blasts knocks down the fighters, and the armored Captain America appears in the steps of theCapitol Building."

She's aided by Odinson, Freyja, and a small army of women Odinson thought were potential candidates for the new Thor's secret identity.  Cul relays what's going on through his fleshly body to Odin, who doesn't respond to his brother's questions on what course of action he should take.\nBack at Roxxon, Thor tells Odinson that he shouldn't have brought his allies to her fight. Odinson demands that she tell him her true identity and he'd let her be, but she refuses. Thor attacks the Destroyer with Jarnbjorn, only to be blasted by the walking armor. Freyja stabs the Destroyer in the face, declaring that the only thing that will die is her husband's supposed omnipotence, reasserting her title as the All-Mother of Asgard. Cul takes affront at her insubordination and grabs her by the throat. Freyja addresses Odin through the Destroyer, demanding to know if he sees what he has wrought. Reluctantly, Odin calls Cul off.\nThe ladies bid Thor farewell, and Thor and Odinson are left alone. Thor begins to tell him about Malekith the Accursed and Dario Agger working together when Odinson interrupts her, stating that he knows she's Agent Roz Solomon. Thor tells him they have more important matters to discuss, but Odinson insists he needs to know her true identity.  He offers to tell her the words that Nick Fury told him that made him unworthy of Mjolnir, in exchange for her secret. Suddenly, to his surprise, Solomon appears in her flying car. Disembarking, she accuses Thor of blowing her operation with her conspicuous entrance. As Solomon turns to address Odinson, Thor takes her cue to leave. Flabbergasted that he was wrong, Thor tears up the list and asks Solomon for a ride to the nearest mead hall, promising to pay for drinks.\nOn Asgardia, Freyja is refused entry into the throne room, as Odin wants to be alone.\nOn Jotunheim, Malekith, Agger, and the Frost Giants gather together around Laufey's skull.  Malekith casts ice-magic empowered with the blood of a hundred Light Elves to resurrect Laufey.\nMeanwhile, Thor covertly returns to Asgardia and sends Mjolnir away until its needed again. She mentally reminds herself that no one can know her secret identity, as the world needs a Thor who knows what it means to be mortal.  As her costume dissolves, she collapses to the floor, and Thor's true identity as Jane Foster is revealed.\n•  The final battle with the Destroyer!\n• Guest stars galore!\n• A shocking return!"

The four Thors arrive at Stonehenge to rescueOdinandFreyja, and engage Malekith, who has bonded to theVenom symbiote, as well as his forces. Meanwhile, theGod Tempestmanifests in the Sun. Daredevil falls down to Laufey, but before that he throwsHofunddown the villain's throat.\nAs the fight continues, the storm rains fire down to Earth, weakening the symbiote. Thor reveals he had been wielding the God Tempest to reforge Mjolnir, which makes landfall next to him. Sharing his new understanding of his worthiness, Thor lifts the hammer and delivers a knocking hit to Malekith. With her Mjolnir about to crack, Jane sends it flying to Manhattan to deliver a blow to Laufey. After that,Lokicarves his way out of his father's stomach using Hofund, revealing his survival. Malekith attempts to stand up against the victorious Thors, but his own beasts sense his fear and rip him apart. When Ultimate Mjolnir comes back to Jane as she returns to her human form, the shards of the hammer converge on her and morph intoa golden bracelet, leaving her perplexed.\nHeimdall notices the blooming fruits of Malekith's defeat across the realms and the slow return of peace. Odin shares a moment with Thor, expressing his pride in his son. He steps down as King of Asgard, and bestows the title of All-Father upon Thor.\nPinned to the newYggdrasil,Thor Odinsonsacrifices his left eye to the World Tree for the knowledge to defeatMalekith, but it's not enough. He begs Yggdrasil not to take the last shard ofMjolnir, but reluctantly allows the tree's stellar flames to claim it. In return, Yggdrasil grants him a way to stop Malekith: find more Thors.\nBillions of years in the future,Frigg Wodendottirreads these events from a book to her sistersAtliandEllisiv, the latter noting that they now know how their grandfather lost his eye and grumbling that she can't believe he never told them this tale before. Atli asks what happened next, Frigg incredulously responding that Thor's \"fantastic allies\" travelled through time to the distant future in order to retrieve an old ally. As soon as she finishes reading this, a time-portal opens andReed Richardsand theThingstep through. Before theGoddesses of Thundercan attack the intruders,All-Father Thorgreets the two Fantastic Four members and says he's been waiting for this day for millennia.\nInthe present, the present-day Thor Odinson and All-Father Thor stand in the ruins ofAsgard. The Present Day Thor explains the situation with Malekith to his future self, saying they need more Thors to defeat Malekith. Recalling their battle againstGorr the God-Butcher, All-Father Thor agrees - noting that with his missing eye, prosthetic arm, and beard Present Day Thor is starting to resemble him. As the Young Thor from the ninth century approaches and boasts that he's ready for battle, All-Father Thor laments the return of his youngest self. As his older and younger selves bicker, Present Day Thor tries to get them to stop arguing by reminding them that they did great things working together.Jane Fosteragrees, revealing she has regained her Thor powers by claiming Ultimate Mjolnir - though it is unstable and trying to tear itself apart again. The Thor Corps set out to take down Malekith, while on Midgard their allies continue to fight Malekith's forces.\nInManhattan,Iron Man, thePunisher,Hulk,Logan, andSpider-Mancombat the last ofLaufey'sFrost Giants. As a Frost Giant roars that they'll never take Midgard back,Captain Marvelcrash-landsQueen Sindrbehind him and decapitates him with theTwilight Sword, asking where Laufey is. Confronting the Frost Giant King alongsideBlack Panther,Lady Sif, and the Thing,Captain Americatells Laufey to surrender as his allies have been defeated. Sneering that he never had any allies, Laufey pulls out theCasket of Ancient Wintersand eats it. His powers immeasurably augmented, Laufey exhales a torrent of cold air that threatens to freeze the heroes of Midgard solid. Protected byHofund's divine magic,Daredevilchallenges Laufey in the name of Hell's Kitchen.\nAt Stonehenge,Malekithhears the Thor Corps approaching and augments his acolytes with theVenom symbiote- bonding to it and manifesting aNecroswordin emulation ofKnulland Gorr.Freyjatells Malekith that he's lost the war and should flee while he still can, but the dark elf warlord cheerfully states that theWar of the Realmswas his proudest accomplishment, eclipsed only by the impending death of Thor. As Freyja despairs and asks what gods they can pray to,Odintells her to pray to Thor, making a maudlin joke that their son probably won't hear her over the thunder. The Thor Corps arrives, Malekith expressing surprise at the existence of multiple Thors. Manifesting wings of living abyss, Malekith declares himself to be the Butcher of Thors and dubs his Necrosword the Venom Blade and Symbio Sword - telling his Spider-Elf acolytes andWild Huntto kill Thor's parents. The Thor Corps divvy up their opponents between them and lunge into battle.\nIn Manhattan, Daredevil's divine blood turns to slush as the Casket of Eternal Winters-augmented Laufey boasts of his supremacy. Daredevil throws Hofund, rebounding the divine sword off walls of ice, but Laufey catches the blade with his teeth and eats it. As Laufey exhales a blizzard to blanket all of Midgard,Screwbeardthe dwarf despairs butSir Ivory Honeyshotthe light elf senses a glimmer of hope: in space, theGod Tempestmanifests and wreathes the Sun in divine lightning, imbuing itself with stellar plasma.\nAt Stonehenge, All-Father Thor berates Young Thor for his recklessness, since his death would erase him and Present-Day Thor from the timeline; Young Thor complaining about his nagging. Freyja and Odin berate Jane for taking up the mantle of Thor again, Odin telling her that if she dies he won't be able to resurrect her again. Wielding Jarnbjorn and the Last Hammer of Asgard, Thor engages Malekith; but the symbiote-augmented dark elf recalls the time he lopped off Thor's arm with his own axe. Snaring Thor's hammer, Malekith coats it in living abyss and dubs it the Black Hammer of the Accursed. Before Malekith can kill Present-Day Thor, Jane intercepts his attack with Ultimate Mjolnir - Malekith retaliating by trying to impale her with his prehensile tongue and noting that her weapon's instability means it can only withstand a single throw. As Young Thor and All-Father Thor sensing the approaching God Tempest, Present-Day Thor taps into the berserker rage and recklessly throws himself at Malekith, but Malekith repels Thor and boasts that all the thunderbolts of a thousand Thors couldn't stop him.\nIn Manhattan, Sif and Captain America defend the wounded Daredevil, who whispers for Thor to wield the Storm of Storms. Present-Day Thor snaps that his older self telling him to \"wield the storm\" isn't being helpful, catching Malekith's hammer and saying that all he'll need to finish the dark elf warlord off is a good hard rain. As the God Tempest reaches Earth, it begins to rain ice and fire - Ivory Honeyshot telling Screwbeard that this was how life began and that something new is about to be born. Malekith scoffs at it raining fire, but Thor reminds him that symbiotes are weak to it. As hisSpider Elvesignite, Malekith watches in horror as the God Tempest convalesces into a reforged Mjolnir. As Malekith stammers that Thor isn't worthy, Thor replies that it's the unending struggle to become worthy that counts and declares himself the God of the Unworthy, lifting the reforged Mjolnir. With a single blow, Thor separates Malekith from the Venom symbiote, Jane congratulating Thor on his victory. Noting that Malekith was right that Ultimate Mjolnir only has one last throw left in it, Jane states she knows just who to use it on.\nAs Laufey triumphantly declares the dawn of a new Age of Giants, Ultimate Mjolnir smashes into his head and knocks out one of his eyes. As Laufey furiously demands to know who threw it, a gash opens up in his chest asLokicarves his way out of his father's stomach using Hofund, and emerges with the Casket of Ancient Winters - holding his dismembered and half-digested body together with magic.\nYoung Thor lops off Malekith's arm, the dark elf warlord projecting false bravado and declaring he only needs one hand to kill the Thors. Present Day Thor urges Malekith to surrender, telling him that the War of the Realms is over, but Malekith desperately states that the war can never end or everything that he's lost and suffered for will have been for nothing. Malekith commands his Wild Hunt to tear the Thor Corps apart, Thor urging him to stop since his fear has broken his control over them. Shouting that he has no fear, Malekith repeats his command - oblivious to his bog tiger and remaining hounds eyeing him ravenously. As Malekith laughs, his bog tiger bites down on his remaining arm and takes off, the hounds ripping off his legs.\nAs the heroes of Midgard celebrate the end of the war, the Punisher leaves to resume his one-man war on crime and Daredevil laments the loss of his divine powers. The Venom symbiote returns to its humanoid form, noting that Malekith's dark magic actually helped fix its mental instability and that it has to prepare forthe coming Carnage. Ultimate Mjolnir crumbles as Jane Foster bids it farewell, but as she sadly returns to human form the shards of the hammer converge on her and morph intoa golden vambrace that covers her arm. Young Thor and All-Father Thor bond over their mutual love of alcohol - the latter promising to show the former the wonders of craft beer. As peace returns to the Ten Realms, Odin expresses pride in his son and steps down as King of Asgard, bestowing the title of All-Father upon Thor.\nTHE WORLD'S SHATTERING CONCLUSION OF WAR OF THE REALMS!"

Her most pressing task, though, is to defeat the Olympian godHerculesin an arm wrestling competition in a bar inChelsea: should he win, he'd be allowed to kiss her; should she win, Hercules and the other Olympians would fight alongside her. The match is suddenly taken to an end by theOdinson, who smashes their table with his axe and urges Thor toAsgardiawith him, for he needs to show her something. By the way, Hercules agrees to help Thor in her fight even though the fight hasn't technically seen a winner.\nIn Asgardia, Odinson shows Thor what is left ofVolstagg, in a comatose state afterhis fightwithMangoginOld Asgard. Odinson explains who the threat is to Thor, who'd only heard of it in \"whispers\", and as she says she's ready to face this new menace too, Odinson actually urges her to take time from thehammerand undergo her treatments for her cancer. Thor seems to be convinced, as she throws the hammer away and turns to her human form, but she has different intentions.\nJane walks towardsOdin's Castle, calling him a coward for staying hidden inside of it instead of facing the problems at hand and considering that maybe it would be better to find a new all-father or, rather,all-mother. She then addresses the Asgardians, saying that they need to fight alongside the populations of theNine Realmsso that the war may end. Her speech is cut short byCul, Odin's brother and current regent of Asgard, who reports a sedition going on. Jane, Odinson and the other Asgardians stand up to him, though, causing Odin himself to thrust the doors of his Castle open and intervene. He first addresses his brother, reprimanding him for his incompetence, but then he turns on Jane, saying she andher raceare \"the most arrogant fleas to ever infest the cosmos\". He concludes by saying he won't be lectured by her or anyone else, as he's the All-Father and thus his will must be followed. Suddenly,Freyjashows up, awakened from her deathly slumber by Jane's words: she says the human is right and that the Asgardians need to follow her. As the All-Mother speaks so, Jane collapses to the ground.\nAt theBifrost,Heimdalldeclares that he has seen many a war and the destruction of entire galaxies, but also that what is about to happen will be difficult to watch for him, too: in front of him stands the monstruous Mangog, ready to kill all the Gods in his path.\nTHE DEATH OF THE MIGHTY THOR Part 3"

Maiming and crucifying Thor, Gorr laments that for the first time in eons he was finally at peace in a world without gods... only to be unceremoniously resurrected byKing Loki.\nTurning to Loki, Gorr contemptuously asks if the embodiment of everything he hates about deities has any lies for him, but Loki instead offers up the remnants of All-Black still bonded to him. Thor protests that Gorr will kill Loki too, but Gorr silences him and replies that Loki is likely well-aware of that. Smirking, Gorr acknowledges Loki as a fellow butcher despite his divinity, Loki replying that they'll have to compare body counts and discuss the minutia of genocide at a later point. Chuckling, Gorr crucifies Loki and tells Thor that the God of Lies resurrected him because - even after eons of hatred and enmity - he wasn't sure he'd be able to go through with killing his own brother. As Gorr dismisses Loki as a cowardly child on the inside and sadistically asks if they should find out what All-Father Thor looks like on the inside, All-Father Thor retaliates by blasting Gorr with a beam ofThor-Force, sending him into orbit.\nBreaking free of his crucifix, Thor commands Loki to stand and fight alongside him, but Loki remains hanging from his crucifix and morosely remarks that Gorr lied about why he'd resurrected him. Thor angrily grumbles that he'll do everything himself like he always has - summoningMjolnirfrom theabyss-blackenedSun- deviating through the ruins ofAsgardand snagging theOdinsword. Surmising that Loki resurrected Gorr because he wasn't sure he could go through with killing him, Thor snaps that Loki needs to show him more than faint glimmers of hope for redemption; adding that if Loki refuses to help him then he'll kill Gorr himself and come back to do what Loki couldn't - kill his brother. As Thor takes off in pursuit of Gorr, Loki chuckles before letting out a maniacal laugh.\nIn orbit, Gorr recalls how he'd died and blames the betrayal of his \"family\" on the gods, recalling the disparate pieces of All-Black to himself. As Thor arrives, shouting that Gorr should have stayed dead and will now suffer the wrath ofAsgard; Gorr manifests All-Black as a colossal double-bladed sword he calls \"Annihilablade the Planet Cleaver,\" sneering that he should have saved himself a lot of pain and trouble and just let time dispose of all the gods before finishing Thor off.\nLightyears away, the \"Necro-Ravens\" harrying theGoddesses of Thundersuddenly depart -Friggwondering if it's a good sign andAtlilamenting that her petstarshark,Death Mouth, is disappointed. As Frigg suggests they turn back,Ellisivconsults theSaga of the God Butcherand notes thatShadrakhad told them to go back to the beginning. Asking her sisters how this saga began, Frigg reminds them that eons ago Thor hadonce been called to a planet by a prayer-the same planetthey are now approaching.\nOn New Midgard, Loki snaps at a praying human to shut up and let him die in peace. As the human asks if he's praying right, Loki rebukes him - saying that regardless of whether or not he's praying right there are no gods left to answer them and that soon they will all be dead. As the human says he will pray for Loki as well, Loki angrily tells him to stop and that it's the end of everything.\nElsewhere in the cosmos, Gorr and Thor clash - their battle shattering entire planets. Recognizing the solar system as one with three dying stars, Thor decides to use them to immolate Gorr and rebuild the cosmos from his ashes. Merging the suns into one massive orb of plasma, Thor launches it at Gorr. Effortlessly cleaving through it, Gorr sneers that he likes Thor's plan and remarks that he's finally realized his mistake in thinking that eliminating the gods would cause the mortals to realize they no longer need divinity.\nGorr cocoons Thor with a glob of living abyss and the moldering bones of the mortals who inhabited the shattered worlds, sneering that the gods have leftthe universea charnel house. Grabbing a bone and snapping it, Gorr declares his intent to butcher all life in the universe - starting with Thor's precious Midgard - and create it anew; self-sufficient with no need for godly guidance. Snapping that watching his creations flourish with no idea of the old gods who had existed before would be the ultimate repudiation of Thor, Gorr grabs him and sneers that deep down Thor knows he's right.\nBefore Gorr can finish Thor off, a golden lasso snares him by the neck, Loki snapping that he didn't resurrect Gorr so that he could kill Thor. Trying to strangle the God of God Butchers, Loki states that he's been longing to kill Thor since he was an infant and dismisses Gorr as a bow-legged caveman who found a magic rock. Gorr furiously severs Loki's right arm and encases him in All-Black, remarking that he now understands - the life Loki couldn't bear to take wasn't Thor's, but his own. Gorr mocks and blinds Loki, slowly constricting him, but Thor bashes him away.\nAs Thor checks on his brother, Loki quips that Gorr will regret not cutting out his tongue as well before telling Thor to get away while he has the chance, admitting that he'd intended to kill Thor himself and then die by Gorr's hand. As Loki despairs, Thor tries to rekindle his brother's fighting spirit by saying that he's beaten Gorr and countless other butchers like him before. Engulfing them in All-Black, Gorr sneers that there are no other butchers like him, declaring that he transcended mortality long ago. Still refusing to categorize himself as a god, Gorr instead declares himself a force of nature akin to an ocean and tells Thor to drown.\nSinking into the All-Black, Thor struggles and calls out to Loki, who snaps at Thor to leave him to die, and better yet to die alongside him. Thor tries to restore Loki's fighting spirit one last time by telling him that he'd lied aboutFreyjahaving given up on him and that she'd died saying that one day Loki would save them all. Reaching out to his estranged brother, Thor apologizes for having failed everyone. Their hands nearly connect, but as they both lose consciousness they drift apart and are lost to the darkness.\nIT’S THE BATTLE FORETOLD FOR CENTURIES:\nTHOR VS. LOKI IN THE FINAL FIGHT OF THE MILLENNIA!"

Thor has just defeated a Frost Giant that had terrorized the inhabitants of a local village. Thor is enjoying the village's food, ale and women when he is suddenly interrupted by a shriek. The shriek is from a little girl who claims to have found a \"devil man\" in the water. Thor and the others go to investigate and find the severed head of a Native American. Thor tells them that he head belongs to a slain god. The villagers question what could have done this to a god since he has been butchered and not attacked by a beast. Thor dismisses their concerns, telling them that whatever it was is no match for him and orders a funeral pyre built for the dead god.\nIn the present day, a little girl on the planet Indigarr prays to Thor for rain on her barren world. Thor appears and conjures a great rainstorm and breaks the ground, revealing underground water currents. Thor is invited to feast with the little girl's people and tells them stories of the wonders of Asgard. After the festivities, Thor asks one of the elders why the little girl did not pray to their own gods. The elder informs Thor that Indigarr does not have any gods. When Thor questions this, the elder tells him that there are old stories about gods from long ago who lived in the sky but that no one believes those stories anymore. Thor goes to investigate and finds a palace in the sky. He searches the many rooms but finds no sign of life. After entering a room with a chained door, he finds the corpses of all the gods of Indigarr. He notes that since godlfesh rots slowly, they've been dead for hundreds of years and whoever did this took great pleasure in the act. Thor is attacked by a lizard-like creature and suddenly realizes that the killer of these gods is Gorr the God Butcher, someone he faced over 1000 years ago in Iceland.\nMany millennia from the present, a broken down, old Thor with one eye and one arm sits on the throne of an empty Asgard. Thor curses the silence of the empty Asgard and resolves that if he is to die, he will die in battle. He calls for someone to bring him his arm, before remembering that there is no one to do so. Armed with Mjolnir and the Odinsword, Thor leaps into a horde of lizard-like creatures (like the one he faced on Indigarr) and vows the death of Gorr the God Butcher."

Agamotto explains that he knows the threat at hand: it's one of theCelestials, a race of almighty giants as old as time itself, but this one is more deranged and seems to be looking for something inside the Earth. Odin leads the group with the goal of killing the monster, forming a legacy that would get all the way to today'sAvengers.\nIn present day,Robbie Reyes, the current Ghost Rider, wakes up from a dream where he was living the previously described experience of his ancestor. He finds himself in his car, being questioned by a police officer. He impulsively decides to run away as he realizes he somehow went from Los Angeles to Cape Town, in South Africa. Suddenly, he's attacked by the currentStarbrandof Earth, its inherent defense mechanism, who intends to protect his planet by keeping something that lays nearby hidden.

Storage Facility with a group of U.S. Army soldiers. Apparently, they're being tasked with moving every one of the crates storaged in the high-security location after S.H.I.E.L.D.'s shut down.

Suddenly, the Starbrand lands between them in an explosion: he's terrorized by the fact that the \"fallen\" is drawing him there and he resolves once again to not let the Rider find the location. After the scare, the archeologists decide to keep digging.\nIn a Roxxie Burger restroom stall, Deadpool is asking forgiveness (in his own way) toGodfor his sins, when he's attacked by policemen who intend to arrest him for the murder of agentPhil Coulson.

On Earth,Captain Marvelleads theWar AvengerstoLondonto directly confrontMalekith the Accursed, who has stolen theEbony Bladefrom theBlack Knight.\nHaving become aware of the heroes' access to Bifrost, the invaders send troops to attackAsgard, Daredevil and Heimdall stand their ground with the help ofJane Fosterand theDestroyer. All over the world, heroes keep their efforts to defend the Earth:Tony Stark,ShuriandScrewbeardwork on weapons at theAvengers Mountain, which is about to become attacked by enemies;Roz SolomonlocatesRoxxon's base inAntarctica;Namorfights off Fire Sharks underwater; theDora MilajedefendWakandafromAngelsofHeven; inManhattan, theFantastic Fourare holding at bay Malekith's forces on their own.\nMalekith uses the Ebony Blade on War Avengers memberVenom, teleporting himself and it away from battle. The Dark Elves attacking Asgard manage to blow up the Bifrost, cutting off travel between the realms for the heroes. Freyja's team is cornered at the Black Biforst, and after sensing the Biforst's destruction, the All-Mother decides to instead make use of it. Captain America's team reaches Thor, but they find him consumed by warrior's madness.\nAtAvengers Mountain,All-Mother FreyjaandCaptain Americago over a plan to destroy theBlack Bifrostand retakeMidgardfromMalekith and his allies. Giving Captain AmericaJarnbjorn, Freyja tasks him with going toJotunheimand rescuingThor- a mission that Steve Rogers accepts.\nInAsgard,HeimdallandMatt Murdockstand inHiminbjörgat the foot of the shatteredBifrost. Heimdall tells Daredevil that he would often watch his exploits in the \"Kitchen of Hel\" - which Daredevil remarks is more than a little creepy, asking how they're going to go about fixing the Bifrost. Heimdall, whose eyes were stolen, tells Daredevil to take up his swordHofund, which will imbue him with its divine power and turn him into the next Guardian of the Bifrost, though he warns him that being imbued with the power of a god of omniscience may be more than Daredevil's mortal mind can handle. Remarking he never was a good Catholic, Daredevil draws Hofund and is transformed into a god, the Bifrost reforming. Heimdall asks Daredevil if he is alright, and the new God Without Fear replies that he can hear everything from stars going supernova to butterflies taking flight. Entering Himinbjörg accompanied by theDestroyer, All-MotherJane Fostertells Daredevil that Malekith will sense that the Bifrost is working again and that they need to act quickly to send the three strikeforces where they need to go and get ready to hold the Rainbow Bridge.\nCaptain America,Spider-Man,Wolverine,Luke Cage, andIron Fist- equipped with Asgardian weapons and armor, and astride winged horses - enter Jotunheim through a Bifrost portal. Spider-Man complains about only getting a shield before realizing he's insulting Captain America, who ignores him and asks if Wolverine can locate Thor's scent. Wolverine indicates a river of Frost Giant blood flowing below them, suggesting they follow it. Luke Cage wonders why they're using flying horses when snowmobiles would be more efficient, Iron Fist asking if he's never seen any \"sword and sandal\" movies. They're interrupted by an arrow the size of a telephone pole, which impales Luke Cage's winged horse. Spotting a pair of Frost Giant archers, Captain America tells his taskforce to take evasive action, Spider-Man offering to deflect the arrows with his shield. Wolverine sarcastically wonders how he was the one who died when Spider-Man is so stupid. As Captain America tells them to kill the Archers in the name of Thor, Luke Cage angrily removes the arrow from his horse and throws it like a javelin.\nFreyja,Punisher,Blade(impersonating Dark Elves),Hulk(impersonating a rock troll), andGhost Rider(impersonating a fire giant) try to sneak past a checkpoint inSvartalfheim. As Freyja tries to persuade the two guards to let them pass, they ask the Punisher what clan he belongs to. The Punisher - making a note in his mental War Journal to never leave the Five Boroughs again - angrily replies that his clan is dead, just like they're going to be. Blade berates Castle for breaking character as the strikeforce casts off their disguises, noting that if he squints hard enough the Dark Elves look enough like vampires for him to enjoy killing them. Freyja orders Ghost Rider to summon theHell Charger- the strikeforce climbing aboard and breaking through the checkpoint.\nInLondon, Malekith defeats theBlack Knightand takes theEbony Blade; marveling at the cursed sword's bloodlust and declaring it a fitting weapon for the ruler of New Svartalfheim - formerly known as Europe.Captain Marvelarrives with her strikeforce, theWar Avengers-Captain Britain,Deadpool,Lady Sif,Venom,Weapon H,Winter Soldier. As Captain Marvel engagesKurse, Malekith teleports out of the way and mocks them. Venom lunges at Malekith, declaring his intent to eat him.\nIn Himinbjörg, Daredevil informs Jane Foster that Midgard is slipping away. Jane Foster declares that she won't let that happen, asking Daredevil what the status of their away teams are. Daredevil remarks that all three teams are hopelessly outnumbered and fighting for their lives, adding that will soon be the case for them as well: Dark Elves are on the way. Immediately after he finishes speaking, a Black Bifrost portal opens and a group of Dark Elf suicide bombers charge through - armed with enough swamp bombs to blast Asgard to smithereens. Jane, the Destroyer, Heimdall, and Daredevil engage the elves to hold the bridge - the latter's omniscience letting him see the ongoing events of the war:ShuriandTony Starkworking withScrewbeardto build a new weapon to turn the tide of battle, even as hordes of Frost Giants, Fire Goblins, and Dark Elves approach the body of theProgenitor;Roz Solomonddogfighting a fleet ofRoxxonparamilitary helicopters while reporting toher bossthat the corporation has seized Antarctica; andKing Namorfighting a swarm ofMuspelheim Firesharksto defendAtlantis. Daredevil sees thatSindris razingAsia, theEnchantresshas conqueredSouth Americaand is raising an army ofthe dead,Ulikhas conqueredAustralia, andHeven's angels are fighting theDora Milajefor control ofAfrica; while inManhattantheFantastic Fourhave arrived to help take back the city.\nIn Jotunheim, Captain America cuts open a Frost Giant to save Spider-Man, who complains that they're somehow even colder on the inside. With the last of their winged horses having frozen to death, they're forced to continue the search on foot. Standing atop a dead Frost Giant, Wolverine remarks they're close, telling the others to listen. Iron Fist remarks that he can hear someone screaming, Wolverine saying that's Thor and Captain America telling the team to pick up the pace.\nIn Svartalfheim, Freyja's strikeforce arrives at the Black Bifrost and cut down the guards. As Blade wonders how they'll destroy it, the Punisher suggests rigging the Hell Charger into a car bomb, to Ghost Rider's displeasure. Saying they have all the destructive force they need, Freyja turns to Jennifer Walters, who starts charging gamma energy to destroy the Black Bifrost in one punch.\nIn London, Venom mocks Malekith and throws him through a bus. Malekith remarks that he wasn't aware they'd been fighting, having read the symbiote's mind and learned ofKnullandAll-Black. Wreathing the Ebony Blade in flames, Malekith impales Venom, seemingly incinerating him. Not noticing the Ebony Blade embedded in the street, Captain Marvel orders her team to regroup and find Malekith, then wonders where Venom went.\nIn Himinbjörg, Daredevil is overloaded by his All-Sight, enabling one of the Dark Elf suicide bombers to get by and blow up the Bifrost. In Svartalfheim, Freyja senses the Bifrost's destruction and tells the team their plans have shifted from destroying the Black Bifrost to holding it. As Dark Elf tanks made from giant crocodilian monsters approach, Jennifer decides to unleash her charged-up gamma energy on them.\nIn Jotunheim, Captain America's team comes across pair of piles of Frost Giant corpses so high they could be mistaken for mountains. Spider-Man spots Thor, but Wolverine pulls him back and warns the team that Thor is in the grip of something he's all-too familiar with: the berserker rage. Soaked with Frost Giant blood and wreathed in lightning, his hammer almost completely destroyed and his prosthetic arm missing, Thor lets out a scream of bloodlust and demands that every Frost Giant in the realm come to him.\nRECLAIM THE REALMS!"

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nYear 100\nThe group of NightcrawlerChimerasthat are freed from Sinister’s X-Gene influence are now a religious order that call themselves theNightkin. The Nightkin continue their gathering of powerful relics for theReliquary Perilous, often seizing these items as other worlds and civilizations fall to Sinister-infected mutants.\nVox Ignisreturns to theNarthex, now a spaceship that houses the Nightkin. It has been two years since Ignis has been able to convert new Nightkin members, and there are only 53 of them left. Ignis observes a ceremony occurring nearby and asksWagnerineabout it. A Nightkin member,Summernight, has begun to sense the influence of Sinister’s X-Gene breaking through. This was brought on by a traumatic event.\nSinister wove infertility into their genes, but the healing factor in Wagnerine eventually allowed her to give birth to a baby girl. Summernight was the father. However, once the child was born, she glowed and teleported away to an unknown location, lost to all. This was the trauma that triggered Summernight’s loss to Sinister’s influence. Wagnerine says thatMother Righteoushas made the lost child the core of their faith.\nSummernight, ready for his death, holds hands withAuntie Fortuneto maximize the probability of a successful teleportation. He dies as the teleportation barrier on the Moira lab kills him. Wagnerine notes that the newer Nightkin members don’t even know the significance of the lab, they only know it as being involved in their death rite.\nVox Ignis tells Wagnerine that he is not seeing Nightcrawler chimeras in the field, likely because Sinister is not producing more. Wagnerine is losing hope, as fewer new Nightkin appear and Mother Righteous’ list of items for the Reliquary Perilous continues to grow. Mother Righteous has told them that the Reliquary Perilous must be carried within the barrier to the lab to purge the world of Sinister’s gene strain.\nIgnis recounts Mother Righteous visitingLegionin the astral plane. She asks Legion what he would have done differently, and he speaks on a lesson learned about leadership. Legion is fed up with Mother Righteous and accuses her of being out for no one but herself. Legion takes what remains of those he’s saved and raptures himself to a “higher plane”.\nA page from Sinister’s progress log from 99 years, 11 months, and 22 days since activation of Moira savepoint #7 discusses the degradation and abandonment of the Earth over the last century. The Quiet Council’s vote to strike galactic empires first before they came for mutantdom eventually prompted expansion outward. By the time aBrood/Annihilusinvasion made it to Earth, it had already essentially been abandoned, with a small number being left behind.\nOn this abandoned Earth, the Nightkin arrive and findDoctor Nemesis. Most of his body has been taken over by his fungal brain augmentation. He begs the Nightkin to carefully extract the fungus before they free him, but they need to leave quickly and they cut him free. They teleport him back to the Narthex, as Wagnerine tells Mother Righteous that over time he may be able to help them to make new Nightkin members. Wagnerine says they were actually there for someone else, as the now-huge originalNightcrawlerbursts into the room and grabs Mother Righteous. She subdues him, and mocks him in front of the Nightkin, chiding them for worshiping him and demanding their faith in her. She then executes Nightcrawler. Wagnerine attacks Mother Righteous but she snaps her fingers and all the Nightkin drop to their knees in agony. She tells Vox Ignis to burn the apostate (Wagnerine) and as she leans toward him, one of her lanterns brushes against Wagnerine. During this moment of distraction, Wagnerine teleports away. Mother Righteous orders the others to get rid of Nightcrawler’s body and they wrap it in ceremonial linen and teleport it into the lab’s barrier.\nWagnerine senses doubt of Mother Righteous in the rest of the Nightkin, but she also had a vision when Mother Righteous’ lantern touched her - her child is still alive and is being held captive. She says there is a new Spark - a spark of love for her child and love for her people - a love that will “last a thousand years”.\n100 YEARS SINCE THE SINISTER ERA BEGAN..."

Hearing thunder, he turns wondering ifKing Thorhas returned for a rematch - boasting that he is invincible now that he has fed. TheGoddesses of Thunder-FriggwieldingStormbreaker,EllisivwieldingHridgandrandFimbuldraugr, andAtliwieldingJarnbjorn- attack him, the latter two ridingToothgnasherandToothgrinder. As Galactus incredulously stares at them, Ellisiv demands to know what he's done with their grandfather, the three goddesses attacking him. Irritated, Galactus states that if they seek Thor, they can join him in the depths of space.\nInthe present,S.H.I.E.L.D.AgentRosalind SolomoncirclesRoxxon'sfloating industrial complexabove the city ofBroxton,Oklahoma; lamenting that unless the corrupt mega-corp is stopped he whole world will end up a polluted wasteland.Agent Phil Coulsonlectures her not to involve Thor and reminds her to deny culpability inThor the Avenger's technically-illegal attack on Roxxon's property. Ros grumps that he sucks at pep talks, Coulson remarking that he's even worse at firing people before asking on behalf ofDirector Hillif she's made any progress. Ros remarks that things have only gotten worse, as massive sinkholes have opened up in the middle of the city, hindering her team's efforts to evacuate. Spotting Thor standing on the roof of a house, she hangs up on Coulson and demands to know what he's doing in Broxton. Thor states that he's deliberating simply blasting Roxxon Island out of the sky. Ros berates Thor for defying a court order, but he sternly retorts that the gods have never been bound by human laws. Ros states that he's playing into Roxxon's hands by violating their injunction, and that's only making things worse for Broxton. Thor refuses to back down when the citizens of Broxton have put their faith in him and Asgard; Ros telling Thor that the time will come when they need him, but asks for the time being to put his faith in her. Thor states that he has from the moment he met her, flying away as she grumbles that he could have kissed her.\nDescending into Sinkhole Seven, Ros' flying car is crushed by a falling boulder. Climbing out of the wreckage, she gripes that Coulson is going to kill her for totalling another car, a voice answering that that's unlikely unless he beats them to it. Seeing a group ofTrolls, Ros declares that she's placing them under arrest. Sneering at this, the leader of the Trolls -Ulik- tells his cohorts to eat her if they want, and save him a thigh. As the Trolls approach, Ros tells her belt to print a cartridge of maximum-caliber bullets, loading them into her pistol and opening fire.\nIn the distant future, the Goddesses of Thunder put up a decent fight against Galactus, wounding his left hand and knocking out several teeth. Angered, he blasts Atli with the Power Cosmic, and in retaliation Frigg throws Stormbreaker into his mouth before recalling it, ripping off his lower jaw. Wounded and enraged, Galactus states that gods more powerful than them have tried to kill him and that their bones litter the stars while he burns like a million suns - activating his planet-eating machinery and unleashing a massive blast of the Power Cosmic. In the depths of space, King Thor regains consciousness - sensing the Earth being consumed by the World Eater. Realizing he is not powerful enough to fight Galactus on his own, King Thor calls Mjolnir to him and flies in the opposite direction of Earth.\nIn the present, Roxxon CEODario Aggersteps out of a car at Bill's diner as the patrons debate whether to leave. As he's told by the waitress to get out, Agger smugly informs her that the building is slated for demolition - joking that he's building a Roxxie Burger in its place. As he mocks them and their misplaced faith in Thor, thunder rumbles overhead. Exiting the diner, Agger cheerfully greets Thor and asks why he didn't bring Daredevil to serve as his legal counsil. Thor quips that while Agger has his team of overpaid lawyers, he has his hammer - daring Agger to test him if he wants to see which hits harder. Agger remarks that Thor's hubris will only bring more suffering down on Broxton, Thor acquiescing that if begging were to end the peoples' suffering he would gladly do it and asks how much it would take for Aggar to feel like a man. Remarking that he doesn't know since it's been ages since he felt like a mere man, Agger pulls out his smartphone and speaks into it, telling the person on the other end that he's ready. The ground under their feet cracks, Agger telling his frightened lawyers that if they run their entire families will be homeless by the morning. Ulik and his Trolls emerge from the ground and devour the lawyers, Agger sarcastically feigning horror as he transforms into his Minotaur form and tells Thor to start begging.\nIn the distant future, King Thor arrives at theblack holewhere he disposed ofGorr the God Butcher's dark world, finding it has been consumed byAll-Black. Diving into the living abyss, Thor takes hold of the Necrosword's hilt and bonds to the primordial symbiote in order to save the Earth.\nTHE LAST DAYS OF MIDGARD - Part Four"

It's Loki and Lorelei, preparing to jump off the wings. This is part of Loki's plan to get past Heimdall without being seen, since Heimdall is the first obstacle to getting into Asgardia's dungeons. Fortunately, at the speed Loki and Lorelei are dropping at, the watchman of the gods has only an instant to notice them, and he's distracted by another matter; Thor fighting the forces of the Technocracy up in orbit.\nEarlier, Thor and his brother discuss Thor's playing the role of distraction. Thor has misgivings, not just about the plan, but trusting Lorelei. As opposed to Loki, since he believes Loki is not the one who wronged him. He asks his brother why, if he disagrees with the All-Mother, he does not simply confront them. Loki, refusing to believe they have good intent, simply calls in the favor owed by saving Thor from the case of possession some weeks earlier.\nNow, and Thor notes he remembers the favor, and shall discuss it the next time he and Loki meet. With Heimdall suitably distracted, Loki and Lorelei use a Charm of Liquid Solids to enter the dungeons of Asgardia. As they make their way through them, Lorelei notes the total absence of any guards, which Loki puts down to the Room Full of Incredibly Deadly Traps, the second obstacle on their way in. As Loki notes, what makes the traps so incredibly deadly is that some of them aren't there at all. Fortunately, he has help with that; a cell-phone with magically boosted connection, and Verity Willis, who can see through the illusions for them.\nThat done, Loki and Lorelei reach the third obstacle, an impregnable gate, which neither of them can open. Fortunately, at that point, Sigurd the Ever-Glorious opens the door for them.\nEarlier than earlier, in the dumpster Loki and Sigurd wound up in during their fight, Loki begins randomly kicking the sides, while explaining his plan; Sigurd gets captured in order to act as Loki's inside man in Asgardia, with the illusion of Loki's defeat helped by a handy bottle of ketchup to fool any observers.\nBack in the present, Lorelei starts to point out Loki said they were breaking into the most secure prison in Asgardia. Loki tells her Sigurd's was thesecondmost secure. Exasperated, Lorelei leaves, and Sigurd goes with her, leaving Loki to his own devices. Peering through one door, all Loki can find is an odd map, with a large 'x' on the top. He concludes that the cell he's looking for has no door. At which point, he comes face to face with Loki. The Old Loki.\nLoki tries to claim he was suspicious, but Old Loki shoots this down, claiming he was just looking for a means to wash his hands of his past crimes. Angered, Loki stabs Old Loki with Gram.\nIt has no effect on Old Loki, who points out that it shows the truths one hides, and this Loki hides nothing. He's well-aware he's the villain, and he enjoys it. He then tells Loki he is responsible for Gram's creation. And that's he's not the old Loki.\nHe is Loki's future, what Loki will become. At this point the All-Mother arrive, and demand Old Loki tell them the truth. He explains that in the future, Asgard will be ruled justly by a King Thor, with Loki as the ever-recurring villain, something the older Loki actually finds agreeable, though he quickly dodges the question of what happens to Midgard in that future.\nLoki, meanwhile, asks Frigga how she can allow this future to happen, to allow Asgard to be re-chained by destiny. Frigga's response is simple; knowing that there will be security, peace without the threat of Ragnarok, a better future, is a miracle, regardless of what happens. Angered, Loki quits his service. As he departs, Old Loki announces that he will make sure the future Asgard will come into being, for he is its agent.\nLater, when a despondent Loki returns to his apartment, the older Loki appears in his bathroom mirror to taunt him, stating that worse events are yet to come.\n• Nobody else would have done it - because nobody else would have the nerve! Loki’s crew comes together to crack the deepest dungeons of Asgardia itself!\n• It’s the ultimate caper - but is there one plot twist too many for even the God of Trickery to handle?"

She had no idea as to why but sensed it had something to do with Loki, she decided to check out this split and looked at the timeline.\nOn Asgard, Loki stood in front of Odin's bed as he lay down due to the Odin sleep, Loki had planned another of his mischievous tricks and just waited for his assistant, Kvisa to get there. Kvisa held a crystal that was important to Loki's plan but was hesitant on giving it to him for fear she could get in trouble, Loki proceeded to show her that nothing was going to happen to them by stomping on Odin's face repeatedly. When he saw that she was still nervous he began to hype himself up and had her join in as he continued to stomp on Odin's sleeping face. This convinced her to hand over the crystal, the two then left the room down the hall they overheard a conversation between Thor and Frigga in which Frigga feeling bad for Loki wanted Thor to take Loki with him on the next adventure. Thor was hesitant but decided it couldn't hurt and agreed to it, Loki and Kvisa passed by and activated their plan by pouring some poison into Thor's porridge and messing around a bit with the Destroyer armor.\nThor had his porridge and then him and the Warriors Three left to Jotunheim with the Destroyer Armor, Loki flashbacked to a time when Thor and his friends had pranked Loki with a supposed \"invisible octopus\". Loki considered this revenge for that and stated that when Thor came back home, he would be so embarrassed he wouldn't be able to show his face anymore.\nThor went down to Jotunheim and on the way he felt a bit drunk, he assumed he had possibly just had some bad mead and ignored it before crashing into Midgard causing a giant crater into the ground. Thor was confused as he was supposed to be going to Jotunheim rather than Midgard and wondered if Heimdall had perhaps made a mistake. Whichever the case, this caused all the humans around him to fear him upon seeing him and it didn't help that the Destroyer Armor bent a bus in half upon landing causing even more fear amongst the humans. Then earth's military arrived and threatened Thor and the others with their weapons, Thor attempted to make peace and tried to make it clear that the Asgardians came in peace. Sif then arrived and tried to help when for some reason the Destroyer armor activated, Thor and Sif tried to order the armor to stand down but it did not listen, the armor then proceeded to vaporize an armored truck full of humans. Thor and Sif proceeded to battle the armor and eventually Thor seemingly froze it in ice, unfortunately a human who had been deafened by the battle aimed his gun at the armor, Thor tried to signal that he shouldn't do what he was about to but the human did not listen and blasted the armor freeing it. Thor defended the human and fought the  armor but unfortunately the armor's beam was too strong and killed both of theme before shutting off, Odin then woke up in Asgard desperately wondering why he could no longer sense Thor.\nTony looked out over the city from his tower, he saw smoke and heard screaming but didn't know what to make of it, he was also on a business call with Warren Worthington. Tony attempted to convince Warren to buy stock from Tony but Warren having heard rumors about Tony was unsure of it, Tony told him they were just rumors, Warren informed him that there were also sources to which Tony pointed out there were no pictures. Warren was also unsure as he heard Tony had a secret project referred to as the \"I.M. Mark One\", Tony told him as he got into the elevator the armor was for protection and no one to worry about. Tony reminded Warren that his father Howard was also a Stark who Warren's family had trusted at which point Tony got a brief stomach ache causing Warren to tell him the answer was a no. Tony proceeded to arrive at the bottom floor and walked out while Pepper waited to talk to him, Tony's bodyguards followed him as he tried once more to continue to the conversation but Warren told him that \"No\" was his final answer and left. This left Tony disgruntled but he allowed Pepper to speak now, Pepper asked Tony if Happy had spoke to him, Tony realized Happy hadn't and listened to his voice mails as him and Pepper got into the car. As he listened in horror the voice mails he came to the realization that Happy was dead but refused to believe it until he saw for himself and brutally ordered the driver to go faster.\nLoki relaxed, drinking wine as he thought about his prank, he had redirected the Bifrost to send Thor to Midgard and with the crystal he had sent Kvisa had sabotaged the Destroyer armor. The armor would now attack Midgard and Thor and the others would be forced to destroy it with Thor being embarrassed and possibly being exiled, Loki unaware of what had actually happened found it hilarious. However, when the mood got dark Loki became afraid and wondering what was going on when he was grabbed Valkyrie and the Warriors Three who informed him that Thor had been killed by his prank. Loki didn't believe them and thought that this was Thor's way of getting back at him, however when he saw that all of Asgard was seemingly joining in on what he thought was a prank he began to believe it, especially when he saw Odin awake. Odin scolded Loki for what he did and asked if Loki had any co-conspirators, Loki's first thought was to rat out Kvisa but for some reason his mouth would not say her name. Loki was then given his punishment: banishment, Loki asked how long he was too be banished to which Odin basically told him forever and that his powers would be taken away before proceeding to do so. Frigga then stated that the worst part was that they still loved him despite all this, Loki then flash backed to the reveal of his parentage in which a snowball hit him in the face and afterward everyone began to watch him more closely as if he was a ticking time bomb. Loki before he was exiled proceeded to ask Frigga and Odin what he was supposed to do with this supposed \"love\" Odin then did as he said he would and banished Loki.\nTony soon arrived on the scene, he pushed FBI agents out of the way and they aimed their guns at him and he gave them full permission to shoot them in a passive aggressive manner. Pepper showed the agents that they had the legal right to be there, Tony looked over the scene as memories of him being sarcastic and mean to Happy came back, ones he now regretted. Eventually he found the place where Happy's body lay, Tony took off the sheet covering it and saw the corpse making him almost sick to his stomach, he then looked around the scene and saw the Destroyer Armor. He saw the evidence of how it killed Happy but thought that some certain things didn't add up, for example Happy seemed to be the pain target yet the mark of another man having been there was also present. He tried to walk to the armor only for part of his clothing to get caught by Mjolnir, he tried to grab Mjolnir in an attempt to destroy the armor for what it did to Happy but the hammer didn't budge. Suddenly lightning struck and took the hammer to Tony's shock, he asked Pepper about it before himself having a heart attack at which point Pepper called the EMTs. While in his limbo state of being both alive and dead Tony came to the following conclusions:\nWhen Tony awake he was in a hospital room and Pepper was talking to Doctor Donald Blake, Pepper noticed that Tony was awake and quickly went to his side. Pepper informed Tony that due to his heart attack he'd been out for nearly 24 hours, she also informed him that the government had recovered Happy's body and thanks to Rhodey they'd get to at least perform a ceremony. Tony attempted to get up but Pepper stopped him and they had a brief romantic moment with it clear there was romantic tension between the two but they were unsure of what it was, with Tony calmed he was now ready to get out of the hospital.\nRūna visited Thor in Valhalla to walk him down to the afterlife, Thor gifted her, her lost axe Jarnbjorn, the axe she lost when she went to Valhalla as punishment at one point in time. There Thor asked a favor of her, to prove Loki's innocence, she refused and told Thor that Loki was the one that killed him and that was the only truth. Thor told her he sensed this wasn't the case as he didn't feel Loki's treachery when murdered, Rūna promised him she'd investigate the death but to not be surprised when it revealed that Loki was guilty for Thor's death. Thor understood and walked off into Valhalla while Rūna began her journey in the library.\nThe Watcher who was spectating this branched reality noticed a leaf falling off the branches of Yggdrasill, it perplexed her, she suddenly saw in her palms a court jester falling off a ledge and a female warrior. She then noticed a comet zooming past her she followed it and despite being a being who is supposed to be neutral and not feel anything, she felt herself wanting to grab the comet.\nSix months later, Loki had begun working for a woman named Donna and would walk her dogs, Loki walked them to his other friend an elderly woman named Stella's house. Stella proceeded to give Loki a cup of coffee when suddenly a light from Asgard shown down to his mobile home, Loki in a panic lied and claimed that it must be aliens. Given Loki's neighbors were the superstitious type a rumor like aliens was enough to get them to panic and go into their homes, Loki quickly escorted the dogs back to Donna's house before walking to his own mobile home where he was met by Rūna. Trying to not cause a panic he acted like Rūna was his sister and walked her into his mobile home, Rūna belittled and mocked Loki for living such a low life much to his annoyance an anger. Loki would then flashback to how he'd gotten to live here, six months ago when Odin revoked his powers and banished him to earth he found a cave which he decided to turn into a tavern called \"Joker's\" due to Loki's own mischief. He then met Donna who taught him much of earth culture and besides Loki's gecko became his only friend, Loki becoming sick of Rūna's mocking demanded to know why she was here. Rūna explained that she'd been put in charge of proving Loki innocent by Thor, Loki believing himself to be guilty denied such claims of innocence and tried multiple times to prevent Rūna from finding a note that revealed his accomplice but she found it anyway.\nRūna demanded to know who Kvisa was but Loki refused to tell her, Rūna still not giving up on her mission told Loki the riddle Thor had informed her of. Loki took his tablet and solved the riddle finding that Doctor Jane Foster was the one Thor was referring to in the riddle, Loki then told Rūna he freed her of what Thor had told her, had solved her riddle, and now it was time for her to get out of his house.\nLoki and Valkyrie seek redemption in the first adventure of an epic new multiversal series that reimagines the origins of iconic Marvel heroes.\nSo many worlds, so little time. Infinite possibilities, creating infinite realities. Long have I watched the trickster god sow chaos. But . . . what if Loki saved Asgard from Tony Stark’s revenge?\nThor—Son of Odin, God of Thunder, wielder of the hammer Mjolnir—is dead. And Loki is responsible.\nIt was only meant to be a joke—tampering with the Destroyer, changing Thor’s course to Midgard—a bit of mischief with a chance of maiming. But Loki’s harmless prank spiraled out of control, unleashing death and destruction on New York City and the heroes sworn to protect it. The city was saved, but at the cost of Thor’s life.\nFurious and heartbroken, the All-Father banishes Loki to Earth for his crime. Loki finds himself in a realm of boxed wine, instant noodles, and some sort of regional performance troupe known as the “Buffalo Bills.” It’s a meager existence, far from Asgard’s grand courts, but he finds his new friend, Brian the Gecko, a much more engaging companion than the sycophants back home. A true meeting of the minds. Loki is the God of Mischief—but he knows, deep down, that he never truly deserved to stand next to their father’s golden child Thor, as two true sons of Odin.\nYet, he cannot even endure his exile in peaceful isolation. A Valkyrie—Hel-bent on carrying out her oath to Thor—barges into his trailer-home with his brother’s final words from the beyond: a plea to find a certain Dr. Jane Foster and pass on Mjolnir to its rightful heir."

She's in the middle of a firefight with security personnel on Roxxon Island. Solomon is supposed to be on paid vacation, but Coulson, seeing an alert notice that Roxxon is reporting a break-in at one of their facilities, quickly figures out what she's doing.  Solomon evades the security team and makes it back to her flying car, while reporting to Coulson on Roxxon's illegal underground toxic waste dump. Coulson informs her that Thor lost Mjolnir, but S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have all the details yet. Solomon takes her flying car to the Blue Area of the Moon and finds Mjolnir sitting on its surface. The phone call with Coulson breaks up, and Solomon looks up at the Earth. She reflects on Earth's beauty and how powerless it sometimes feels to fight for it when evil companies like Roxxon grow more powerful. She wishes aloud for something 'big' to tip the scales, and her gaze falls on Mjolnir.\nBack on Roxxon Island, Thor faces off with the Destroyer armor. They fall from Roxxon Island to the oil fields below, and the Destroyer, possessed by Cul Borson, seizes Mjolnir. Lying on the floor of Odin's throne room on Asgard, Cul tells Odin he has the hammer. Odin directs Cul to bring him the hammer, but to first teach Thor a lesson.\nSomewhere in the skies of Midgard, Odinson hears Freyja call for him telepathically. She uses the Bifrost to teleport to him and informs him that in order to right Odin's wrongs, they'll need an army to face the powerful foe he unleashed. Odinson pulls out his list of potential candidates for Thor's true identity, and suggests they use the Rainbow Bridge to summon them.\nOn Roxxon Island, Agger confirms there are no intruders left on the premises and orders his personnel to move the island out of the area. Malekith suggests they seal their deal the proper 'Dark Elf' way, through bloodshed, while Agger gets to see some of the realms he's purchasing. He teleports them both to Aflheim. Agger transforms into his minotaur form and they begin slaughtering Light Elves.\nMeanwhile, Thor continues to battle the Destroyer, who still holds her hammer.  Using all her might, Thor summons the hammer back to her, directing it to destroy all the oil drill systems and tanks in the process.  Silently vowing that the Destroyer will not be her death, Thor readies herself for another attack.  Cul reveals that he's the one controlling the Destroyer armor. Suddenly, Odinson and Freyja teleport onto the battlefield via the Bifrost. They both declare their support to the Thor, along with the small army they assembled: Angela, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Hildegard, Idunn, Karnilla, Kelda, Lady Sif, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Woman, and Valkyrie.\n• THE BATTLE FOR THE HAMMER RAGES ON!\n• BEHOLD, THE ALL-NEW THOR VS.

Meanwhile, on a rooftop,Falcontries to contact Jane on the phone, asking her if she wants to continue dating with him; at the same time,Doctor Stephen Strangecomes out of a dumpster with a huge octopus (a \"hexopus\") and he also screams to the skies that Jane needs to not only be a great Thor, but also a decent doctor and patient, finding time to heal herself.\nNow, Jane wakes up in a hospital bed, surrounded byOdinson, Roz, Strange and Falcon. Her friends try once again to explain to her why they won't let her leave this time, but she seems determined to help Asgardia anyway.\nJust as Jane is reassured that Asgardia will be fine without her help, the monstruousMangogattacks Asgardia.Heimdallstrikes it with his swordHofund, but Mangog shatters it and blinds him.Cul, brother ofOdinorders to send the beast away, but it prevents that from happening by destroying the sacred Rainbow BridgeBifrost.

They went expecting to never come back.\nToday, at a fortress floating in nothingness, a door to somewhere opens, from which emerges the New Avengers. This is less of a surprise than it should be to the force that runs the fortress, who begin chanting syllables. In groups of two or three, they destroy individual Nihilii. The heroes recognize the tactics as belonging to the Black Priests, one of the groups they were sent to fight.\nAs his alien allies fall, Odinson muses that these are days of Armageddon, when mad gambles must be made. Throwing aside Jarnbjorn and his cape, he reaches for the weapon on his back, Mjolnir... but the Mjolnir ofa different world, whose owner was a brutish monster. Grasping it, Odinson claims the power ofThorr.\nOdinson lays into the Black Priests with his preferred tactics, only to have his arm encased in a forcefield. Abyss, realising what their method means, shouts that each priest chants one syllable, and pool their efforts to change reality. They don't need to defeat every member of the opposition, just to focus fire to one member. Every Priest lost prevents their result from forming.\nThis plan works, until the Black Priests step aside for a respected member of their group, one they call the Eye. The New Avengers prepare to stop the Black Priests to combine chants again... only for the Eye to chant several syllables in succession, freezing the heroes in place. The Eye moves through their ranks, explaining that he has more experience than the other Priests. He stops in front of Odinson, removing his helmet... revealing himself as Dr Stephen Strange, of Earth-616.\nIn Latveria, back on Earth, Doctor Doom has locked himself in a small room with a deranged matter-warper, and started a speech about the inherently false nature of history. This seemingly-suicidal course has an end: during an Incursion, a rock from another world landed in his kingdom, and he wants his guest, the Molecule Man, to examine it. The Mad Thinker will be measuring all readings coming out of the room, in accordance with scientific practice.\nMolecule Man creates a copy of Doom's mask and accuses him of being a liar, but he examines the rock, muttering that was builtto make maps, then says that the problem began on Earth, but nothere. Doctor Doom asks why the rock is giving off a frequency that matches the Molecule Man's. Molecule Man looks at him cryptically, then says that they need to take a trip. With a snap of his fingers, he vanishes himself, the rock, and Doctor Doom away, leaving a cloud of smoke and a stunned Mad Thinker.\nAt the fortress, Dr Strange meets the New Avengers in a scrying room, and asks them how they found this place. Nightmask explains that his abilities let him travel the Superflow, the space under reality that links real universes. The Incursions and the destruction of universes is disrupting his abilities, but he can still travel to real places. They guessed that the groups they were seeking were headquartered on real matter in the no-space left by the destroyed universes, so they have searched, going from location to location, seeking answers and vengeance.\nDr Strange explains that the Black Priests have been drawn into a war between two forces, the Ivory Kings and the mysterious Rabum Alal, both of who seem bent on the end of existence. Ex Nihilo and Thor point out that both the Black Priests and the Illuminati have destroyed worlds, and Strange cannot claim superiority. Dr Strange explains that the role the Black Priests have chosen is as field surgeons. The group believes that by destroying Earths during Incursions, they can stop the process, stabilizing the heat death of reality. The Black Priests use words to change reality, and the world they use to destroy Earths during Incursions is \"life\".\nDr. Strange that his position with the Black Priests is due to his skill at sorcery. Where they learned syllables, he knows whole words. He asks their help with a great push they plan to make soon, to end the cycle of death by striking one side of the conflict. To find the Ivory Kings, they need to interrogate one of the Mapmakers. To find Rabum Alal, they need to interrogate one of the Black Swans. Starbrand speaks up, saying that each group should hit one of the targets.\nAs debate begins, Ex Nihilo, cuts it off, creating a small round cephinz, a crystal with a two-sided state. One side reflects all light, one side absorbs it. He throws it in the air, asking Strange to let the chaos of life be his guide and pick a side."

The public reacted in a surprisingly positive manner, prompting the city council to declare an Iron Man Day, which proved controversial. Iron Man is idling on a rooftop close to a venue organized on the side ofCentral Park, where he is schedule to give a speech in an hour, but he isn't enthusiastic about the celebration.\nHe dawdles around the park, mulling over what to say. He gets cold feet and decides to clear his mind walking on an empty subway. Finding a fainted man across the platform, Stark performs CPR on him while waiting for first responders. The man regains his pulse but passes out again, so Tony rushes him to a hospital himself. He stays at the waiting room for any updates, missing the event. After being informed that the man died, Iron Man loiters on the empty streets, dispirited by the turn of events. Returned fromSan Francisco,Hellcatapproaches Tony and comforts him, having heard the news. She takes him toAvengers Mansion, where Patsy has gathered some of Stark's allies to support him at the end of Iron Man Day, and Tony smiles.\nA social media feed shows the results for \"Iron Man Day.\" Most posts show excitement and support for the holiday, but a few scoff.Iron Manhimself is sitting pensatively atop a skyscraper, surrounded by pottering pigeons. In his inner monologue, he explains that this Iron Man Day wasn't his idea. To his surprise, people genuinely reacted with joy when Tony came out of his fake coma a few weeks ago, but the city council then decided to declare \"Iron Man Day,\" resulting in a discourse. Tony concedes that some of it is legitimate, due to his complicated legacy. He wonders what would happen if people learned of his stockpiled inventory of dangerous technology. Inside Tony's warehouse inLong Island,Jim RhodesandBethany Cabeare contemplating the massive haul, most of it stored in boxes in an endless row of pallet racks. Tony recalls that he bought outSource Control's entire inventory, breaking the weapons ring completely. He also mentions thatSpymasterandCarl Walkerare now stranded somewhere in theDark Dimension. Bethany asks Rhodey how long she's supposed to watch over this, estimating that it will take Tony years to reverse engineer and dismantle everything. Rhodey agrees with her, and sardonically wishes her a happy Iron Man Day. Bethany walks away, reciprocating with derision.\nRiri Williamsis shown at her lab, tinkering with theMandarin's rings. Tony narrates that he let one of the most dangerous weapons go, and that he is doing his best to trust Riri's plan to use them to save the world. He asserts that Riri is the kind of person who can actually pull it off, but he admits that he is beyond worried. He thinks about those rings every twelve minutes on average, and has hadB.O.S.S.keep a log of his anxiety. Meanwhile, inSan Francisco,Hellcatis standing atop theGolden Gate Bridge.Sleepwalkerhovers in the air in front of her. The ethereal being is informing her that a certain dream murderer has infiltrated the sub-thoughts of someAlcatrazprisoners. Patsy points out that those prisoners, which are on Sleepwalker's arrest warrant, are long dead; so they're nothing but ghosts now. Sleepwalker concurs, and elaborates that they are ghosts who kill. In his monologue, Tony explains that Hellcat is still in San Francisco, knee-deep on the supernatural. Stark assumes that she is having a good time; seeing old friends, making new ones, and fighting demons. He explains that they never consolidated plans to meet each other, and haven't even talked in a few weeks. Stark admits that he misses her and thinks about her a lot, but isn't having B.O.S.S. keep a log out of that data.\nDispelling his self-pity, Iron Man stands up and stretches. He looks down at a stage being set up in one of the entrances toCentral Park. A banner on top of it reads \"Thank you, Iron Man.\" Tony supposes that he is avoiding the obvious; that he has a speech to give in less than an hour, but it's the last thing he wants to do. A montage shows a traffic police officer blocking the road, the empty seats awaiting the event, and a hand holding balloons shaped like Iron Man helmets. Stark thinks to himself that he is honored, but that he could have done without the event since he knew it would piss people off, but he suspects more people would have been angry if he turned it down. Tony points out that some people are excited, others aren't, and most don't even care, which he thinks is a relief. Behind one side of the barricade, people cheer for Iron Man. Behind another, they protest him. Another shot shows different people in the park carrying on with their lives. Tony states that life goes on. In another part of the city, an activist is warning about the water crisis. A man close by is ignoring her, instead paying attention toSpider-Manas he swings by, having saved a small girl.\nIron Man flies into Central Park, pondering what to say. He stops atBelvedere Castle, where a group of drunk men wearing Iron Man shirts cheer him. In his monologue, Tony remarks that it's not even 11 AM, but reflects that he's been there. After landing, he waves at them coyly. He thanks them and tells them to be safe. Iron Man walks away, thinking about taking the long way to 79th Street, and that walking might help him formulate what to say better than flying. He considers improvising, but stops himself in his track after peeking through a bush into the stage, where a speaker is checking the microphone. Tony thinks that he can't do it, and takes off. He lands East of the event, where he is grateful that the blocks are completely deserted. Looking at the crowd for the venue in the distance, and contemples about coming clean about faking his coma. Tony walks down a subway entrance, thinking that he needs more space to clear his head. He notices there is also no train activity, and believes it's an exaggeration. Stark considers reciting his favorite poem on stage and leave, but quickly finds himself asking if he even has a favorite poem. He stops, telling himself that he is overthinking this, and that he overthinks everything. Tony turns around when he notices a middle-aged man wearing casual clothes collapsed against the wall on the other side of the tracks. He tries to call the man's attention as he flies toward him. Tony deduces the man might be in his late 40s or early 50s. He takes off the man's glasses and checks his pulse. He notices he has an irregular pulse and deduces he had a cardiac event. Stark orders B.O.S.S. to call 911, and leans closer, noticing the man's shallow breathing across his eyes. Using his armor's PA system, Tony asks for medical assistance, but doubts anybody will hear him with the event going up top. The emergency dispatcher answers B.O.S.S.' call. Iron Man identifies himself, provides a code word \"Jarvis\" and asks for permission to bypass. The dispatcher grants it, so Tony transmits his GPS coordinates to ask for EMTs, after which he explains the situation. The dispatcher tells him units are headed his way. Iron Man worries that they won't make it in time, and tells the unresponsive man that help is coming. Tony looks back at the stairs, realizing he would need to navigate them first before flying the man out of the subway, and that just moving him could kill him. He asks B.O.S.S. if it is already running a full diagnostic, and the A.I. diagnoses the man with a severe myocardial infarction. Before it can diagnose further at Tony's request, B.O.S.S. detects that the man's pulse is gone. Tony thinks himself that he is not a doctor, but he knows CPR.\nTony takes off his gauntlets to avoid crushing the man's chest, and places one by the man's neck for B.O.S.S. to keep track of the pulse. He orders the A.I. to dictate pulse every eight seconds. Tony thinks to himself when was the last time he renewed his certification. Stark pumps the man's chest, but he still has no pulse. Tony puts back on his left glove and asks B.O.S.S. to prepare the defibrillator. Tony places his hand on the man's chest. B.O.S.S discharges it, and the man spasms. Stark narrates that his suit has a basicAED, and that he is trying not to think about its limitations or what he could put into future iterations of the armor to make it more robust. The man is still without pulse, and Tony discharges the defibrillator again. The man raises his arm, and Tony holds it. Stark comforts him. The man struggles to look up, but holds Iron Man's hand firmly. Tony tells the man to stay with him. He faits and lets go of Stark's hand. The Avenger tries to call his attention to no avail, and tells him that he's here. Making up his mind, Tony cradles the man to fly him. He walks up the stairs and flies out of the subway, hoping that there is still time. Arriving at the emergency entrance of a hospital nearby, Tony recalls thatKorvaconce carried him right inside a hospital and saved his life. Iron Man storms into the facility asking for a doctor.\nSome time later, Tony is sitting pensatively at the hospital's waiting room, still fully clad in his armor. Meanwhile, it's already dusk outside, and one of the organizers of the Iron Man Day event apologizes for Tony's absence. Iron Man then speaks with a doctor, and is left clasping the back of his head dejectfully. He walks out of the hospital, thinking that he never even took off his helmet. Tony continues walking on the deserted streets, and takes off his helmet in distress. He sarcastically wishes himself a happy Iron Man Day. Stark notices a bar calledAinge Cornerout of the corner of his eye and walks past it. The bouncer sitting on a stool outside the bar tells him that they might give him a drink for free due to the special day. Tony hesitates, but a voice behind him rejects the offer on Tony's behalf. Stark turns around to see Hellcat, to his surprise. She explains that she heard where Tony was over the EMT scanners. She hugs Tony and comforts him. Patsy then takes Tony by the hand and asks him to come with her. Tony asks where, and Hellcat reveals that they're going to theAvengers Mansion, where she wants to show him something. In his inner monologue, Stark once again recalls that it's Iron Man Day, and that most people don't care. At the steps of the Avengers Mansion, he asks Patsy what is going on. She tells him to just come inside. Patsy closes the doors behind Tony, and explains that she and others figured that Tony might feel odd about today, so they wanted to be there for him at the end of it, as his friends. In his monologue, Tony clarifies that some people do care. A crowd consisting ofCaptain America, Rhodey, Spider-Man,Thor,Frog-Man,Gargoyle, Bethany Cabe, Ironheart andThe Thingwelcome him warmly. Steve wishes Tony a happy Iron Man Day. He smiles, repeating in his narration that some people do care.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nOutfitted withan arctic armorand accompanied by an A.I. companion namedB.R.I.A.N.,Iron Manhas ventured intoJotunheimin the search of somebody. He marches through the unforgiving cold of the realm for four days, and begins to show signs of delirium. He's stopped by a giant stone statue, who tries to stop his progress, but Tony shatters it with his unibeam.\nTony reaches his target's distress signal inside a tower, where he finds the unworthyThor Odinson, unharmed. Surprised by Tony's visit, Stark explains he has implants on most Avengers to monitor their status, and he decided to check up on Odinson after his prolonged absence fromMidgard. Tony suggest building Thor a replacement for his lostMjolnir, but Odinson expresses that it will never match the feeling of the weapon forged by his fatherOdin. Iron Man confides that, similarly, he hasn't moved on from thearc reactoras a power source due to the memory of his fatherHoward. He tries to convince Odinson that this feeling will linger even if he never reclaims his hammer, but Thor insists that he needs it. He commends Tony and prepares to depart. With his armor's thrusters damaged, Tony is left to choose between riding Odinson's goatToothgnasherwith him, or remain stranded in Jotunheim.\nDay one. A lump of ice sits on a desolate and snowy expanse. At night, two eight-legged zebras with ice for manes walk past it as the lump emits a red glow. Day two. A robotic voice announces that something is charging, and that a saline solution is being administered through somebody's intravenous therapy. Day three. The lump is cracked and a silhouette can be seen inside it. The voice announces the pilot is waking, and it welcomes Iron Man as the Avenger bursts out of the ice, clad in a black armor with red highlights. Tony takes flight, but before he can make sense of his surroundings, his jet boots shut off, so he maneuvers his landing. His onboard A.I. informs him that the thrusters are offline, and his suit integrity is at sixty percent. It also tells him that its comms are offline, but its quantum positioning system is online. As the surface of Tony's armor shifts to pure white, he asks the A.I. if a certain \"he\" is in his same location. The A.I. tells Tony that his person of interest can be located where they are, which isJotunheim.\nIron Man stands on a cliff, dwarfed by a massive glacier which overtakes the landscape. He looks down at his wrist, which is projecting a topographical map. A target in distress is marked across the glacier. The projection marks other data. The environment is -157 °F, and Tony has a little over four days left. Iron Man slowly marches through windstorm, putting a holographic shield forward and shapeshifting clamps around his feet. He asks his A.I.,B.R.I.A.N., if it's still there. The A.I. reminds him that it's not sure it can leave even if it wanted. Over the course of two more days, and as he continues walking, Iron Man tells B.R.I.A.N. about a time he saw theHulkseemingly leap into the air in a sonic boom without using his legs. The Hulk then turned around and smiled at Tony, and then the smell of the green giant's gamma fart hit him. Stark states that his lungs feel much worse than they did then. B.R.I.A.N. breaks out to Tony that this is the fifteenth time he has told it this story. It suggests that Tony might be delirious, and recommends finding shelter and food. Tony wonders if Jotunheim has crêpes, and before he can start reminiscing about his fatherHoward, a giant sword swings from above and breaks Tony's shield, surprising him. Stark clasps his shoulder, reeling from the attack, and grouses at the stone giant that has appeared in front of him. Tony's armor is already regenerating the shield. The creature warns him that no god shall pass beyond the frozenLake of Tears. Tony points out that he is not a god, but the giant repeats himself. Tony disregards the statue, but it swings the sword again, hitting Tony's shield as he lifts it above his head. Before B.R.I.A.N. can update the status of the suit's integrity, Tony impetuously asks it to scan the statue and tell him whether it is alive. The A.I. does so and determines it doesn't satisfy the predefined status \"alive.\" In response, Tony shatters it with an unibeam. The suit switches back to black as it announces its power is critically low. Using the shield to avoid the debris from the giant's destruction, Stark tells it that, as much as he would love the title, he is not a god; he is Iron Man.\nZero days left. Iron Man approaches a snow-covered tower as he drags something by a rope. He inhales and places his hand on his chest as B.R.I.A.N. tells him the suit is fully charged. The suit changes into white and B.R.I.A.N. tells him that they're ready for action. Tony buoys himself up to go save an Avenger. Inside the dimly-lit tower, its entry door is suddenly blasted away by the disembodied head of the fallen stone giant, and it curses out Tony. The statue changes its demeanor as it finds itself landed in front of the unworthyThor Odinson, who is resting by one of his goats,Toothgnasher, with several alien fruits by his side. Stepping inside, Tony brings attention to the statue's previous warning that \"no god shall pass.\" It makes an exception for Thor and gushes over him. Tony deduces that the statue might have been enchanted with a crush on him byLoki, and Thor confirms the hunch. Kicking aside the statue's head, Tony tells Thor that he received a distress signal from him, and asks what is up. Thor states that he didn't send any. Grabbing one of the fruits on his side, the God of Thunder question Tony when he turns around with his arm outstretched. Stark explains that this is usually the point where a villain springs their trap. Sitting on a pile of debris, Tony explains that he has implants in most Avengers, which send a distress signal if they notice an abnormality on any of different body statuses. He elaborates that Thor hasn't been toMidgardin a while and hasn't drunk mead in a month. Thor sinks his teeth on the fruit. Stark states that this situation is only possible if he were dead or in captivity. Thor clarifies that he goes by \"Odinson\" now, since another one bears the name Thor. He tosses another fruit at Tony, telling him that it doesn't freeze in the cold. Tony realizes that this situation is about Thor's loss ofMjolnir. He holds the fruit while cables that extend from his armor's fingers prod into it. Iron Man explains that he could make Odinson another hammer, joking about melting downWolverinefor hisAdamantium, and combiningWakandanVibraniumwith some ofReed Richards' inventions. He assures Odinson that he will have him soaring through the cosmos again, fighting evil with lightning.\nOdinson recalls his fatherOdin's battle against theGod Tempest, and that he trapped the sentient storm in a chunk ofUruthat he had made into Mjolnir, which would not allow any to wield it until it chose him. Odinson thanks Tony for his idea, but rejects it, stating that nothing he could fashion would ever feel the same. Tony sighs and confides that, over the years, he has discovered at least ten more efficient ways to power his armor; yet he always kept going back to different versions of thearc reactorbecause it doubles as a memento to his father. Stark assures Thor that, even if he doesn't ever get Mjolnir back, the feeling when he wielded it persists and can't be taken away from them. Grabbing his axe,Jarnbjorn, Odinson mounts Toothgnasher. He commends Tony, and tells him that his father would be proud of him, but expresses that he still needs his hammer. As Odinson takes off, Tony remarks under his breath that this is whyCaptain Americagives the speeches. B.R.I.A.N. informs Stark that the armor's thrusters are still damaged. He refuses to ride a goat with the bare-chested Thor, so the A.I. asks him if he'd rather choose death. Tony hesitates, and when the A.I. insists, Stark tells it that he is thinking.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nAfter barely defeatingUltimoin orbit,Iron Manhas been rescued byMadame Masque. She had kidnappedSenator Harrington Byrdon behalf of a mysterious master, but diverted her ship to save Tony. The aircraft has now crash-landed in theHimalayasinChina. Low on power, Iron Man scouts the terrain as he fails to make contact withStark Industries. Back at the company'sLong Island HQ,Eddie Marchadmits that he was hypnotized by a shadowy ring-bearing figure to shut down the plant's defenses so that Madame Masque could kidnap Byrd. From his laboratory, theMandarinobserves Iron Man and sends a lackey after him.\nTheRadioactive Manintercepts Iron Man and overpowers him due to the hero's weakened state. He throws him off a cliff and prepares to kill Byrd and Madame Masque. Iron Man reappears, having climbed up the mountainside and connected himself to Masque's ship to recharge. He encases the villain in lead-foil wrappings to negate his radiation, and pummels him with ease. After making contact with Stark Industries,S.H.I.E.L.D.has arranged to send a retrieval team. Stark also deduced the Mandarin's involvement out of Eddie's hazy description, so he gives Madame Masque an ultimatum: to either help him or fall with the Mandarin.\nA narration explains that, after barely defeatingUltimoin orbit,Iron Manhas been rescued byMadame Masque. She had kidnappedSenator Harrington Byrdfor her mysterious master, and her ship has now crash-landed inChina. Iron Man is leading the trio through the terrain of theHimalayas. Byrd is living that they are in China, since his presence as an American senator risks an international incident. Tony sarcastically apologizes for not dropping him off in his home state, and points out that they still have more immediate problems. Byrd keeps nagging at Tony, who remarks that Byrd would be in the hands of Masque's master if she hadn't diverted her flight to save Stark. Iron Man thinks to himself that he can't let them know his armor is low on power, and that he doesn't know if he can trust Madame Masque until she knows what is her endgame. The senator threatens to have Iron Man tried for treason, but Madame Masque interrupts him, approving the armored hero's initiative to scout the area. Byrd scoffs. Stark thinks to himself that things might be worse than they realize, since his suit-radio is still functional, but he can't make contact withStark Industries.\nThe narrator moves the scene to the company'sLong Island HQ.Pepper Pottsworries about Iron Man since the ultra-long-range frequency that is supposed to be permanently linked to him isn't working.Happy Hoganis controlling the radio, and explains that he is restarting the system. Next to them isEddie March. In a daze, he confesses to shutting down the plant's defenses and communications so Madame Masque could kidnap Byrd. Pepper confronts him, pondering why did March do this, since Tony is his friend, and trusted him enough to make Eddie a substitute Iron Man. Eddie confesses that he doesn't know, and that he only has a faint dream-like memory of a commanding, shadowy figure who was wearing sparkling rings.\nIn an undisclosed location, theMandarinobserves a command console in his laboratory. He is partially shrouded in shadows, and only his ring-bearing hands are fully visible. The villain boasts that Senator Byrd is close to international humiliation, and lists out that he will need to punish Madame Masque for her transgression and finish off Iron Man. He brushes them off, stating that he had agents tracking their sky-craft, allowing him to reactivate another underling. The villain presses a red button on the console to signal this agent of his.\nBack in the Himalayas, the trio is still close to the ship. Byrd complains about getting cold and hungry, and Madame Masque shuts him down. A voice nearby assures them that none of them will be leaving under their own power. Tony is surprised, and he notices someone coming through the trees in front of himself, someone who sounds huge and powerful. Announcing himself, theRadioactive Manemerges from the foliage with a pistol in hand. He brags that bringing in Senator Byrd, Madame Masque and Iron Man will put him in the government's good graces, and foresees a sensation of a trial to embarass the west. Iron Man braces for battle, warning his opponent that he will have to take Byrd over his dead body. The Radioactive Man concurs, and explains that the reason he allied himself with \"the Master\" was to prove once and for all that his radioactive powers are superior to western technology. He demonstrates by knocking back Iron Man with a punch. Tony thinks to himself that he is weaker than he thought after both defeating Ultimo and bringing Masque's damaged ship down; so he is helpless against the radioactive villain. The Radioactive Man grabs Tony above his head, and mocks him as he throws the armored hero down a cliff. Tony plummets, contemplating that he can't even activate his boot-jets.\nThe Radioactive Man turns to Madame Masque and Byrd, and tells her that her failure to bring the senator directly to the Master will cost her her life. Byrd barely reacts before Madame Masque shushes him and uses her gun to destroy the villain's pistol. The Radioactive Man tosses aside his damaged weapon, bragging that he is a weapon himself, since he can burn them to ashes with his radiation. Byrd cowers behind Madame Masque as the Radioactive Man charges toward her. Unfaltering, Madame Masque unloads her pistol on the Radioactive Man, albeit with no effect. A voice from behind contests Radioactive Man's claims, causing him to look behind. Byrd is startled as a device hits the Radioactive Man. Metallic wrappings spring out of it and constrict him. The villain turns around, and is shocked to see Iron Man standing below Madame Masque's ship, connected to it with cables. The armored hero reminisces that he used these lead-foil wrappings to shut down his radiation before. He also reveals that he had climbed up the mountainside and used the ship's batteries to recharge his armor. Energetically, Tony announces that it's time for round two.\nThe Radioactive Man lunges at Tony, boasting his atomic-fueled strength. Tony thinks to himself that, even though the Radioactive Man may be as strong asThor, he himself isn't powerless. Iron Man staggers the Radioactive Man with a punch and taunts him, deducing that he never learned how to fight since he always relied on his overwhelming power, and that power is not enough if one doesn't know how to use it. The Radioactive Man tries to grab Iron Man, but the hero ducks and uppercuts him, vaunting that he can use it. As the villain is sent flying back by the punch, Stark thinks to himself that it's better he doesn't use his repulsor rays since they might shred the lead foil. Tony pummels the Radioactive Man, as he thinks that the wrapping should hold enough, so all he needs is to not let up so the villain doesn't catch his breath. Madame Masque and Byrd observe the fight with determination. She tells Byrd to reconsider whether he wants Iron Man as an ally or enemy, and the senator gulps. Iron Man delivers a final punch, declaring that it's time for the villain's nap, and the Radioactive Man falls. After a minute, he has yet to move. Byrd approaches Iron Man trying to be courteous, but the hero shoots him down. He announces that he has managed to re-make contact with Stark Industries, and that they're havingS.H.I.E.L.D.send a team for pickup. He also reveals that Happy Hogan relayed Eddie's description about the Master's rings. Iron Man addresses Madame Masque, telling her to make a choice, since he is going to take the fight to the Mandarin, and she can either help, or fall with him.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nA montage showsTony Starkwalking on the streets on the crosshair of a scope, a narration states someone is trying to kill him.

Hefting his axe,Jarnbjorn, he vows to one day make the hammer his, and sets sail on a longship into the Baltic Sea alongside a crew of Norse warriors. As fog closes in, the Vikings grow uncertain, but Thor boasts of his superior senses - not noticinga shadowy figurewatching from the mists, standing on the surface of the water. One of the Vikings spots it and is terrified, but by the time Thor turns around the figure has vanished. Recalling the dead Native American god, Thor suppresses his concerns and tells the Vikings to shut up and keep rowing. However, Thor cautions the the captain, to row slower until the fog passes. Emerging from the mist, a pale-skinned figure - naked save for a cloak ofliving darknesssecretly follows, eager to hunt Thor and his kin.\nThree days later, on the banks of the Neva River, Thor and the Vikings face off against a group of Slavic warriors. The Viking chief is eager for battle and plundering, but Thor tells him to stand down as he wants to speak to their gods. Addressing the Slavic warriors, Thor challenges their gods to combat; the Slavs' chief boasting of the combat prowess of Perun the Storm Lord and Chernobog the Black. Another Slav calls out that their gods are coming as a winged horse swoops from the sky. The Slavs are confused by Perun's divine steed appearing without its rider, Thor giving the Vikings leave to attack while he investigates. Noticing the horse is spattered with blood, he mounts it and flies into the clouds - which are spattered with flecks of divine blood. A second winged horse flies towards him, the headless corpse of Chernobog still astride its back. Annoyed at his fun being ruined, Thor wonders whether the Slavic gods killed each other before dismissing the possibility, disquieted by the sensation that he's being hunted.\nWatching from the clouds, the black-cloaked god-slayer transforms his right arm into a blade of living darkness, decapitating Perun's horse in a single strike. As Thor falls, the god-slayer - his cloak transformed into wings - plunges after him, declaring that Thor now knows the fear of mortality and will soon learn what it feels like to be butchered. Turning in midair, Thor grabs onto Chernabog's flying horse - knocking the corpse off - and charges towards the god-slayer, who mocks his bloodlust. Thor introduces himself to his opponent, who declares his intent to slaughter the entire pantheon. The two clash - Jarnbjorn against the god-slayer's shapeshifting cloak and weapons.\nThor recalls an incident in his youth where he learned the difference between war and murder - an Asgardian named Dagr had embarked on a killing spree, and been imprisoned. Confused due to Odin having been praised for slaying thousands more, Thor confronted his father. Odin explaining that war was very different from what Dagr had done, as even the greatest warriors never relished killing or fully succumbed to bloodlust, as to do so would be to become a monster. Still confused, Thor had gone to see Dagr - expecting him to be feral and bestial - but had fallen into the mad god's prison. Dagr had not attacked Thor, but instead talked about his killing spree with such serenity and predatory darkness that Thor had been terrified for the five hours he'd remained in the pit. Dagr had been executed the following day, dismissed as a mad god, but Thor alone recognized that he was something far worse - seeing the same quality in his present opponent.\nWhile Thor manages to wound the god-slayer, he is overwhelmed by his opponent's shapeshifting weapon and knocked off the flying horse - which comes to his rescue just as he is about to be killed. Before the winged horse can catch him, the god-slayer grabs Thor and flies away with him, mocking his inherent divine arrogance with utter contempt. Thor dismisses his opponent as a butcher of gods, snapping that he's seen his enemy's like before. Kicking Thor in the face, the God-Butcher sneers that he hasn't. As he falls, Thor laments that his prayers to the elder gods to never encounter an individual like Dagr ever again have - like most prayers - gone unheard and unanswered. Impaling Thor, the God-Butcher asks what he's the god of, boasting that he's killed countless gods of all sorts. On the verge of passing out, Thor replies that he's the god of thunder, a massive bolt of lightning striking the God-Butcher.\nIn the present, Thor charges Mjolnir with divine lightning and then smashes thebeast of living darkness. Thor contemplates that the monster took hours to kill, and that the God-Butcher must have grown considerably in power since their last battle. Bidding farewell to the dead gods of Indigarr, Thor vows to avenge them no matter how long it takes and sets out to Omnipotence City."

Pelting them with a barrage of light arrows,Dani Moonstarthinks to herself that she can sense Seth's claustrophobia and arachnophobia - born from a traumatic night spent in the basement of his grandmother's house - but that was before Knull, and now his deepest fears are changing in real-time. As the symbiotes release him, Seth falls from the fire-escape, but Dani catches him - impaling one of the symbiotes with her spear. Seth profusely thanks her and she tells him to take shelter in the subway, turning back to fend off the symbiotes as he runs to safety. Thinking to herself that as amutantshe's been the source of peoples' fears, and with her powers has seen the fears and traumas that haunt peoples' subconsciousnesses, Dani notes that people who are scared of spiders are the lucky ones and that this city has run out of luck - aiming her bow at the sky as asymbiote dragonsoars overhead.\nManifesting her spear, Dani notes to herself that one of the reasons humans instinctually fear snakes is because it's impossible to predict their movements, and that it's the same with these symbiotes. Grabbing her spear, Dani stabs the symbiote again and notes that her attacks don't seem to actually be hurting them. Trying to see what the symbiotes fear, Dani reaches into their minds and is overwhelmed by the cacophony of thehive-mind. As the symbiotes turn and flee, Dani realizes that whatever they fear has arrived and looks up to see the symbiote dragon hovering overhead, staring down at her.\nInValhalla,Brunnhildeexplains a game that a group ofValkyrior-turned-Einherjarare playing to the apotheosizedJane Foster, who is disgusted to learn that the ball the women are tossing back and forth is actually a severed head. Turning to regard the Unnamed Valkyrie - who is gazing wistfully at theValkyrior-turned-Einherjar, Brunnhilde remarks that she wants to join them. Jane protests that she doesn't know how she'll save theSentrywithout her, but Brunnhilde reminds her that the Unnamed Valkyrie spent untold centuries imprisoned and only just got out to learn all her friends and loved ones are long-dead; advising Jane to let the Unnamed Valkyrie remember life before expecting her to fight for it. Jane laments that she has no clue what the headless Celestial that assimilated the Sentry and countless other lost souls is, let alone how to fight it.\nBrunnhilde explains that eons ago theCelestialsencroached into the Abyss left by the destruction of the Sixth Cosmos to began the creation of the Seventh, and therein encountered Knull - who decapitated one of their number with a blade of living darkness. Banished back into the Void, Knull used the Celestial's severed head as a forge to refine and temper his crude weapon intoAll-BlacktheNecrosword. While the Celestial's severed head eventually became the mining city ofKnowhere, its body drifted through time and space until it wound up in the Realm Between. There, the Celestial's fragmented soul attempted to fulfill its purpose by creating a world within itself, but the world it created was one of the dead. Jane asks if the headless Celestial is an afterlife, but the Unnamed Valkyrie scoffs that it's aBor-damned spiritually-bankrupt prison that doesn't belong to any pantheon. Elaborating, Brunnhilde explains that the Celestial's corpse is bound to All-Black, and through it to Knull; feasting on the souls of those slain by them in exchange for feeding them energy. Helping herself to a goblet of mead, the Unnamed Valkyrie scoffs at Knull calling himself a god, sneering that the only ones who worship him are the creatures he created. Jane remarks that Knull sounds like a god to her, being self-absorbed, single-minded, and utterly insufferable; causing the Unnamed Valkyrie to smirk and say that she likes Jane. Valkyrie says that two battles are being fought -- one in the mortal world and the other in the afterlife -- and that neither can be won so long as Knull is connected to the Headless Celestial, but the Unnamed Valkyrie retorts that the connection can't be severed. Brunnhilde insists that it can, and that she has a plan that first involves the Unnamed Valkyrie reclaiming her ax. Intrigued, the Unnamed Valkyrie asks where it is.\nLater, Brunnhilde asks the Unnamed Valkyrie to come back safely this time as they walk towards Jane andMr. Horse. The Unnamed Valkyrie is surprised when Brunnhilde says they never stopped searching for her, bitterly retorting that they thought she'd quit. Admitting that to be true, Brunnhilde admits that they'd seen how heartbroken she'd been afterAltadied and didn't blame her. The Unnamed Valkyrie bitterly states that she blames herself - having been in the process of bringing Alta's soul to Valhalla when they were engulfed by the Headless Celestial - and that Alta is still inside it. Brunnhilde is shocked, the Unnamed Valkyrie explaining that they were separated by the sea of lost souls and she was trapped with only the memories of her failures. As the Unnamed Valkyrie climbs onto Mr. Horse, Brunnhilde tries to console her -- saying she was the best of them and did everything she could. -- but the Unnamed Valkyrie retorts that she was the strongest but never the best; thanking Jane for her help. As Mr. Horse takes off, Jane asks Brunnhilde if this is a good idea, Brunnhilde assuming she's talking about the ax before Jane clarifies she meant teaming the Unnamed Valkyrie with Mr. Horse -- who calls out that he heard her as he flies away. Brunnhilde presents Jane with a flying horse named Brightwind, who she says will take her to Asgard to find what she needs in Midgard.\nOn Earth, Dani aims her bow at the symbiote dragon as it lands on a nearby building, sensing Knull is remote-piloting it. Speaking through the dragon, Knull says he can feel her trying to read his mind and asks what she wants to know. Dismayed at not finding any fears -- only his desire to annihilate all life -- Dani asks if she's indeed speaking to Knull, noting that in his eyes the absence of life and light is the most beautiful thing ever. Knull replies that he is everywhere, and when Dani demands to know why he's doing this he responds that he knows she's trying to distract him and buy time for the civilians to escape. As Knull gloats that it won't work, Dani taps into the minds of every nearby animal in an attempt to obfuscate the fleeing civilians' vital signs. Rebuking Knull, Dani says that he wants to destroy life but he underestimates it, forgetting that not all life is bright but that it exists in a spectrum. Declaring that Knull has forgotten about life's hunger and anger and will to survive, Dani peppers the symbiote dragon with arrows and sneers that turning off the sun won't work since life survives in the darkness too. Unamused, Knull simply lashes her with the symbiote dragon's tail - sending her flying.\nInAsgard, Jane lands Brightwind on theBifrostand greetsLady Sif- grimly observing that being all-seeing must be a curse when wars such as the one on Midgard are taking place. Without turning to look at Jane, Sif observes that she found what she was looking for in Asgard's armory and is now looking forHildegarde; observing that needing to ask Hildegarde to join a battle where the chance of survival is slim is weighing heavily on Jane. Agreeing, Jane asks where Hildegarde is only to be told that Hildegarde isn't in Asgard, sharing a chuckle with Sif as she realizes that Hildegarde is already having fun fighting on Midgard. As Jane leaves, Sif says she'll relay a message to Hildegarde that Jane is on her way - keeping secret her rekindled hope at seeing the Valkyries regrouping to ride again.\nInVanaheim, Mr. Horse points out theFort of Gaardar- home ofVanlandi, the self-proclaimed King of Thieves - to the Unnamed Valkyrie. Saying she wants to feel the ground beneath her feet, the Unnamed Valkyrie asks Mr. Horse if they can walk the rest of the way. Overcome with joy, the Unnamed Valkyrie drops to her knees and pressing her hands to the foliage, stating this is the first real living thing she's touched in centuries and that she knows it's real because not even the all-knowing undead Celestial could simulate the smell of life while torturing her.\nAt the Fort of Gaardar, Vanlandi meets with one of his advisors, having received a portent of the Unnamed Valkyrie's arrival in the intestines of a goat. Despite knowing what she's after and what she'll do to him if he refuses to give it to her, Vanlandi grouses that she came for his most-recent acquisition. When his advisor suggests just giving it to her to avoid any trouble, Vanlandi retorts that he's already lined up a buyer willing to pay premium for it and isn't going to just give it away -- especially not to some girl on account of a few bad dreams; ordering his advisor to marshal his troops and defend the castle at all costs.\nEn route to the castle, Mr. Horse recaps the events of Gandalf killing three trolls inThe Hobbitto the Unnamed Valkyrie and lies that they actually occurred and that he was present for them. Commenting that she's heard similar stories, the Unnamed Valkyrie is skeptical that it could have happened to so many people until Mr. Horse points out that for all they know all the stones in the Ten Realms are dead trolls. No sooner does she say this than a pair of rock trolls emerge from a nearby rock formation. The first troll asks if they're horses or girls, ignoring the Unnamed Valkyrie correcting him that she's a woman. The first troll comments that the hairy one is the horse, confusing the second troll - who points out that both of them are hairy. As the first troll concludes that they both must be horses and are to be eaten regardless, the Unnamed Valkyrie draws her sword and asks Mr. Horse what they call a dead rock troll. Mr. Horse asks what that is, and the Unnamed Valkyrie decapitates the first troll and replies that the answer is gravel. The second troll grouses that the joke isn't funny, the Unnamed Valkyrie quipping that it was a \"pebble\" of a joke as she decapitates him too. Mr. Horse calls out to get her attention and the Unnamed Valkyrie narrowly evades a throwing dagger aimed at her back - cutting off a curse as she sees a group of mercenaries blocking their path.\nOn Earth, Knull mockingly asks if Dani has run out of tricks and insults; Dani thinking to herself that fighting the symbiote dragon is like fighting an angry ocean -- her arrows fizzling out the moment they hit. Leaping at the symbiote dragon with her spear, Dani rebukes Knull for not realizing that he is very much like humanity, for what is more human than to destroy that which they do not understand. As Dani laments living in a universe where something as xenophobic as Knull is a god, she feels Knull's consciousness withdraw from the symbiote dragon, the dark god turning his attention elsewhere. In retaliation, the symbiote dragon strikes her with its wing and crushes her against the side of a building.\nIn Vanaheim, the Unnamed Valkyrie awkwardly asks a troll if the one she just killed was a relative. Despite knowing how the encounter will come to pass, Vanlandi -- standing atop a nearby ridge -- addresses the Unnamed Valkyrie and warns her to leave. Turning to look at him, the Unnamed Valkyrie says that he has something that belongs to her and that she's not going anywhere without it. Retorting that if it belonged to her it would be in her hands and not his, Vanlandi hefts the divine battleaxeJarnbjorn, which the Unnamed Valkyrie says was forged for her by thedwarvesofNidavellir. Vanlandi challenges her to come and take it, the Unnamed Valkyrie smirking as she says she thought he'd never ask.\nRegaining consciousness, Dani recognizes her old steed Brightwind and assumes she's dead and that Jane has come to take her to Valhalla. As Jane assures her she's still alive and reaches down to help her to her feet, Dani senses Jane's complex web of fears and notes that death isn't among them. Commenting that she's finally found them, Hildegarde leaps off a nearby building and slashes the symbiote dragon's face with her sword; nonchalantly asking Jane if she was looking for her. As the three warriors stand together, Dani senses that Jane's desires mirror her own: to fight against the impossible odds and win; Hildegarde happily inviting them to join her in slaying the symbiote dragon.\nSAVE THE SENTRY – SAVE THE VALKYRIES – SAVE THE EARTH!"

His attacker, introducing himself as Apocalypse, explained that he was acting to safeguard the future. When Thor attacked again, he discovered that Apocalypse was wearing armor capable of withstanding his godly might. He departed for Asgard.\nApocalypse returned to his current base, a Celestial-built floating pyramid, in which his old enemy Pharaoh Rama-Tut was resting. The Pharaoh had informed him that in the future a small number of people will disrupt his plans, and that they or their ancestors must be killed. Apocalypse demanded the next name. Irate, the pharaoh acquiesced: Folkbern Logan.\nIn Asgard, Thor arrived and demands an audience with his father. Odin explained that Apocalypse answered to the Celestials, and wore their armor. The Celestials wrung a non-agression treaty from the gods of Earth when last they came. When Thor demanded Odin help him anyway, Odin asks him to take the high road. As Thor left, he asked Loki for help, and Loki led him to a hidden scroll in Odin's library, which could bless a weapon to pierce Celestial armor - if the blessing is cast by Odin or his blood kin. Acknowledging his thanks, Thor departed... only for \"Loki\" to be revealed as Kang the Conqueror, Rama-Tut's future self.\nIn London, Folkbern Logan, the last pagan in London, was on guard duty against Norse raiders, when his guard position was attacked by the Horsemen of Apocalypse. As his friend died, Folkbern prayed for deliverence, and his prayer was answered by the arrival of Thor, who promptly slew the attackers. Apocalypse complains that Rama-Tut never warned him of this. Rama-Tut acknowledged the accusation and teleports away. Apocalypse vowed revenge, but he had other matters at hand: if his enemy's ancestor lived in London, he would burn down London to kill him.\nThor broke into the craft and accused Apocalypse of cowardice. Apocalypse managed to wound the god with his own axe, but Thor got the upper hand and cut the armor open. Stunned, Apocalypse said that Thor had cheated, but vowed to kill him with an explosion. Thor escapes, leaving a spectacle in the London sky, and confusion in the hear of Folkbern Logan.\nThat night, in Asgard, Thor boasted of his victory, only to be accused of childishness by Odin. The spell performed on the axe was no blessing, but a curse on Thor forevermore. In his search for petty revenge on Apocalypse, Thor had doomed worlds. Odin only hoped that Thor would one day learn from his mistakes.\nIn the present day, in the final resting place of Baron Mordo in Brazil, Kang appears to take the axe Jarnbjorn. It seems he has a plan.\nThe Apocalypse Twins Part 1\n• New regular artist Daniel Acuña joins just in time for Thor vs Apocalypse in the 11th Century! Wait until you see these two titans first meeting and first battle!\n• The Avengers’ ancestors are being hunted and only a young Thor can save his future companions!\n• And with Rama Tut and Kang pulling the strings, you know nothing good can come from any of it."

That same evening, Carnage swings through New York reflecting on how he was once a remorseless serial killer, but how the events of the Axis had left him with an uncontrollable desire to do good, which he hasn't the slightest idea of how to go about doing. Coming across a woman being accosted by a thug, Cletus fantasizes about bisecting her before scolding himself. Punching the thug hard enough to pop one of his eyes out, Carnage is attacked by a second thug and cuts off his arm. Paralyzed by his new conscience when he realizes he went too far, Carnage is attacked by the woman, who he realizes is a prostitute. He knocks the woman out with a light punch, congratulating himself for not killing her, but is yelled at by onlookers for hitting a woman.\nAt a massage parlour/brothel, Chris Rollins, a reporter, is approached by the Sin-Eater. When Rollins asks if he isa cop, the Sin-Eater remarks that the impostor is dead and takes aim. Rollins grabs the Sin-Eater's shotgun, knocking over a candle that sets the parlour on fire. In the struggle, he rips off the Sin-Eater's mask to reveal a glowing green skull, and the Sin Eater takes advantage of his shock to shoot him.\nAt the CVN news station, reporter Alice Gleason, Chris' coworker and lover, delivers a heartfelt eulogy. Carnage, observing the broadcast on TV, deduces that she is a good person and decides to ask her for advice on how to be a superhero, but once the cameras stop rolling she reveals herself to be a cold and ambitious woman who had been sleeping with Rollins to further her career. Her boss, Frank, issues her police protection, which she rejects and demands to take Rollins' place reporting on superheroes. Her boss initially refuses, but when she insists tells her to bring him something to prove her worth.\nAt Alice's apartment, she seduces the police officer sent to protect her. While she's making coffee, he spots someone hiding behind her curtain and opens fire. The intruder, revealed to be the Sin-Eater, is unaffected by the bullet and returns fire, killing the officer. He devours the green spectres that emerge from the officer's corpse just as Alice walks in. As he takes aim at her, rebuking her protests of being a good person, Carnage crashes through the window and shoots him in the head with his own shotgun. Alice faints and Carnage takes her, not noticing the Sin-Eater's head regenerating. Alice regains consciousness webbed to the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge, and when she sees Carnage inches from her face screams over his request for her tutelage.\nAXIS TIE-IN!\n• Carnage is back in NYC and the city will never look at him the same way again!"

Rune Thor and his partner, Destroyer Thor, are already planning to kill Loki and make it look like a suicide, thus closing the case. Suddenly, with a mighty crash, Destroyer Thor is knocked out of the building by the arrival of decorated officer Ultimate Thor and rogue irrelevance Thor the Unworthy. As they attempt to arrest Rune Thor, he unloads a brace of lightning into the duo.\nFive minutes earlier, racing for Doomgard, Ultimate Thor and Unworthy Thor had been discussing the case. Thor the Unworthy revealed that he knew that the killer had to be a Thor, because he knew how a Thor felt when they looked into the eyes of a Don Blake or a Jane Foster: afraid that their lives might be hollow or false. Ultimate Thor was suddenly struck that, if the feeling were true enough for Rune Thor to kill for it, then his late partner,Beta Ray Thor, died for a lie. Unworthy Thor says that makes it so important they bring Rune Thor in, and that they do it as Thors.\nIn the present, the noise draws the attention of more Thors, but they are fought off by Destroyer Thor. A shootout between Ultimate Thor and Rune Thor devolves into a fistfight which Unworthy Thor cannot join. Rune Thor starts ranting that he first killed a Jane Foster who was crossing a border illegally to aid a poor domain. He looked into here eyes and knew that the continued existence of Jane Foster would mean the destruction of all the Thors. So he set out to murder all the Janes. No-one could stop him, and now, no-one can catch him. Unworthy Thor cannot match him, the others are busy fighting Destroyer Thor, and Ultimate Thor will soon be dead, along with his partner, and all the bodies are destroyed.\nEnraged, Ultimate Thor barrels into Rune Thor, knocking his hammer from his grasp and pushing them both through a wall... and right into the Main Hall of the precinct house, where a woman with a hammer is giving a speech. She says that they were lied to, that Doom is not the All-Father, and that a final battle is coming and they will need to fight in it. Thors in the crowd deny her, but she shouts that they can trust the thunder in her words. In the silence, Ultimate Thor steps forward: he knows who and what he is, and he will follow this woman Thor into battle. As more Thors step forward, Rune Thor stands up. He says he denies them. Ultimate Thor says he cannot think to protect Doom anymore, but Rune Thor cuts him off: this is not about what he can do for Doom, but what Doom can do for him. With the power of Thor he can do what he wants and no-one can stop him... but Doom's eye is elsewhere, and the hammer sinks to the ground mid-sentence. Ultimate Thor knocks him out, saying he was never a very good Thor.\nMore dissent emerges among the Thors, but the new Thor calls for action, saying those who want to help her need to leave now. As a host of thundergods fly after her, one walks - Thor the Unworthy, carrying a massive gauntlet he has found. As he leaves, he passes the comatose form of Rune Thor, and his enchanted hammer. Thor the Unworthy pauses, briefly tempted to see if he can lift it, before deciding that it doesn't matter. He doesn'tneedthe hammer to be a good man.\nAs they fly, Ultimate Thor realises that he knows the new woman. She insists that she is not from around here, bu he cuts her off: she is Jane Foster. She compliments his detective skills, and he says he became one to seek justice, to speak for those who had no voice, like the Jane Fosters of this world. But now the Janes have a true voice, in her, and to his mind,thatis justice.\nThor asks Ultimate Thor for advice, as this is her first apocalypse. Ultimate Thor says that the best advice he can think is to approach the world with the power of the storm and a passion for life, even the bad parts. To outface everything it throws at you, to find the worst of its monsters, and to not stop hitting them until either they are dead or you are. His advice to her, in other words, is that she simplybeThor.\nAs the world falls into a montage of battle, Ultimate Thor admits that he feels truly worthy of the mantle that was bestowed on him. That even though he was just a catcher of criminals, he tried to be a righteous thunder god, and that when duty called, he threw his hammer as hard as he could, praying that it would land true...\nSome time later, in an Asgard bereft of its gods, a flash and a bang herald the arrival of a strange object: the hammer of the Ultimate Thor, bearing a challenge and a promise: that any may possess its power, if they only be worthy.\n• The shocking conclusion.\n• The murderer revealed."

Ultron appears, wearing a apron, commenting on how different his guests are. In addition to disclosing the Cosmic Cube-induced changes on Steve, Tony mentions that theScarlet Witchhas been possessed byChthon, thatVisionhas been infected by an A.I. virus, and thatOdinsonhas aligned himself with Hydra forhis hammer. Ultron clarifies his comment, revealing he was talking about Tony, wondering what happened the the charming charismatic figure back in the day, that has been replaced by a manic, nervous, overreaching mess of a man.\nHank interrupts his prisoners as soon as they begin to verbally clash with each other, and shows his disapproval for the current predicament of his peers, observing that they are in a constant state of internal conflict. He admits to building the Ultronic Territories because he saw the heroes were tearing each other apart, so seeing his enemies destroyed became only a matter of waiting. Pym reveals his dinner charade is meant to help the heroes reconnect with what they have lost, but he again berates them when the bickering resumes, demanding the heroes to acknowledge his importance. Tony lets out a laugh, and mocks Hank, ultimately accusing him and his attack onWaspas the starting point of the Avengers' fracture. Hank enlarges and attacks Tony, and defends himself with his positive contributions while rubbing Tony's failures in his face.\nUltron prepares to destroy Tony, but Ant-Man implores him not to. Lang soothes Hank, expressing his appreciation for Pym as the role model of a person that didn't let their failures stop him. Scott finally appeals to him by asking why would Wasp want him to do. After a moment of silence, Hank shrinks down and invites his hosts with dessert, giving Scott the Cosmic Cube fragment in his plate.\nLater, Ultron bids farewell to the members of the Underground as they leave. Hank apologizes to Tony for their altercation, and suggests that the ongoing conflict might be beneficial to them in the end and have a cleansing effect. As the Underground disappears into the distance, Captain America walks up to Ultron reminding him that they had a deal. Pym reveals that he gave the Underground the fragment in part because Hydra's consolidation is a recipe for peace, which wouldn't be in Ultron's interests if his wish is to see humanity destroy itself.\nSix hours later, the Underground members are still on their jet returning to their base. They soon see on the news thatNamorhas willingly given Hydra a Cosmic Cube shard in his possession, albeit solely to ensure the safety of his people. This news strike the heroes hard and brings down down their spirits.Mockingbirdencourages them, assures it's not the end of the mission, but rather an indication they have to work faster.\nFollowing Namor's visit,Baron Zemoensures Steve Rogers Hydra will not allow the Underground to abscond with what is rightfully his. Rogers tells him not to worry, because after all, Hydra has an inside man in the Underground."

Thor states that the best drinking place he'd been to was the mead hall of Ulfar the Bloodbeard, an Icelandic viking chieftain. In response to Thor reminiscing about sleeping with Ulfar's daughters, Logan grumps that he didn't need to know that much and jokes that he's going to lobotomize himself. Thor cheerfully raises a toast to all the drinking establishments on Midgard the two long-lived warriors have visited - especially those no longer in existence. Logan sarcastically raises a toast to being old, Thor stating that he is still in his prime, whereas Odin claims to haveto brought the gift of fermentation to mortals over a million years ago. Logan remarks thathewas the one to invent fermentation due totime travel, Thor cheerfully stating that Logan should meet Odin and that they would undoubtedly hate each other. When Thor suggests that Logan will someday earn his place in Valhalla alongside Odin, Logan remarks that latelyhe's felt like his time's been running shortand that he feels old as dirt. Thor's attempt to cheer Logan up is interrupted when a trio of armed robbers burst into the bar and hold the bartender at gunpoint. Logan extends his claws and Thor summonsMjolnir, the two of them attacking the robbers as Thor asks Logan if he couldn't enjoy drinking and fighting until the end of time. Logan retorts that he's not a god - just a mutant who doesn't die easily, and that while Thor may plan on making the most of being immortal,Old Man Logandoesn't.\nOnEarth-14412,King Thorfaces off againstLogan- who has become the avatar of thePhoenix Force. Thor incredulously states he thought the Phoenix Force had burnt out when Earth was destroyed byLoki, and Logan says that it did - but that it resurrected itself and brought him back from the dead to be its host. Thor asks where Logan has been in all this time, and Phoenix replies that he's been wandering the cosmos slicing up stars and incinerating black holes. Phoenix notes that most of the other cosmic entities have moved on or died - and thatGalactusfinally got his comeuppance by being eaten bya planet. Thor tells Phoenix that he's come to the edge of the universe to find a way to save it, proposing they team up to reignite the fires of creation - happily stating that he's already done so with New Midgard. Extending his claws, Phoenix angrily remarks that he'd heard about that before slashing Thor across the chest. As Thor incredulously asks if he's gone mad, Phoenix berates him for bringing the Earth back, saying he should have just let it die and that now he's got to destroy it all over again. Parrying Phoenix's claws with Mjolnir, Thor accuses Logan of being corrupted by the cosmic firebird's destructive aspect; Phoenix snarling that he never wanted to be a god but that he's still doing a better job at it than Thor. As Phoenix blasts him with cosmic flames and declares his intent to destroy the universe, Thor deflects the flames with Mjolnir. Wreathed in divine lightning and cosmic fire, Thor and Logan lunge at each other - the slowly dying universe indifferent to the two warring gods.\nElsewhere in the cosmos, the last pod ofAcantihave been slowly traversing the growing void, searching for a star to immolate themselves in. Ego the Necroworld emerges from the abyss and eats them, boasting that he has already devoured the Kree'ar Empire and the last of the Celestials. As Ego - drunk on the dark power of theAll-Black symbiote- bosts that nothing can stand against him, a voice calls out to him and states that it can do so. A tiny blue worm - Loki in disguise - challenges him to a battle to the death over the ownership of All-Black, offering him a chance to surrender peacefully. Laughing, Ego attempts to smite the worm with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but the worm is unharmed. Enraged, Ego vows to send the worm to what's left of Hell and lashes out with All-Black's eldritch powers, but the worm simply laughs as Ego starts to tear himself apart in his rage.\nChannelling the power of the God Tempest, Thor rips dead planets apart and turns them into lightning-infused asteroids. Lapsing into a berserk rage, Phoenix manifests a galaxy-sized firebird hot enough to melt stars; stabbing through Thor's prosthetic hand and trying to gouge out his remaining eye. Thor summons Mjolnir, punching a hole through Phoenix's chest; but as he delivers a eulogy for his former friend, Phoenix rises and attacks him. Disarmed, Thor is slammed into a chunk of planet, protesting that he still needs to save Midgard. Phoenix sneers that Thor is stupid to believe that he saved Earth: instead, he's doomed it to an even worse death. Ignoring Thor's protests, Phoenix stabs him in the chest with his claws, snarling that bringing back the most dangerous planet in existence has caught the attention of someone more dangerous than even himself, and that if Thor's grandaughters are lucky they'll already be dead - telling Thor he'll give them viking funerals when he returns Earth to ashes. As Phoenix bids Thor farewell and prepares to finish him off, a massive bolt of divine lightning strikes him.\nAt New Midgard, theGoddesses of Thunderwatch an approaching spaceship;Ellisivwondering if its occupants are friendly or not,Atlieager for a good fight, andFriggchastising both of them. As the spaceship fires down a beam, Ellisiv suggests contacting their grandfather before being told by Frigg that they were placed in charge and that Midgard is their responsibility.Gorgilla,Fin Fang Foom,Monstrom, andGoomappear, announcing the return of Earth's one true master and demanding they bow before him if they want a quick death. Atli eagerly sizes up Fin Fang Foom, Frigg rebuffing the monsters by stating that Earth is under the protection of the Gods of Asgard. Ellisiv takes out Goom with Hridgandr, while Frigg defeats Gorgilla and Monstrom with Stormbreaker; Atli mocking Foom while brandishing Jarnbjorn. Stating that he is not the master, Foom kneels and announces the arrival of their master:Doom- who wields theStar Brand,Iron Fist,Cloak of Levitation, andEye of Agamotto; and is bonded to aSpirit of Vengeance.\nGET READY FOR KING THOR AND THE PHOENIX, BUB!"

One of them awakens, asking if he's ready for another round of love-making, but Thor mutters that Gorr isn't dead. Confused and alarmed, the woman grabs her sword and wraps herself in a sheet, rebuking Thor when he tells her not to worry and demanding to know whose blood they're going to spill. GrabbingJarnbjorn, Thor checks outside and is relieved to see nothing is there, scolding himself for being so frightened even eight days after killing the God Butcher. Turning to the shieldmaiden, Thor states he doesn't want to dream any longer that night and asks her to keep him awake until the sun rises. Smiling flirtatiously, the shieldmaiden drops her sword and sheet and Thor embraces her - neither noticing acreature made of living darknesswatching from the rafters.\nInthe distant future, Thor the Avenger asksKing Thorif they're the same person. King Thor replies that he is Thor the Avenger's older, wiser, and more exquisitely-bearded future self; but refuses to say what became of his missing eye or why he has an arm of the Destroyer as a prosthetic, grumping that Thor the Avenger's acting like he's never time-travelled before. As King Thor leads his younger self through the barren ruins of Asgard, Thor the Avenger asks what happened. King Thor takes him toHlidskjalf, Thor the Avenger realizing that this means his older self is theAll-Father. King Thor asks if his younger self is anAvenger, aGuardian of the Galaxy, or if he's moved to the Sun and become acosmic god-copyet. Confused by that last point, Thor the Avenger asks King Thor if he remembers having this conversation already given they're the same person. King Thor retorts that he's so old he barely remembers how to dress himself, reminding his past self that there are all sorts of annoying rules governing time travel. Both Thors agree they hate time travel, Thor the Avenger asking King Thor what he's looking for. King Thor remarks that for the first time in 900 years the Black Berserkers besieging Asgard are gone and that maybe they have a chance against Gorr. Getting up, King Thor tells his younger self to prepare for war; chastizing Thor the Avenger's reckless eagerness to charge into battle. After King Thor teleports away, Thor the Avenger is horrified at his future self being the spitting image of Odin both in appearance and personality, praying that he's in a preventable alternate future timeline liketheonestheX-Menkeep going on about. Following King Thor's directions, Thor the Avenger enters a chamber in the east wing and comes across Asgard's mead chamber - deciding to help himself to alleviate the stress.\nIn the 9th century, Young Thor is tackled by a pair of Black Berserkers, slashing one with Jarnbjorn and shouting that he knew Gorr wasn't dead. As he demands to know where the one-armed God-Butcher is, one of the Black Berserkers uses a chunk of the Pool of Forevers' control crystals to open a portal through time and space beneath Young Thor. Surfacing in the Pool of Forevers and seeing Gorr standing over him, Young Thor prepares for battle but is promptly grabbed by a massive tendril of living darkness, slamming him around the chamber. Restraining Young Thor, Gorr declares his intent to pick up where they left off in the cave and resumes torturing him.\nBidding farewell to his fallen sons and vowing to savehis grandchildrenif they still live, King Thor makes his way to Asgard's armory and calls out to his younger self, delivering a rousing battle-speech. Thor the Avenger arrives carrying a barrel of ale, remarking that he's ready but that King Thor hasn't informed him what happened to Asgard. King Thor replies that Gorr arrived 900 years ago with a horde of Black Berserkers, killing or capturing all of the Asgardians until only he was left. King Thor states that Gorr then claimed a dead, blackened planet at the edge of space as his base of operations, enslaving countless gods and buildingsomething; but that all he could do was watch until his past self arrived. Stating that Thor the Avenger's arrival has rekindled his fighting spirit, King Thor thanks his beardless, dim-witted past self for making him feel like a god again. When King Thor states he can again feel theThor-Forcesurging through him again, Thor the Avenger asks if he's referring to the Odin-Force; his future self retorting that has had the Power of the All-Father for longer than Odin did, and renamed it ten thousand years ago. BoardingSkithblathnir- the most-vaunted Asgardian longship - the two Thors vow to stand together in battle against Gorr and his Black Berserkers, setting sail into the abyss of space.\nOn his blackened world, Gorr tosses Young Thor's limp body to his Black Berserkers, telling them to put him with the other slaves assigned to the building crew, and to make sure he drives in the last nail.\nIn theHalls of All-Knowing, theLord Librarianinterrogates and disparages a God of the Watch, who informs him that the Communications Division has failed to get in touch withChronux. The God of the Watch retorts that the Lord Librarian needs to upgrade his security enchantments, stating that the Department of Death and Taxes has reported that gods have been killed in the region of space where Chronux is believed to be found. The Lord Librarian asks if there has been any word from Thor, and is told there has been none.Shadrakstates that both Thor and Gorr have vanished into the timestream, the God of the Watch attempting to quickly wrap the meeting up so that he can attend the creation of his godson's first world. The Lord Librarian orders him to call the Parliament into session, threatening to destroy their family histories if they don't comply. Turning to Shadrak, the Lord Librarian tells the mad god to reveal everything he knows about Gorr the God Butcher. Shadrak states that it doesn't matter since every god that has ever existed will perish, the Lord Librarian demanding to know what he means and angrily throwing him into a bookshelf when he refuses to comply. As the Lord Librarian berates him, Shadrak explains that he helped Gorr in order to avert the brutal one-by-one massacre, granting the gods a swift and relatively painless death; revealing that he is the God of Bombs.\nOn Gorr's blackened world, Young Thor and the other slaves look in horror upon a moon-sized spherical bomb towering over the surrounding mountains.\nGODBOMB Part One of Five\n• Somewhere at the end of the time, all the gods of the universe are enslaved, working to build a machine that will forever change the face of creation."

During the fight, Loki distracted Thor, and tricked him into following him into a portal to the Moon. In the Avengers Mansion, Steve Rogers and Nomad were watching the fight when Jarvis entered, announcing that he knew a way to stop them. Meanwhile, in Latveria, the Scarlet Witch began destroying Doomstadt, as the defeated Quicksilver and Magneto tried to convince her not to do so. Doctor Doom returned with the resurrected Doctor Voodoo, who used the spirit of his brother Daniel to possess the Scarlet Witch and try to defeat her. In the Avengers Mansion, Nomad received a message from Steve, who had equipped himself with his old Exoskeleton and Energy Shield, that he was going to free the Red Skull. This piece of information was intercepted by Iron Man, who informed Captain America about it, and both set out to go to the Avengers Tower, where the Red Skull had been all along, he hadn't been freed, Jarvis had merely used one of Stark's cloaking devices to hide him from the Avengers.

When the pirates finally caught up to him in a labyrinth, his prayers are answered and he transformed into theMinotaurfor the first time. In the present day, he keeps the pirates' head alive for his own sadistic enjoyment. The two villain then get down to business, as Agger offers to trade Laufey's skull in return for mineral rights to Svartalfheim and all realms Malekith conquers in the future.\nOn Asgardia, Odinson consults Heimdall regarding the identity of the new female Thor. Heimdall says that as he respectfully reminded Odin himself, he is not nor has he ever been omniscient, and his sworn duty is to espy threats against Asgardia. Thus, the new Thor doesn't strike his eyes as a threat. That doesn't sit well with Odinson, who wants to know Thor's identity, suspecting that it's someone he knows. After reminding Odinson that he should focus on his own worthiness than Thor's, he starts describing the various threats taking shape across the realms.\nOdinson decides to go to Midgard to stop the trolls hiding there. As he fights his foes, he has a one-sided conversation, theorizing that Thor must be Valkyrie, Sif or Angela. He later returns to the Moon, reasoning that due to the lack of atmosphere, only an Asgardian could walk on the Moon. However, he reminds himself that Mjolnir landed in the Blue Area of the Moon, the only habitable area. He wishes aloud that Uatu the Watcher was still alive and curses Nick Fury for his \"damned whisper\". Suddenly, he is interrupted by Volstagg, urging him to return to Asgardia, because Jane Foster collapsed earlier in the day, due to her fight with breast cancer, and refuses any magical Asgardian treatments. After a talk with his ex-lover, Odinson crosses Foster off the list of potential suspects as Thor.\nHe then visits Agent Phil Coulson on the Helicarrier for the whereabouts of his next suspect: Agent Roz Solomon. Coulson says that Solomon was on leave after the incident with the trolls in Broxton. He then tries to call her at Odinson's insistence. It is revealed that Solomon's flying car is hovering above Roxxon Island, where Agger and Malekith are finalizing their deal. Suddenly, Roxxon security alerts them that they've detected an intruder on the roof. And that intruder is Thor.\nMeanwhile, Freyja confronts Odin for handing control of the Destroyer to his brother Cul. Odin retorts that Cul serves him and shows better fealty than his own wife, prompting her to slap him. Odin tells her she shouldn't have done that. He vows that the hammer will be returned to Asgard. Freyja warns him to be careful of what he wishes for, for the hammer will surprise him.\nBack on Earth, Thor calls out to Agger, accusing him of conspiring with Malekith, only to be interrupted by the explosive entrance of the Destroyer.\nWHO IS THOR?\n• That’s the question on everyone’s lips. Most especially Prince Odinson of Asgard. This issue, he starts to narrow down the list of suspects."

Bitterly noting that the gods never provided aid when they were needed most, Gorr travels back in time 14 billion years, tothe Void before the universe began. Coming across an infantelder godhaving fun sculpting grotesquely misshapen entities, Gorr looks on in disgust and growing rage before manifestinga suit of armour and swordofliving darkness- vowing to make his dream of a godless age a reality as he lunges.\nIn the present day, Gorr emerges from the Pool of Forevers carrying the baby elder god's heart, to the horror of the last surviving time god of Chronux. As Gorr remarks that all he needs now is a couple of moons, some centuries to himself, and lots and lots slaves; he is suddenly blasted by a bolt of lightning and smashed in the face by Mjolnir as Thor arrives.\nIn the 9th century, Gorr has finally succeeded in breaking Thor after seventeen days of torture. Genuinely impressed, Gorr asks Thor if any other Asgardians would have suffered as much for his sake, telling him that the pain will stop when he is told the way to Asgard. Gorr offers to start his genocide with Thor's enemies, asking if there'sa siblingora parentwho he hates; but before Thor can respond a group of Viking warriors storm the cave, catching Gorr off-guard.\nIn the present, Thor smashes a group ofBlack Berserkerswith Mjolnir, deriding them as empty husks and challenging Gorr to face him in single combat. Gorr sneers that Thor has grown since they last met, manifesting his dark armor; and states that his Black Berserkers are a part of him and have minds of their own - for instance, the ones who razed the Halls of All-Knowing having acted mostly autonomously, though Gorr speculates they may have been guided by his subconscious desire for Thor to witness his triumph.\nIn the past, Gorr rails against the berserkers attacking him, protesting that he's come to liberate them from the tyranny of the gods - which only further enrages the devout Norsemen. As one of them tries to free Thor, Gorr snares him with tendrils of darkness, but when he begins to launch into a misotheistic rant the Vikings tell him to shut up. Livid, Gorr decides that if they want to die for their god then he'll grant their wish.\nIn the present, Thor furiously asks Gorr if he remembers the faces of the Vikings he killed, Gorr stating that he does. Remarking that he'd never seen anyone so gleefully willing to sacrifice themselves before, Gorr states that Thor's Vikings taught him two important lessons: that mortals fear a world without gods more than death; and that he could no longer carry out his deicide alone. Overwhelming Thor, Gorr states that for two-thousand years he slaughtered every immortal being he came across, but that Thor brought him out of the darkness and and showed him a whole new way to carry out his mission.\nIn the past, Thor - enraged by the sight of Gorr killing his followers, frees himself from the chains of darkness and grabsJarnbjorn- catching Gorr off-guard and lopping off his right arm. In the present, Gorr remarks that Thor assumed he had killed him, but that instead he saved him - and to repay that debt Gorr says he is going to kill Thor last of all. Turning to the last time god, Gorr asks if he is done; and when the time god says he programmed the pool to Gorr's specifications the God Butcher kills him. Enraged, Thor swears that no more gods will die, but Gorr retorts thatallgods across all of time and space will die. Retrieving the infant elder god's heart, Gorr descends into the Pool of Forevers, telling Thor to stay alive as long as he can so that they can meet again. The Black Berserkers set about destroying the Pool of Forevers, but Thor breaks free and plunges into it - being transportedthousands of years into the future. Seeinga one-eyed old man with white hair, a beard, and a prosthetic armwielding Mjolnir, Thor assumes he is looking at his father. The old man irritibly snaps that he's not Odin, dismissing Thor as a beardless whelp but telling him to ready Mjolnir and show him that he's all he remembers the God of Thunder to be.\nIn the past, Thor summons a massive bolt of lightning that blasts Gorr and seemingly vaporizes him. The surviving Vikings cheer, but Thor angrily tells them to never speak of this day ever again.\nIn the future, Thor the Avenger and All-Father Thor push the Black Berserkers back, the latter noting that Gorr is recalling them. Thor asks where Gorr is, saying that he was right behind him; but the elderly Asgardian sneers that Thor is even stupider than he remembers - saying that Gorr has already been there for 900 years and has been very busy.\nThe living darkness comprising the Black Berserkers streaks through space and is reabsorbed into Gorr's armor, the God-Butcher noting the past Thor's arrival before remarking that there can never be too many Thors and stating that he arrived just in time. Looking overhis masterpieceand an army of enslaved gods toiling below, Gorr states that the day of his triumph is imminent.\nContinues inThor: God of Thunder#6...\n• The shocking finale of our opening salvo…!"

Fighting his way to the surface, he calls out forLoki, only forGorrto irritably stomp on his head in an attempt to push him back under. As thunder rumbles in the distance, Gorr sneers that King Thor doesn't have enough power left to oppose him and All-Black, but Thor retorts that the thunder isn't his. TheGoddesses of Thunderarrive and blast Gorr with divine lightning,Friggmockingly asking if Gorr remembers them.Atlisends her petstarshark,Death Mouth, to find Thor, telling Gorr they brought more than just a storm to oppose him. As Gorr snarls that that isn't possible, Frigg retorts that it is.\nEarlier, onIndigarr,Ellisivreads from theSaga of the God Butcherand notes that eons ago the planet was a desert wasteland whose tyrannical gods had been slain by Gorr; Frigg remarking that the entire planet now seems to be a withered garden. Ellisiv remarks that Indigarr's fortunes changed when a young girl prayed toThor, who was called to the world and brought rain. Hacking away at the overgrown brambles withJarnbjorn, Atli uncovers a statue in the girl's honor, Ellisiv saying that after Gorr was vanquished Thor returned to the past along withgodswho saved the planet. Frigg retorts that that story is ancient history, lamenting that they are all that's left of the gods and that they are wasting their time. As Frigg snaps that the Age of the Gods is over, Ellisiv retorts that Thor didn't let it end and kneels in the dirt. Frigg incredulously asks what she's doing, and Ellisiv retorts that she's praying. As Frigg snaps that gods don't pray, Atli angrily breaks up the argument by slamming Jarnbjorn into the ground and joins her sister in prayer. Frigg reluctantly joins them and the three sisters pray to Thor, themselves, and any deities that are left, conjuring a storm that restores the garden to life. A voice speaks Thor's name and a towering green-skinned god with thorny spines rises out of the ground, remarking that he remembers Thor from long ago. Ellisiv asks who the strange god is, and he replies that he is theRose Fatherof Indigarr.\nIn the present, the Rose Father introduces himself and the other replacementSky Lords of Indigarr- theMeat Mother,Our Lady of Comets, theChoir, and thePrince of Soot- to Gorr, declaring them Gorr's true legacy. Incredulous and livid, Gorr asks how they dare call themselves his legacy; the Prince of Soot blasting him with a torrent of ashes and retorting that after Gorr's deicidal crusade he and the others were left without worlds of their own until Thor brought them into the past and Indigarr; the Meat Mother smashing Gorr with a fleshy tendril and Our Lady of Comets shooting Gorr with a meteor arrow as they concur. Grabbing Gorr in a headlock with his thorny arms, the Rose Father saying that he and the others made Indigarr into a paradise all thanks to Thor, the Choir singing praises to Gorr the Redeemer, the Savior of Gods. Screaming in rage, Gorr frees himself using All-Black and furiously swears to finish what he started, but Frigg and Ellisiv blast him with lightning and say that he couldn't kill them even with theGodbomb. As Ellisiv snaps that Gorr's all out of bombs, Atli says that they have one - herself. As her sisters restrain Gorr with lightning, Atli decapitates him with Jarnbjorn, picking up his severed head and sneering that this time she'll make sure he stays dead by immolating his corpse in a star, then throw that star into another star.\nFrigg interrupts her tirade by saying they need to find Thor and that All-Black looks bigger than ever, Ellisiv interrupting by asking where the stars have gone. Gorr's severed head replies that he ate them, revealing that his resurrected body was a construct formed by All-Black, saying that he no longer has any need of flesh and that his new body has been busy feeding on the ruins ofthe universeand is now all around them. As Gorr declares the beginning of the Age of All-Black, Thor bursts from the primordial symbiote astride Death Mouth, brandishing theOdinswordandMjolnir. Thor tells his granddaughters to summon as much lightning and thunder as they can, and to find Loki before it's too late.Toothgnasherfishes Loki out of All-Black, the God of Lies joking that Thor smells more like a goat than usual. Frigg snaps that this means they don't have to save him themselves, Loki greeting his nieces and asking if they're not still mad about him siccing the \"Necro-Ravens\" on them. Frigg snaps at him to shut up and that the only reason he's still alive is that Thor wants him as such -  Atli quipping that there's hardly anything left for her to chop up. Ellisiv slams theSaga of the God Butcherdown on Loki's chest, telling him that the entire universe has been infected and that, one way or the other, this is the end. As she tells him they need to finish their own sagas, Loki opens the book and quips that he always preferred an ending with lots of tears and bloodshed.\nThor is shocked to see the Sky Lords of Indigarr are still alive, the Rose Father replying that Thor's not the only god to have survived the countless eons, the Prince of Soot adding that they've been sleeping and Meat Mother that they've been dreaming of revenge against Gorr. Thor thanks them for saving him, recalling the little girl who'd prayed for rain eons ago - telling them it's time for them to earn the right to call themselves gods or die trying.\nOnMidgard, a man shivers and wonders why it's so cold and dark. As he asks what happened to thesun, another man tells him to just keep praying to Thor and they'll be saved.\nAstride Death Mouth, Thor blasts All-Black with lightning; the ancient symbiote retaliating with maelstroms of living darkness,Berserker-Moonsthat attempt to devour the gods, and black-flamed meteors. As Thor despairs that he now has to destroy the very universe he fought to save, All-Black manifests Gorr's face on the surface of a blackened planet and welcomes him to the \"Necroverse.\"\nTHE RETURN OF THE GOD BUTCHER!"

Adam confronts the stranger, stating that this is their garden, given to them by their god; but Doom dismisses their god as an arrogant fool who will pay dearly for his impudence. Doom asks what right their god had to steal the sacred land of Latveria and turn it into a farm, Adam responding that Thor brought life back to the world and recreated the humans in his own image. When Adam asks if All-Father Thor created him as well, Doom furiously sets the garden on fire and snarls that he should have known who was responsible. As Doom monologues, Steve throws a rock at him, the two humans accusing him of beingthe Devilmentioned by ancient tales. Doom decides to kill them, mocking their attempts to attack him, but as he monologuesStormbreakerflies past the two humans and strikes him in the chest - heralding the arrival of theGoddesses of Thunder.Frigg,Atli, andEllisivapologize for being late and usher Steve and Adam to safety. Doom easily blocks their attacks and binds them with mystical chains - boasting that he has the power of theStarbrand,Iron Fist, theSpirit of Vengeance, andSorcerer Supremeon top of his own already immense power. Doom orders Foom to take the other monsters and carry out a genocide against the humans, tellingAtlithat if he wanted life on Earth again he would have created it himself. As he states that the universe is only meant for himself, Doom notices it's raining fire before being confronted by King Thor andPhoenix. Noting that thePhoenix Forceandpower of the All-Fatherare the onlyancient powershe has yet to claim for himself, Doom tells them to at least put up a decent fight.\nIn deep space,Ego the Necroworldpants in exhaustion, leaking lava andliving darkness. The mocking worm on his surface informs him that it's still there, Ego cursing it and noting that he's close to tearing himself to pieces. However, when the Necroworld boasts that the worm could never harm him in a million years, the worm takes up his challenge and begins whispering words of madness to him.\nOn New Midgard, Doom casually withstands a blow to the face from Mjolnir, laughing off Phoenix's attempt to eviscerate him. Logan laments that the Phoenix Force stopped him from delivering the finishing blow to Thor, demanding to know what kind of favor the cosmic firebird owes him. Charging Mjolnir with divine lightning, Thor replies that it's one worth killing for and tells Phoenix to give it all he's got. Doom laughs off their assault, but Phoenix reminds him that both he and Thor have been around much longer than Doom has, and that Doom's still new at godhood. As Phoenix monologues, Doom catches him off-guard and blasts him with a torrent of hellfire, reducing him to his adamantium skeleton. Thor furiously attacks Doom but is blasted by the power of the Starbrand, Doom subjecting him to the Spirit of Vengeance'sPenance Stare. Forced to endure the agony of every sin he ever committed across untold millennia, Thor is left utterly broken.\nAs Thor's screams of despair and anguish shake the world, the Goddesses of Thunder kill Foom and Doom's other monsters - saving the humans. Thor collapses, muttering that he's lived for too long and that gods were never meant to be truly immortal. Doom mockingly concurs and binds Thor in magic chains, but before he can finish him off Logan is resurrected by the Phoenix Force and attacks him. Thor tells Logan that he was right and that he should have left the Earth a barren wasteland, but Logan tells him it's too late to go back and that he has to keep fighting. Thor laments picking up Mjolnir in the first place, stating thatGorrhad been right all along. Logan tells Thor to get over himself and that even if he's not worthy everyone who would be is dead and gone. Blasting Doom away, Logan tries to rekindle Thor's fighting spirit before pausing to marvel at the beauty of the world Thor had helped recreate. Stating that maybe he was wrong about the Earth being better off dead, Logan tells Thor that they can't let Doom be the one to kill it. His determination restored, Thor vows to kill Doom even if it costs him his own life, but Logan states that Doom's amalgamated abilities make him impossible to defeat separately. As Logan grasps Mjolnir's handle, Thor incredulously asks what he is doing. Logan responds that the Phoenix Force only picked him as its host as a last resort and that they never got along, but that the All-Father had once been the lover of one of its avatars. Stating that the universe could use more love in it, Logan lifts Mjolnir and infuses the Phoenix Force into it, immolating even his indestructible skeleton. As Thor mourns his old friend, Doom sneers that Logan took the easy way out and that he will soon claim the Phoenix Force and Mjolnir for himself. Lifting Mjolnir, Thor bonds to the Phoenix Force and snarls that Doom's not god enough to handle it. As King Phoenix, the Thunderbird God of Fire, Thor slams into Doom and ploughs him through the Earth's crust and into its mantle.\nPhoenix-Thor and Doom's battle triggers cataclysmic earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that spew lightning. The mortals of New Midgard adjust to the new status quo and go on with their lives, erecting a grave for Logan marked with the emblem of the Phoenix Force. Finally, after ninety-nine years, a volcano spits out Doom's mask and the tremors cease. Thor emerges, naked, from a fissure near where three women andtheir red-haired daughterare wondering what's occurred. Announcing that it's over, Thor collapses and the three women celebrate his return, telling their daughter to get the elders. Eyes glowing with the Phoenix's fire, the girl states that Thor has fallen into theForever Sleepand that thetrue darknesshas awakened and is coming to kill them.\nIn the depths of space, Ego the Necroworld finally surrenders, begging the worm to stop. Sneering at how easy its victory was, the worm tells Ego that it will stop when he gives it what it wants. As the All-Black symbiote bonds to him,King Lokitransforms back into his true form - dubbing himself Loki the Necrogod, All-Butcher, and the End.\nALL-FATHER THOR FACES HIS DOOM!"

In theRealm Between,Jane FosterandDani Moonstarwatch, powerless to save her. InValhalla,Brunnhildedelivers a rousing speech pleading with her fellowValkyries-turned-Einherjarto aid their still-living sisters-in-arms. The ancient ValkyrieIvanirinterrupts, scornfully saying that the dead have no duty to the living and what Brunnhilde proposes is a fool's errand... but that she is old, foolish, and spoiling for a fight.\nIn the Realm Between, Jane's musings as she grips the thread of light are derailed as the Headless Celestial manifests a colossal sword out of its corrupted essence. Telling Dani not to let go of the thread, Jane transformsUndrjarninto a large shield and flies to confront the Headless Celestial - sensing theSentryamong the countless tortured souls it has captured. As she strains to hold the Headless Celestial's sword back, the Unnamed Valkyrie charges in onMr. Horseand smashes the sword withJarnbjorn, shouting insults at it. Jane marvels that the Unnamed Valkyrie chose to return, and she remarks that Mr. Horse can be very persuading - Mr. Horse taking offence to Jane teasingly calling him insistent, infuriating, unimpressive, and hard to understand. Saying that if they're going to Valhalla they may as well beat the rush, the Unnamed Valkyrie leads the charge against the Headless Celestial, Jane catching glimpses of the lives lived by the souls it had imprisoned. Caught off-guard, she is engulfed by it and dragged into its afterlife.\nJane finds herself as a child in a classroom she remembers from her youth, turning to seeMiss Anderson- a teacher who'd had a profound impact on her growing up. As Miss Anderson says they need to talk, Jane immediately realizes this isn't real - noting that he mother would never have let her wear that dress to school - and that she was fighting something, but can't quite remember what. Miss Anderson chastises Jane for fighting, but Jane recalls that the real Miss Anderson has been dead for years and that the woman before her is the Headless Celestial in disguise; reverting to her Valkyrie form. The Headless Celestial notes that the Unnamed Valkyrie must have told Jane things - annoyedly remarking that the Unnamed Valkyrie was stubborn and hard to please - before saying that it can give Jane whatever she wants. Jane finds herself in her house human form, wearing a labcoat, and the door opens to reveal her sonJimmy Kincaid. As Jane embraces her son, she thinks to herself that she can't take this and that Jimmy can't possibly be trapped here; the Headless Celestial saying that it's not evil. Determined to test if this is real or a memory, Jane recites the opening to \"Humpty Dumpty\" and is relieved with the vision of Jimmy finishes with \"wall\", telling the Headless Celestial that she's seen through its illusion again. As it asks how she could tell, Jane explains that Jimmy loved Humpty Dumpty but that as he got older he started changing \"wall\" out for other things like a rhinoceros or aTyrannosaurus rex. Unimpressed, the Headless Celestial says it could make Jimmy be whatever Jane wants, but Jane refutes it.\nIn the Realm-Between, the Unnamed Valkyrie dismounts from Mr. Horse - who prepares to go charging after Jane as Dani conjures a bow of light and says she'll cover him. The Unnamed Valkyrie orders Mr. Horse to stay put, and when he ignores her grouses that she can't be shown up by him before brandishing Jarnbjorn and charging in alongside him. Sensing Jane's presence, the Unnamed Valkyrie grumbles that she's going to die only to be stopped by the trumpeting of theGjallarhorn.\nIn the Headless Celestial's afterlife, it confusedly asks why Jane is dissatisfied. Stroking the vision of her son's head, Jane tells the Headless Celestial that she believes there are two afterlives - one being what happens to the deceased person's soul and the other being what is endured by the friends and loved ones left behind. Elucidating, Jane says that when someone dies the people who loved them miss them and cling to their memories of the deceased person, becoming different people as a result of having known them and finding meaning in their loved one's death even if there wasn't any. Jane states that she believes that is the truest afterlife, as it evolves and grows. Rejecting the Celestial's inner world, Jane says that it can't give her what she wants because what she wants isn't an echo dredged up from her memories, but the real Jimmy alive and well - something that no-one can give her.\nAs the Unnamed Valkyrie triumphantly proclaims the return of her sisters, Brunnhilde greets Dani Moonstar and then notes the connection between the Headless Celestial and Knull hasn't been severed yet - offering to help finish the ritual herself. The Unnamed Valkyrie informs Ivanir that Jane is trapped inside the Headless Celestial, the elderly Valkyrie retorting that the Unnamed Valkyrie had better hurry up and rescue her.\nInside the Headless Celestial's afterlife, Jane detects a note of urgency in its voice and realizes something must be happening outside. Discarding the form of Miss Anderson, the Headless Celestial offers her the knowledge and power to make the universe a better place. Turning Jane into her Thor form, it offers to make her a god again if she agrees to give it the one thing it lacks - life; summoning the soul of the Sentry, who begs Jane to accept and says that the Headless Celestial's hive could help vanquish Knull. Jane briefly considers its offer before saying that while she would gladly give her life to save Midgard, the Headless Celestial needs to stop and release the souls it has consumed.\nIn the Realm Between, Brunnhilde, Ivanir, and Dani complete the ritual and sever the Headless Celestial's connection to the Necrosword. Knull - who had been completely oblivious that the connection existed - senses the loss of the majority of his power and swears revenge on the Valkyries for inflicting it. Hildegard's symbiote-prison shatters and she watches as the divine needle returns to the Realm Between and stabs into the Headless Celestial's chest, the Unnamed Valkyrie vengefully driving Jarnbjorn into its armor and opening a hole into the Headless Celestial's afterlife. Reverting to its true form - a severed head floating over an armored body - the Headless Celestial's soul petulantly demands to know why it should relinquish the souls it has absorbed, Jane stating that doing so will determine where in the afterlife it will end up next. When the Celestial accuses her of being a hypocrite due to not letting go of her son, Jane says that she has in her own way, reciting the end of \"Humpty Dumpty\" as she lets the illusion of Jimmy fade. Surrounded by the spirits of those it absorbed, the Headless Celestial's soul collapses to its knees, Jane kneeling before it and gently saying that it's now it's turn. Dani marvels as the Headless Celestial's body crumbles and dissipates, while inside what's left of its afterlife the Unnamed Valkyrie is reunited withAlta- the two reminiscing about their long-lost romance. The Sentry approaches Jane and she asks if what she'd seen had really been him, asking if he'd meant what he'd said. The Sentry replies that it had been the part of him that had been angry and frustrated at having died, but that he's now whole and ready to pass on to the afterlife.\nAs Ivanir escorts the Headless Celestial's soul away, Jane asks where they're going and Brunnhilde replies that she's taking it to whatever afterlife awaits deceased Celestials; while they will take their own to Valhalla. Approaching Jane, the Unnamed Valkyrie asks who the child with her was, and Jane replies that it was her son Jimmy - who had died when he was eight. The Unnamed Valkyrie asks if Jane had found meaning in his death, noting that she's searched for meaning in Alta's but found none, and Jane says she hasn't yet but owes it to her son not to give up until she does. Jane offers the Unnamed Valkyrie the piece of advice to carry on living and focus on the good Alta left in her; the Unnamed Valkyrie remarking that Alta taught her how to throw an ax - among other more pleasurable things. Dani interjects to say they will need the Unnamed Valkyrie's ax skills along with all of their other talents if they are to overthrow Knull. As they set out to return to Midgard, the Unnamed Valkyrie asks if they can beat Knull, Dani responding that she doesn't know that the can't. Jane remarks that Dani's hope they can is enough for her, the Unnamed Valkyrie grumbling that fighting for hope is worth a shot.\nTHE LAST RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES!"

All of them tell the same story: Kang has acquired cosmic power, making him the most feared person on the planet. Whatever reason for their initial service to him, they nowhaveto continue serving, or Kang will destroy them.\nIn low Earth orbit, Kang still drinks of the energy around the corpse of Exitar the Executioner. The fearsome energies of the dead god are enough to burn Deathlok Abomination, causing him to lose his grip on Thor. Kang acknowledges that by his own code he owes Thor a physical combat, but that it will come at a time of Kang's choosing. He backhands the god of thunder towards the Earth.\nThor is not alone. Sunfire flies towards Kang carrying Havok. In flight, Sunfire says he warned of Kang's betrayal when he approached them on Planet X, and Havok acknowedges this. Now their only hope of saving the world is to use their mutant powers to absorb Exitar's powers first. Striking from behind, they are ambushed by Kang, time-hopping. Kang stabs Sunfire in the heart with his newfound cosmic power, slowing down time so as to prolong the agony. As Havok charges up on the energy, preparing to exact vengeance, Kang sneers: if Havok will not serve, he will never see his daughter again.\nOn Earth, the Chronos Corps is about to defeat the Avengers, but they are caught off guard by the arrival of Immortus, Kang's possible future self, and his own cross-time allies, the Infinity Watch. Tipping the balance in Manhattan, they give time for the real fight to continue...\nAt the corpse of Exitar, Kang starts monologuing, claiming that he arranged Havok's marriage to Wasp to arrange for just this moment. Havok's mind reels from this, holding to the notion that Kang has no reason to lie... until the facade drops. Kang, despite his veneer of omnipotence, is a sociopathic man with an agenda. He has no reason to tell his opponent the truth. Havok runs up to strike Kang - he will rescue his daughter by force.\nDespite Havok's cosmic power, Kang is stronger... but a sudden arrival tips the scales. Sunfire, reanimated as an energy being by the power of Exitar's corpse, makes swift work of Kang before firing a massive energy burst at the Apocalypse Twin's Ark.\nIn the Ark, Eimin uses her temporal synaesthesia to see the whole truth at last: Kang was manipulating them their whole lives, and by rebelling, they gave him exactly what he wanted. Acknowledging that they will get no vengeance, they take solace knowing that they will die together.\nAt the corpse, Havok gives Kang a taste of his own medicine by ambushing and immediately overmatching him. Complaining that Havok will suffer for this, Kang teleports away, taking all his soldiers with him...\n...all but one. Ahab has remained in the past. His mission awaits him.\nThe Sentry takes custody of the corpse of Exitar the Executioner. He tells Wasp that Exitar will one day return from the White Hot Room. He takes the corpse away from Earth, but warns that the Celestials' wrath will be great.\nIn Manhattan, people search for their loved ones. Rogue, no longer able to sanely contain the minds of almost every superhuman on Earth, starts to scream. Scarlet Witch steps in, using her remaining magic to disperse the power to its original owners. Rogue still complains, and the Avengers face a new wrinkle - Rogue has Wonder Man's powers and mind within her now.\nHavok is brought down by Sunfire. Scientific curiosity at Sunfire's new powers is tabled by common courtesy, as Havok and Wasp mourn for their daughter.\nIn an epilogue in the Sahara Desert, the remaining Horsemen of Death, Grim Reaper and Daken, emerge from the wreckage of the Mutant Ark holding the corpses of the Twins. They complain to each other that they had been promised victory and revenge - horrifically-disproportionate revenge - but that they are still alive, and that they can work with that.\n• This is it! The final chapter of the story that began in Dimension Z!\n• Complete unity is established, but is it too late?\n• The fate of the seven prime timelines decided!"

The Red Skull interrupts this man's babble and unties him, subsequently dragging him away in the midst of the his cries for help. As they leave, the Red Skull assures Steve his turn is coming soon enough.\nInManhattan, within theDarkforcedome,Claire TempleandCloakget an extremely weakenedDaggerto light up and provide light to the city whileDoctor Strangeapproaches a monstrous-looking librarian inside an atheneum of magic, looking for a spell to cast out the darkness. At the same time in the streets of the city,Daredeviltakes down a group of smugglers. Their boss,Wilson Fiskappears on the scene and taunts Daredevil, revealing the destination of canned goods his men were transporting is theMercy General Hospital. Daredevil questions Fisk's intentions, as he has been playing the role of good Samaritan while seemingly asking for nothing in return. The former Kingpin partially disproves his claims, telling Daredevil that in return he's asking the citizens to remember he protected them in their darkest hours, which he expects will cement his status as a community leader once the crisis is over.\nBack in the forest, Steve inquires the Red Skull while the villain is eating by a campfire. The Red Skull reveals he knows everything about Rogers, while Steve isn't sure if he remembers the Red Skull. In light of this, the Red Skull decides to formally introduce himself as the man who put Steve in the place where he is. When Steve questions where is \"here,\" the Skull replies they are inHell. He expands on that revelation, mentioning that he and Steve are nothing but ghosts, fading remnants in torment. When Steve recalls the Red Skull offered him the chance to free him from this place, the villain acknowledges he did while heating up the tip of his barbed bat in the fire, and proceeds to press it against Steve's chest, telling him that the only path to peace is death.\nAt theRed Room's safe house inMaryland,Nadia Pymprepares to leave, expressing her indignation that theChampions' attempts to talkBlack Widowout of killingCaptain Americaended with the team bending to her will. She argues that has seen firsthand what the Red Room does to people and doesn't want her friends to have to be subjected to it.Spider-Manconvinces her to let him talk to Black Widow one last time, and subsequently approaches Natasha while she's sitting on the house's porch. Miles tells her about Nadia's dissension, and questions if Natasha's methods are necessary. Natasha counters that they have worked so far, pointing the last mission's success as an example. She explains that the Red Room is meant to be a gift for the younger heroes, a way to survive through the new world the old generation has left them, a world that will only get worse with time. Spider-Man brings up that her worldview is only one possibility, with another being that the Underground will manage to fix what's wrong with Captain America. He then asks Black Widow to hold out hope, believing that Natasha secretly wants to share his optimism.\nDuring the siege atThe Mount, Captain America speaks to the recently-resurrectedBruce Banneraboard a Hydra Helicarrier to convince him to join his cause for the little time he has left. Inside the Underground's base,Iron Manobserves in the control room with other heroes as their defenses are holding up against the attackers. Iron Man turns his attention to the people within the room, divulging that he's aware somebody must've tipped off Hydra.MockingbirdaccusesQuicksilverof working with Hydra to ensure theScarlet Witch's safety. In return, Pietro reveals he saw Bobbi sneaking off to make secret calls, forcing her to reveal she's been contactingMaria Hillto get her to hold off her operations to give Tony a chance to find theCosmic Cubeshards, calling his attempts a wild goose chase. When Tony objects her,Giant-Mandecides to bring to light the fact that Tony never actually had the locations of the shards pinpointed.Ant-Mandecides to stop the discussion from escalating and reveal he is the mole. Back aboard the Hydra Helicarrier, Bruce rejects Captain America's offer, arguing that even though the superhero community did wrong by him numerous times, Hydra are fascist totalitarians while he's still an Avenger. Captain America expresses his disappointment Bruce didn't accept, but reveals he wasn't exactly talking to Bruce, whose eyes turn green. In The Mount, Ant-Man is confronted by his peers for his betrayal, so he reveals he was forced to work for Hydra because they had leverage on him in the form of his daughterCassie. They are interrupted when they see the Hulk jumping off the Helicarrier through the room's screens. He lands into The Mount, penetrating the fortress.\nHydra's troops soon follow the Hulk as he begins to rampage through the base. The sight of Hulk paralysesHawkeye, who recalls the events of Banner's death and kneels with his eyes closed while Hulk charges at him.The Thingtackles the jade giant, giving Mockingbird the opportunity to get Hawkeye out of harms way. Clint concedes that the superheroes deserve their current predicament, arguing it consist of the ghosts of their past coming back to haunt them. Mockingbird makes him snap out of it, pointing out that even though maybe they do deserve it, the civilians and innocent people don't, prompting Clint to get back on his feet and assist the evacuation efforts.\nGiant-Man deploys a set ofA.I.vengersto fend off the Hulk and Hydra while the Underground finishes evacuating the base. Outside the facility, Hawkeye and the rest are intercepted byOdinson, though he lets them board their jet.Sam Wilsonprepares for take off, while Mockingbird notices everybody managed to get out except Tony.\nInside The Mount, Iron Man prepares to leave, but Captain America takes him by surprise, latching to his armor's chestplate a device derived fromUltron's technology to weaken him and prevent him from transferring himself elsewhere. Iron Man and Captain America fight while the Hulk finishes off the A.I.vengers. The Hulk's temporary resurrection comes to an end, and he decays, collapsing the roof above Iron Man and Captain America. With his armor damaged from the cave-in, Tony activates the \"Clean Slate Protocol\" as Rogers approaches him in order to deliver the final blow. Tony begs him to wait, and apologizes to him. Aboard a Helicarrier,Madame Hydrabecomes aware of an unusual energy signature inside The Mount and rushes into the base. Stark recalls the grief he felt over Steve's death after the firstsuperhuman civil warand the feeling that he had failed Cap, explaining that when Steve returned, he swore to never fail him again, though he felt it happened again numerous times. Tony reveals this instance he felt he could've filled Steve's role of giving people hope and could've saved him, becoming to Steve what he always was to Tony, his hero. Elisa reaches Steve and uses a spell to banish him in the last second before Iron Man's armor detonates into a mushroom cloud, destroying himself, the base, and taking Elisa with it.\nBack in Maryland, Black Widow hears through a radio about the destruction of The Mount and the fact that no people appeared to have survived, and cries while pouring a glass of vodka. She then barges into the Champions' room to inform them about Hydra's victory, declaring that the next day they're going to kill Captain America."

After another failed attempt to pick up his hammer, Thor laments that it all it took was a whisper from Fury to make him unworthy of Mjolnir. Odin demands to know what Fury whispered but gets no response from his son. Freyja counsels her husband, suggesting that he tone down and talk to his son. The All-Father scoffs at the thought of \"coddling\" Thor and accuses her of going soft in his absence, to which she retorts that Asgardia had not fallen during that time. The Warriors Three interject that all of the Asgardians assembled could not budge Mjolnir, so maybe the fault lies with the hammer. As Freyja reminds Odin that it was he who placed the enchantment that gave that thing the power to decide who was worthy, Odin casts Thor aside and attempts to pick up his creation but to his frustration, even he, the enchanter, cannot move it. As Odin furiously blasts the hammer with his magic, Freyja comforts Thor, telling him that a weapon doesn't define him.\nSuddenly, Hugin and Munin, Odin's ravens, arrive to inform the All-Father of the presence of Frost Giants on Midgard. Odin orders his subjects to return to Asgardia, stating it's not their fight, though Freyja intends to march to war. Odin dismisses her order, declaring that her position as All-Mother is abolished with his return, though Freyja disagrees. Thor then rises up, announcing his intent to get a weapon and head home. Odin he means Asgardian and orders the Asgardians to head home. Freyja interjects that Thor is headed for Midgard and insists on restraining him given his weakened state, only for her husband to interrupt her, declaring that he will reassert his authority as the All-Father and Freyja will remember her place.  Freyja then stares at Mjolnir.\nBack on Earth, the Roxxon employees wonder what's going on. Suddenly, Malekith the Accursed appears behind them, explaining the nature of Frost Giants and that they've come for something in Roxxon's possession. He kills two men when they deny knowing what he's looking for, before the third man agrees to help. Then out of nowhere, Thor comes riding in on a goat, wielding Jarnbjorn against the Frost Giants. When he takes notice of Malekith, the dark elf humorously notes of a certain change in the Thunder God before slicing off his left hand. As the control room floods with seawater, Malekith casts a spell to allow him to breath while his Roxxon hostage drown. He then calls out to the giants, telling him he knows where to find their prize.\nBack on the Moon, an unidentified female says, \"There must always be a Thor.\" and grasps the hammer, which changes its inscription to \"Whosoever hold this hammer, ifshe be worthy, shall possess the power of... Thor\" and successfully lifts it off the ground.\n• The great hammer MJOLNIR lies on the moon, unable to be lifted by anyone in all the heavens! Even THOR!\n• Something dark has befallen the God of Thunder, leaving him weakened and for the first time in forever... UNWORTHY!\n• But when Frost Giants invade the Earth, the hammer will be lifted and an all-new Thor will arise! A Thor unlike any we've ever seen before!\n• Who is this new GODDESS OF THUNDER? Not even Odin knows!"

Matt Murdock was among the crowd, and noticed something was off with Tony, who also started drinking once more. At the Jean Grey School, the X-Men are revealing the unification of mutants as they also revealed their new agenda of no longer wanting co-existence between humans and mutants, but to stand above them, with the help of Evan Sabahnur, who had become Apocalypse due to the inversion. Back to the Avengers Tower, Captain America informed the team about the current whereabouts of the X-Men when they decided they should kill the Red Skull, and any opportunity of Charles Xavier still being alive inside him with him, in response to the mutant's claims. Both the Hulk and Jarvis tried to stop them, but were ignored and attacked. This caused a new persona to surface in Hulk called Kluh, who proceeded to attack the Avengers before fleeing the Tower stating his desire to cause destruction. After deciding that Kluh was not their problem as long as he didn't stand in their way, the Avengers opened the Red Skull's cell only to find that it was empty.\nACT II: INVERSION\n• The fate of the Red Skull decided.\n• A founding Avenger quits.\n• The birth of KLUH, the strongest one there is.\n• Doom tears down Latveria."

However, he swiftly knocks them all down with the power from the almost-completed Cosmic Cube.\nRogers blasts a wave of energy that wipes out the heroes and remakes the world into Hydra's image. Glimpses of this world include the Fantastic Four with Doctor Doom rather than Mr. Fantastic, Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr having been executed, the Avengers being assembled by Hydra, and Arnim Zola creating theradioactive spider. As the wave of energy envelops different landmarks ofWashington, D.C., they change their appearance. TheCapitolappears rebuilt, a statue ofNostradamusleans over the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, theWashington Monumentbecomes spiralled, andSir Isaac Newtonsits in the place ofAbraham Lincoln.\nSteve's prideful observation of the fruits of his labor is interrupted byCaptain America, still standing holding the last fragment of the Cosmic Cube.Ant-Manand theWinter Soldierobserve from behind as Sam walks up to Steve. Sam kneels in front of Rogers, and hands over the Cosmic Cube fragment as he gives the Hydra salute. Surprised, Steve accepts Sam's offering, though also demands he give him hisshield. Rogers pushes the shard into the chestpiece containing the rest. The surge of power flowing through Steve is abruptly cut short, and he falls into the ground, noticing the Cube is gone from his armor. Ant-Man appears in front of Rogers, returning from his miniature size. The Winter Soldier soon follows, returning to the scene through a portal.\nIt is shown that moments earlier, as Sam handed over the Cube fragment, Ant-Man helped Bucky go subatomic size and penetrate Rogers' chest piece when he inserted the fragment into it.\nEven earlier before, days prior at theTriskelion, the Winter Soldier was explaining a plan to Captain America, Hawkeye andIron Man. Believing that if the Cosmic Cube fragments were reunitedKobikwould bring herself back to life, Bucky explained that with her laid her memory of the realSteve Rogers, and that bringing him back was only a matter of managing to reach them.\nInside Kobik's mindscape, the world crumbled around Steve as he raced to find the little girl. Rogers found her sheltered inside a daycare, expressing her anguish over having messed up. Having believed Hydra was good, she unwittingly transformed Rogers into something horrible. When Kobik suggested remaining in hiding inside her mindscape, Steve shut down the idea, arguing the only way to face fascists is to stand and fight. Steve consoled Kobik, and she took his hand. As soon as they left the building, they heard Bucky's voice from above. The sky ripped open, and Bucky extended his hand to Steve. Carrying Kobik, Steve reached Bucky, and everything turned white.\nBack in the present, the Hydra Supreme angrily demands to know what Bucky did with the Cube. Kobik comes out of another portal, and reverts the changes Steve made to the world, much to his dismay. In front of the villainous Steve Rogers materialized the real Captain America. The two Rogers fight an arduous battle that is witnessed throughout the world. When the confrontation comes to a standstill, the Hydra Supreme reaches forMjolnirto lift it as he once did when his reign began. Little did he know that during said instance, in realityMadame Hydrahad used one of the Cosmic Cube fragments to alter Mjolnir's enchantment. Now as he attempts to lift it, the Hydra Supreme fails miserably. Captain America snatches away the hammer, and uses it to deliver his villainous counterpart a blow that knocks him out.\nAfter turning to his allies and apologizing for the actions of his evil counterpart, Steve hands over the shield back to Sam, and gives Mjolnir back toThor. Using her powers, Kobik restores the past as it originally was, and gifts several of the heroes on the scene a journey through theVanishing Point, seemingly returning immediately afterwards. Together again, all the heroes stand triumphant.\nSeveral weeks later, the sense of normalcy returned to the restored United States. Memorials are held, wreckage is rebuilt, and the dead are mourned, namelyBlack Widow.\nThe Inhuman prisoners previously freed from captivity inNew Attilanare processed by the American government.Brian McAllistersoon returns to his brotherJason, and they head home. Brian finds his house vandalized and thrashed, but he tucks Jason into bed before going to sleep himself. The following day, Brian is woken up by a noise outside.

Before leaving the car, Jason comments on the fact his classmateMarcus Festermanstole his lunchbox. Brian promises to get him a new one, and Jason asks for it to be aCaptain Americalunchbox, much to Brian's annoyance. Jason leaves for class while Brian looks up a lunchbox on his phone.\nOnce Jason arrives to the classroom and the bell rings, the students make theHydrasalute before starting the lesson. During lesson, the teacherMs. Peterscomments that Hydra has been burning history books to fit with Hydra's vision of past events, delving into the fact that during WWII the Allies allegedly rewrote reality, but Captain America returned to his true self and is helping the world do the same. A discussion abruptly starts between Jason and Marcus when the latter accuses the other's brothers of being a freak. At the McAllister's home, Brian rushes inside from his car, and disgorges an entire Captain America lunchbox, having apparently created it after looking an image of it. After knocking the door, Hydra soldiers break into the house and apprehend Brian on the grounds of him failing to register as anInhuman. Meanwhile, a kid arrives at a train station inLas Vegas.\nAt Earth's orbit, on the other side of thePlanetary Defense Shield,Captain Marveldesperately tries to punch her way back to the planet while a S.O.S. message she sent to outer space plays back.Alpha Flightis still being bombarded by armies ofChitaurisoldiers with no end in sight, and their defenses are all but broken.\nBack in Las Vegas, the kid is being chased by Hydra soldiers. Members of theUnderground, namelySpider-Man,Hulk,Viv,Falcon, andWasp, observe him from the distance to make sure he's the person they arranged a meeting with and proceed to rescue him. The boy can barely identify himself asRayshaun LucasbeforeIronheartalerts them aboutDreadnoughtsapproaching their location. Riri picks them up in aFantasti-Car MK II, and they fly away.\nInDenver, Captain America is confronted byKrigorrath, a monster from the depths who has returned from the depths to demand a sacrifice to sate his appetite. Captain America attempts to get him to leave by threatening him, but when Krigorrath brushes off his warning, Steve has theAvengerskill him.\nA newsreel showcases the effects of Hydra's take over of America. Citizens are celebrating the victory of the Avengers; crime has been reduced by 75%; the exchange market is hitting new heights due to Hydra's works program, which involves the generation of new job opportunities with the creation of projects such as a Dreadnought-manufacturing facility; a new trade agreement has been signed betweenMadripoorand the U.S.; and an estimate of twenty people are set to be executed for treason.\nAt a meeting with Hydra'sHigh Council,Doctor Faustusaddresses the use of mind-altering substances in water supplies across the entire country, mentioning a new formula is being created to increase the people's docility and receptiveness. When reporting on intelligence, Kraken observes the mutants displaced to the sovereign nation ofNew Tianare not trustworthy.Vipertalks about the opening of two new detention facilities to double the amount of Inhumans held in indefinite custody.\nBefore Captain America can end the meeting,Arnim Zolainforms him about the incident inNevadainvolving the Underground. Back at the scene, the Underground had managed to evade the Dreadnoughts after fixing the Fantasti-Car's boost drive. A video of this event made its way to Internet and amassed 50 million views before state censor took it down. Steve suggests issuing an statement, but his allies agree that other actions need to be taken, due to the increase of Underground activity in the area. Zola reproaches Rogers for having let all the rebel fighters free in the so-called \"Day of Peace.\" Steve replies that he doesn't want to oversee a prison state, and instead wants to unite its people. With the exception ofBaron Zemo, the other members of the Council are in the same line of thinking that Hydra should actually demonstrate their power by crushing the resistance before it's too late.\nBack with the young heroes, the Fantasti-Car arrives atThe Mount, where they are greeted byThe ThingandBlack Widow.Hawkeyescolds them for the exposure they garnered during their last outing. Natasha and Clint then confront Rayshaun, who reveals to have acquired allegedly vital piece of data fromErik Selvigto fix Captain America from none other thanRick Jones.\nAt Captain America's base, the hero-turned-Hydra-leader is trying to have dinner withSharon Carter, who remains outraged and indignant at him no matter his attempts to appease her. He tries to convince her to join him for the sake of the good they could do together, but Sharon retorts that even if what he's doing seems to work on the surface, it's not good because it's corrupted at the core. When Captain America insists he's the real Steve Rogers, Sharon demands him to prove it by doing at least one thing that'd remind her of the man she loved, that being to spare Rick Jones.\nIn a prison cell, Rick Jones' singing is interrupted by the arrival of Captain America. Rick had been relocated there after violating protective custody in his apartment by stealing the phone of a guard and using it to hack in and steal valuable files in Hydra's possession. Captain America tries to convince Rick to at least pretend to show loyalty for Hydra in order to be spared and say the salute, and Rick meets his request by continuing singing. As Steve leaves the cell, Rick promises to never give up hope, knowing Cap will endure whatever Hydra did to him because he's his hero. Rogers shows remorse as he walks away.\nBack at the Underground's base, Rayshaun is taken byGiant-Manto the laboratory of theTony Stark A.I., who is using pair of armor gauntlets to allow for physical contact to work on fixing equipment. Rayshaun gives him the device containing Rick Jones' information, but he completely ignores it, preferring to focus on the matters at hand, namely fixing the base's air conditioning. Rayshaun questions Tony's reaction, bringing up the fact Steve and Tony were supposed to be best friends, but Stark replies that was the case until he betrayed them. Tony then recounts two other instances in which trying to tackle Steve's situation ended in tragedy. Stark also suggests the data is false, arguing that Rick was under arrest even before the take-over started. Rayshaun tries to get to Tony one more time, telling him he can't give up because he's a superhero. Tony shuts him down, claiming that the Underground aren't heroes, they're simply fugitives who remember a little too well. As the situation is now, all they can do is survive. In the upper levels of The Mount, Hawkeye and Black Widow are observing the rest of the resistance. Natasha cherishes Clint's accomplishments by organizing and keeping the Underground afloat.\nInside a study room,Madame Hydrais using her powers to counterDoctor Strange's attempts to break free from the Darkforce surrounding Manhattan. Steve Rogers comes in and they proceed to talk over tea. Steve shares his concerns for Zola and Faustus' traces of disloyalty. She brushes them off, reminding Steve of the plan to use find theCosmic Cubeto restore the world to their vision. She suggests Rogers to show how he stands apart and above, indicating it's time he reclaimed what is his.\nWhile Captain America is broadcasting an announcement, Rick Jones is taken to a firing squad and executed, his last words being \"Avengers Assemble.\" Meanwhile, back in Nevada, the Underground is alerted when three Hydra Helicarriers descend from the sky and open fire onLas Vegas."

Yelling at the hammer, he tries to lift it but fails to so much as budge it. As he storms off, declaring that he no longer gives a damn about it and looking for a fight to take his mind off it, a time-portal opens up andMister Fantasticand theThingappear. Mistaking them for a sorcerer and atroll, Thor initially disbelieves him until they produceToothgrinder. Initially happy to see the Asgardian goat, Thor's good mood is immediately ruined when the Thing tells him to grab his hammer and get through the portal.\nIn the present day, Young Thor looks down in dismay at his future self - now missing an arm and an eye, theAll-Father Thorofthe distant future, andJane Foster- who regained her Thor powers using Ultimate Mjolnir. Approaching them, Young Thor recalls teaming up with his future selves againstGorr the God Butcherand recognizes \"the wench\" fromtheir previous encounter, grousing that he's the only one without a hammer. He angrily demands they stop standing around yammering and go to war, Jane expressing dismayed annoyance at his arrival. As All-Father Thor leads Young Thor away to talk to him, Jane asks Present-Day Thor why he picked his arrogant, hot-tempered younger self. Present-Day Thor replies that it wasFatethat chose his past self, and that without him none of them would exist.\nAll-Father Thor chastises Young Thor for being reckless and rushing into battle without knowing what he's up against, but Young Thor retorts that judging by All-Father Thor's appearance he'll live for billions of years yet. All-Father Thor acknowledges that he's far older than any god that's ever lived, but warns Young Thor that they're unmoored from their proper places in the timeline and the purview of their destinies - and thus any of them could be killed. Brushing All-Father Thor off, Young Thor declares that if that's the case they should die like Thors. Jane, Present Day Thor, and All-Father Thor agree, raising their hammers and summoning lightning - the former declaring they'll die with a hammer in their hands and thunder in their hearts. Belatedly realizing Young Thor doesn't have a hammer, Jane apologizes for being insensitive as Young Thor angrily storms off. declaring that he doesn't need a hammer, justJarnbjorn. The four Thors set off to fight Malekith, Young Thor riding on Toothgrinder to make up for his inability to fly. Mentally referring to himself as the greatest of all Thors and the other three as pale imitations, Young Thor scoffs that four Thors is overkill for a single elf and wonders how impressiveMalekithcould be.\nAtStonehenge, Malekith - having bonded to theVenom symbioteand used it to augmenthis acolytes- declares himself the Butcher of Thors and laughs maniacally. Horrified by the monstrous elf, Young Thor mentally notes they should've brought more Thors and that Malekith's \"Symbio Sword / Venom Blade\" isthe same type of weaponas Gorr'sAll-Black. As Present Day Thor attacks Malekith with theLast Hammer of Asgardand his Jarnbjorn, Jane freesOdinandFreyja- who Malekith had been holding captive, telling them she and the other Thors will handle Malekith and his Spider Elves. Odin is astounded by the three versions of their son, Freyja telling Jane they're not going anywhere. Young Thor and All-Father Thor fight back-to-back against the Spider Elves, sensing the manifestation of theGod Tempest. As Young Thor notes it still feels like something is missing, Present Day Thor flies past them and slams into a megalith, his hammer having been stolen by Malekith. As Malekith coats the weapon in living abyss and renames it the Black Hammer of the Accursed, Young Thor bitterly notes that even the elf gets a hammer.\nAll-Father Thor engages Malekith, declaring that the warlord could never lift Mjolnir even with the strength of a thousand elves. Flinging All-Father Thor aside with tendrils, Malekith realizes that Thor has summoned other versions of himself from the timestream as a means of circumventing his trap. Turning to Young Thor, Malekith verifies that he is the other Odinsons' past self before telling his minions to kill Young Thor and erase the others from existence. Despite the overwhelming odds, Young Thor throws himself at Malekith's Spider Elves, ignoring All-Father Thor telling him to fall back and shouting that he hates hammers. As he hacks apart Spider Elves, Young Thor laughs and notes that this is the best day in his life... right up until Malekith smashes the Black Hammer of the Accursed into his back. As Present Day Thor and All-Father Thor cry out in pain and stagger from the blow, Jane notes that whatever happens to Young Thor happens to them as well. All-Father Thor kills several Spider Elves with Mjolnir and intercepts Malekith, who mockingly asks what he's supposed to be the All-Father of when all Ten Realms belong to him. Wreathing himself in the Thor-Force, All-Father Thor declares that Malekith is his.\nNoticing All-Father Thor's Mjolnir pinning down a group of Spider Elves, Young Thor mentally notes that this must be why the Norns brought him here - to singlehandedly win the War of the Realms and attain everlasting glory; however, he's unable to lift the hammer and gets slashed by one of the Spider Elves for his trouble. Pulling him away before he can be further injured, Jane tells him to hide and sit out the fight so that he doesn't further endanger the others. Sulking, Young Thor decides to fight Malekith'sWild Huntinstead - not noticing the Spider Elves oozing out from underneath Mjolnir and amalgamating into a towering gestalt monster. As he fights, Young Thor laments at the realization that his reckless arrogance is shaming himself and endangering not just his own future but that of the Ten Realms and everything he holds dear.\nHearing Freyja scream, Young Thor turns to see her in the talons of the gestalt monster, which dubs itselfSvartalfvenom. As Svartalfvenom's jaws gape in preparation to devour his mother, Young Thor - heedless of his own safety - rushes to save the one parent who ever showed him genuine love and kindness, especially when he didn't deserve it. Acting on instinct and protective fury, Young Thor pummels Svartalfvenom and blasts it with bolts of divine lightning, belatedly realizing something feels different - not realizing that his selflessness enabled him to lift All-Father Thor's Mjolnir. As Thor and Freyja stare in astonishment, All-Father Thor - wielding Young Thor's Jarnbjorn - approaches and points out that Young Thor has his hammer, offering to let him keep it for the remainder of the battle and expressing pride in his youngest self for finally proving himself worthy. Noting that the hammer feels lighter than air, Young Thor gives it back to its rightful owner and takes his axe back, realizing that while he still cares about hammers, he's learned that it's important to care about things other than himself. Grinning as he turns to finish off Svartalfvenom, Young Thor concludes that this isn't the greatest day in his life - it's just another day, but that all days are great for him.\nWAR OF THE REALMS TIE-IN!"

Recognizing him from whenOdinhad visited the city millennia ago, theLord Librarianirritably recalls Thor had been a brat and wonders what he could possibly want now. Apologizing for the folly of his youth, Thor - putting up with several disparaging interruptions - explains that he has come seeking the names of gods who have mysteriously vanished. The Lord Librarian shows him to the Hall of the Lost, Thor is shocked and appalled by the countless number of books, tomes, and scrolls regarding vanished gods. The Lord Librarian brusquely remarks that gods come and go, and that most pantheons couldn't care less what became of rival groups - grumbling under his breath that he hopes Thor is among the forgotten. Thor informs him that many of the gods in the Hall of the Lost have been murdered, the Lord Librarian irritably snapping that the Hall of Murder has an entire wing devoted to his family. When Thor states he has to warn the Parliament, the Lord Librarian retorts that they're a 200-year waiting list. Using Mjolnir as a light source, Thor scans the thousands of tomes, wondering if the God Butcher was responsible for all of the gods chronologued therein disappearing.\nSeeking out the Oaken King and Sequoia Queen of Glenglavenglade - who have been missing for 2000 years - he finds them nailed to their divine tree and is promptly attacked by anothermonster made of living darkness. He next seeks out the War Fairies of Wendigorge, who were last seen 1200 years ago, finding their home reduced to a gore-strewn wasteland and fighting a third minion of the God Butcher. Each of the missing gods Thor seeks out turns out to be a victim of the God Butcher, who leaves a monster to guard their corpses. The carnage Thor witnesses - and the apathy of the other gods towards it - leads him to undergo an existential crisis regarding the worthiness of gods - himself included. Coming across the body of an alien god he'd known - Falligar, dead only five years - Thor blames himself for not killing the God Butcher when he had the chance. Slaughtering the monster left to guard Falligar's corpse, Thor shakes the solar system with his rage, vowing to make the God Butcher regret ever leaving him alive.\nIn the past, the young Thor awakens in a tent, surrounded by his Viking friends. One of them informs him that they found Thor grievously injured and alone, and that it took seven days for him to recover. Informed that the God Butcher survived, Thor leaves in search of him; ignoring his Viking followers proclaiming that Odin and the armies of Asgard will march forth and bring their wrath down upon the one who foolishly attacked the Prince of Asgard. Hearing a voice call out to him, Thor comes across the mortally-wounded Hinkon, the Siberian God of the Hunt, who tells Thor that the God Butcher ambushed him and left him alive to tell Thor that he was waiting for Thor in a cave along the lake. Hirkon tells Thor he should not have come alone and asks Thor to put him out of his misery. Vowing to avenge him, Thor complies.\nIn the present, Thor returns to Lake Ladoga, Russia, accompanied by Iron Man - who uses his suit's sensors to locate the specific cave Thor is looking for. Stark asks Thor if he needs the Avengers to back him up, unnerved by the fear in Thor's gaze, before remarking that Thor is probably going to tell him this business concerns only the divine. Thor tells him to wait, saying that the last time he was there he went alone out of foolish pride and nearly died, telling Iron Man hedoesneed his help before sending him to warn the Olympian pantheon and other gods of Earth. Lamenting he hoped to never see this place again, Thor enters the cave. Flashing back to his first visit there, Thor notes that despite his relative youth he has lived for thousands of years and that many of his memories have faded; admitting he's ashamed to have forgotten many of the mortals he befriended during his petulant youth. Entering the cave of the God Butcher for the first time in a thousand years, Thor bitterly thinks to himself that he will remember this cave until the end of time. Contacting Freyja, Thor tries to warn her about the God Butcher, but is distracted by the sound of stones being disturbed and attacks.\nIn the 9th century, the young Thor stands at the mouth of the cave and calls out to the God Butcher to face him. Mocking him for his arrogance in coming alone, the God Butcher attacks Thor with tendrils of living darkness - restraining him and pulling him into the cave.\nIn the present, Thor grabs a four-eyed alien god with pale green skin, initially mistaking him for the God Butcher due to their similar appearance. The god explains he was hiding from the God Butcher - real name Gorr - in the last place he'd think to look; telling Thor that everything Gorr is doing is because of what Thor did to him.\nIn the distant future, Thor dives into the black ocean of Gorr's minions. He fights valiantly but is overcome, his body sinking beneath the tide of living darkness.\n• Following the bloody wake of murdered gods across the depths of space, Thor tracks the God Butcher into the present!"

Having had a vision prophesying that the ancient dark god's resurrection will lead him to victory, the god takes a flask of the sap ofYggdrasill- which has the power to restore anything to life - and pours it into the corpse's open chest cavity.\nInManhattan,Jane FosterandLisa Halloranchat about their respective love-lives; Lisa gushing about how romanticAmerica Chavezis and scolding Jane for missing a date with a \"cute-but-boring\" banker to foil an attemptedKree Empireinvasion. As Lisa asks Jane how her budding romance withSam Wilsonis going, Jane senses an oncoming danger and activatesUndrjarn the All-Weapon, telling Lisa to get help. Transforming into Valkyrie, she sees the surrounding people are marked for death, with floating black bubbles emblazoned with skulls over their heads.\nA massive crevice rips open the street, Valkyrie worrying that she'll end up having to ferry an entire city block's worth of people to the afterlife and noting how cold the air feels. As Valkyrie watches in horror, a horde of monsters made of dirt and living darkness surges from the fissure. Manifesting wings, Valkyrie attempts to fly away, but is swarmed by the monsters, and as the darkness begins to infect her she notes the sensation is the same as when she was dying of cancer. Manifesting a razor-edged whip, Valkyrie frees herself and lashes out at the monsters, scattering them.Mr. Horsearrives and apologizes for being late, Valkyrie climbing onto his back and retracting her wings.\nAsCaptain Americabattles against a horde of monsters astride his motorcycle,Iron Maninforms him that the other Avengers are tied up suppressing similar occurrences around the globe. As Iron Man mockingly asks if Captain America will be alright by himself, Valkyrie joins the fray and warns Captain America not to let the monsters touch him.Doctor StrangeandSpider-Manarrive as well, Iron Man lamenting that he's missing a team-up fight. Doctor Strange notes the monsters are manifested from an ancient dark magic outside his expertise, attempting to contain them with a magic barrier despite Valkyrie cautioning him to stop.\nAs the monsters merge into a gestalt entity and break free, Jane spots a man being attacked by a worm-like monster and Captain America tells her to go take care of him while they stop the gestalt monster. As it lunges towards them,All-Father Thorsmites it with a bolt of lightning and greets them. Thor asks if the attack is over, and Captain America replies that they seem to strike in waves, Iron Man chiming in to say that based on his readings the next horde will strike in a couple of minutes. Captain America asks if Valkyrie is one of Thor's vassals and Thor introduces her as an old friend, the group turning to see Jane Foster in her human form, kneeling over the body of the infected man. Distraught that she had been unable to save him despite being a doctor, Jane sheds tears of remorse.\nIron Man reports that based on his analysis of the dirt comprising the creatures they originate from deep underground. As she closes his eyes, Jane states that the darkness seeks out life and infects it, corrupting and smothering it. Iron Man corroborates this, saying he'll study its mutagenic properties. Comforting Jane, Captain America tells Iron Man to shut up. Doctor Strange admits that both his magical and medical expertise are useless in this case, Jane stating that the darkness is infecting the Earth like a disease. Transforming into Valkyrie, she states that they need to cut it off at its source, Thor offering to join her while Captain America says he and the others will hold the line against the waves of monsters, noting that he'd suspected Jane was the new Valkyrie all along.\nAs the next wave of monsters surges from the crevice, Valkyrie and Thor descend into the Earth. Sensing the deaths of each person killed, Valkyrie tells Thor that the monsters don't only kill the body, but the soul as well, which as a psychopomp causes her unbearable discomfort. Thor laments being unable to help shoulder her burden, Valkyrie thanking him and complementing his grizzledOdin-esque appearance. Taking her awkward complement in stride, Thor states that Jane looks unparalleled and like she's found where she belongs; Valkyrie wryly stating that she can see more than a little of the prince in the king before asking if he'd rather be up at the surface fighting dirt-monsters.\nSmashing a bat-like monster as it tries to ambush them, Thor agrees that smiting monsters is a favorite pastime of his, but that he is bound by his duty as the All-Father - admitting that being the king is more difficult and lonelier than he'd thought it would be. As Thor states that he's worried he should have seen this coming, Valkyrie asks if he knows what the dirt-monsters are. Thor states that while he doesn't know what the monsters are they remind him of an old Asgardian legend, and that he needs to trust his instincts - which means trusting a Valkyrie's. As Thor uses Mjolnir to bore a tunnel straight down, Valkyrie senses the fight taking place on the surface and laments how helpless she feels. As they reach a cavern, Thor states that they're close and she asks him what legend the monsters reminded him of.\nCenturies ago, when Thor had been a child, Odin had brought him to theBarren MountainsinJotunheim. Pointing to a mountain spider-webbed with black vein-like markings, Odin told Thor that when life emerged at the beginning of time, a font of eldritch darkness and anti-life manifested and was dubbed theRokkvaby the ancientAsgardians. As life flourished across theNine Realms, the Rokkva - a mindless force of corruption and death - grew in power as well.\nØde, one of the first kings, had sought to harness the Rokkva and for a time had succeeded, becoming one of the most powerful beings in all the Realms; however, the Rokkva had corrupted Øde physically and mentally until nothing was left in him but evil, ultimately destroying his very soul. What remained of Øde - little more than a blackened husk serving as a vessel for the Rokkva - was sealed away beneath the mountain using ancient magics even Odin cannot fathom. Odin tells Thor that it is the duty of the All-Fathers to ensure that the Rokkva never escapes its prison and that one day it will be Thor's duty as well. Thor cheerfully states that if that were to ever occur he would kill it, Odin smiling at his son's innocent naïvety and saying he has much to learn.\nThor and Valkyrie arrive at the chamber containing the body of the dark god, twisted tendrils of living darkness emerging from his chest cavity and snaking across the ground. As Thor grimly states the body shouldn't be there, Valkyrie asks if it's the Rokkva. Thor replies that if it were they would already be dead, and that the corpse is none other than King Øde himself. Thor notes that someone tried to use the sap of Yggdrasil to resurrect Øde, but that since his soul had been devoured by the Rokkva before his death, the ritual had backfired and instead caused the Rokkva to metastasize like cancer, spilling out of Øde's body and infecting the Earth.\nHorrified, Valkyrie asks who would do such a thing, Thor replying that whoever it was had no clue about the dangers of the ancient magics they were meddling with. Raising Mjolnir, Thor attempts to destroy Øde's corpse, Jane shouting at him to wait. Tendrils of living darkness erupt from Øde's body and coil around Mjolnir, engulfing Thor before he can react. As Valkyrie watches in horror, Thor - his skin turning pale grey with black veins, hair silvery-grey, and eye jet black with a pupil-less yellow iris - turns to face her, wreathed in black lightning.\nODE TO THE DEATH OF MIDGARD!"

Working with tech geniusDavid Lieberman aka Microchip, together they have come up with various pieces of technology to help him in his war on crime.[1]\nFrank Castle mostly used conventional firearms, explosives, and knives. He collected most of his weapons from dead criminals. He keeps his equipment in safe-houses across the country.[citation needed]He cleans and services his weapons every other morning. He liked to use anM60 machine guna weapon he used in theVietnam War, it was nicknamed the \"Hog\",[citation needed]along with anUzi 9mm.[citation needed]His former military weapon of choice was a standard issueM16A1.[citation needed]Due to his extensive use of the rifle since war, Castle used anM16A3fitted with anM203 grenade launcher, even though he hates5.56 Ammunition. His backup firearm is aDerringer D32. His chosen type of knife is aGerber Mk2.[citation needed]\nHe customizes his weapons for greater effectiveness with both standard and custom items including magnified optics, reflex sights, night vision scopes, flashlights, grenade launchers, sound and flash suppressors, bipods, high-capacity magazines and drums and various ammunition including hollow point or armor piercing bullets.[citation needed]\nPunisher usually usedrubber \"mercy bullets\" (non-lethal ammunition)when he worked withDaredevil,[citation needed]Spider-Man,[2]andCaptain America[3]\nCastle chose not to utilize any costume outside of a black shirt with awhite skull splashed across the front. His other clothing, which sometimes included combat boots, blazers, leather jackets, trench coats,Kevlar vests and body armor, black battle dress uniforms, and camouflage outfits was worn for the sake of protection or camouflage in urban and wilderness areas.[citation needed]Each tooth of the skull was actually spare ammunition for firearms.[4]Microchip helped createPunisher's Exo-Armor, a battlesuit which he used against theReavers.[5]\nPunisher once harbored a Symbiote-lite exosuit based on the alien entity known asVenomcreated byStuart Clarke.[6]This Venomech System exomantel dubbed the Synthiote; simulated all the protective, reformulating and enhancement properties naturally bestowed by an alien Symbiote. Minus their recuperative biomass as it lacked the self-perpetuating ability to restore its substance with every blow taken, what it did have was the ability to magnify Frank's physical abilities as well as change appearances in order to generate guns out of it's artificial Constituent-Matter.[6]\nMicrochip created for him theBattle Van[7]along with other armored vehicles such as theThe Fury,[8]motorcycles, helicopters and other aircraft and even a robot called \"Dalek\".[9]\nUsed to have a pet Rottweiler named\"Max\", whom he saved from animal poachers.[10]Also had a pet coyote named\"Loot\", whom he saved from gang members.[11]\nWhenStuart Clarkebecame Castle's personal hacker they gained access to a cache ofS.H.I.E.L.D.technology and confiscated weaponry such as theSatan Claw[12]He has been using aS.H.I.E.L.D. Flight Packfor many years.[13]\nWhen he began working withHenry Russothey began to collect custom gear from both heroes and villains such asPumpkin Bombs,[14]aGoblin Glider,[14]Pym Particles,[15]Ant-Man's Helmet,[15]Doctor Octopus' Tentacles,[16]Hawkeye's BowandTrick Arrows,[17]Captain America's Shield,[17]etc. He also later stole a prototypeIron Man Armorand booby-trapped it to snare Iron Man after blastingSpider-Manand flyingRachel Cole-Alvesto safety.[18]\nSome time after the Secret Invasion wherein Norman Osborn ascended to power, Castle added some alien artillery to his vast arsenal; e.i. a Skrull Sniper Rifle which can make an in impressive kill shot from several miles away.[19]"

Touching the amulet would summon his uniform and bestow the power of Captain Britain upon him.[1]The quarterstaff that originally came with the uniform was upgraded byMerlyninto aStar Sceptre, containing mystical circuitry that enabled him to fly.[2]\nAfter a time, Merlyn altered the uniform again, incorporating the mystical circuitry of the Sceptre into the costume, costing the Captain his weapon but also allowing him to fly hands free.[3]Not long after that, Captain Britain was killed by theFury. When Merlyn resurrected him, he gave Braddock the ability to naturally soak up the inter-dimensional energies that powered his costume, giving him the power of Captain Britain even out of uniform. The uniform still had an independent force field for further protection, and enhanced Brian's ability to harness the energies properly.[4]\nYears later, Captain Britain learned his uniform had an additional capability he wasn't aware of. His natural ability to process inter-dimensional energies only functioned in Great Britain, where the energies originated. Leaving theBritish Islesfor an extended period of time caused Braddock to lose his powers. The uniform acted as an antenna for these mystical energies, allowing Captain Britain to receive them anywhere in the world and retain his powers so long as he was wearing the costume.[5]\nAfter being lost in the wild timestream for months,[6]Brian Braddock returned in a new uniform calling himself Britanic.[7]Britanic demonstrated the ability to operate for extended periods of time in America[8]and France[9]with no noticeable loss to his powers. Whether this meant his altered garments still functioned like his old uniform, or if he no longer needed an \"antenna\" is unknown.\nBritanic later returned to using his Captain Britain uniform, having improved the mystical circuitry to command a greater control over his force field.[10]\nRecently, Captain Britain was killed and resurrected again as an extension of the spirit of the British people. His powers are fully natural, but wax and wane with his confidence and determination.[11]Modifying his old costume again, Braddock has used his own energies to power it with new features such as mystical sensors or a stealth feature.[12]"

Its inhabitants are theVanir, who are the sister race to theAesirofAsgard; sired long ago byNjord, who had taken a group of Asgardians to settle Vanaheim.[1]\nThe Vanir were masters of sorcery and magic.[citation needed]They are also widely recognized for their talent to predict the future.[citation needed]\nCity of Vanaheim\nThe realm is filled with vast forests, fields, and planes. It has become home to various other races such asRock TrollsandOgres.[citation needed]\nMalekith the Accurseddescribed the realm as \"filled with dusty old gods and enough trees to build a bonfire the size of the sun\".[2]\nThe realm is also filled with the ruins of gigantic, mountain-sized castles and citadels,[3]known as the \"ruins of Vanaheim\"[4]or as the \"abandoned city of the Vanir\".[5]\nVanaheim is represented in theCongress of Worldsby two Vanir senators.[2]Freyjarepresented her homeworld on the council for a while.[6]\nThe First God,Buri, bore three sons calledBor,Mimir, andNjord. Bor and his sonsOdin,Ve, andVilifounded the race known as theAesir, while Njord left and sired theVanirand foundedVanaheim.[1][7]\nOn the Plains of Vanaheim, the Asgardians battled theFrost Giantsfor nine months. But when the Frost Giants finally retreat, when\"Thor\"appeared and in front ofBalder the Brave, began killing Asgardians before leaving.[8]\nIn their early history, the Vanir built gigantic castles mountain-sized and citadels that could be seen from worlds away.[3]\nThey later grew weary of the warfare required to defend them, and decided to return into the forest, leaving their towers to fall apart,[3]known as the \"ruins of Vanaheim\".[4]\nA few stories happened in Vanaheim, including the encounter ofOld Lokiand youngOdinwithHriedmarand his sonsOtr the changer of shapes,Fafnir the greedy, andRegin the vengeful, leading to the creation of the swordGramand the later death of Regin and Fafnir atSigurd's hand.[9]\nThe young king Odin of theAesirtried to force the union of the two tribe, and went to war withFreyrand the people of Vanaheim. Seemingly over a matter of pride, Freyr refused to bend. He received support fromSurturofMuspelheim. The war ultimately ended with a peace treaty and marriage between the two royal families, as Odin was betrothed to Freyr's daughterFreyja. Their union marked the union of the two people.[10]\nDuringRagnarök, Thor gathered the citizens of Asgard and headed to Vanaheim, where to either rebuilt the city or make a final stand. They eventually reached Vanaheim, under attack byFenrisandDurok.Beta Ray Billreturned,[11]and was left him to protect the realm while he continued his mission.[12]\nWhile investigatingHeimdall's ObservatoryThor,Steve Rogers, andIron Manwere sucked into the portal, each waking up on different areas of the Nine Realms. Thor awoke in a deserted Vanaheim,[13]affected byHela's machinations, and was soon attacked by theEnchantress,[13]who accused him of being the cause of the Realms imbalance (having broughtAsgardonMidgard). He was then attacked by Hela, who attempted to use the imbalance to unite the Realms under her rule.[14]Thor, Amora, and Hela all ended up knocked out in the fight, with the two witches transported elsewhere withMjolnir,[15]while Thor was retrieved in Vanaheim by Rogers and Stark.[16]\nTheWar of Burningstarted across the Nine Realms, but truly erupted whenLeahwent to Vanaheim and proposedSurtur's technology to Vanaheim stewardGullveig, who then burned down theTemple of Union.[17]The Asgardians (Aesirand loyal Vanir alike) attacked Vanaheim while the rebel Vanir invaded all of the realms.[18]\nA group ofDark Elvesrefugees went to Vanaheim to hide in the ruins, but were slaughtered byMalekith. They were soon found back Thor who traveled to Vanaheim with theLeague of Realms.[3]\n\nWhenBaron Zemoused theNorn Stones;Hulkwas transported to Vanaheim.[19]Hulk still had theBloodaxewas attacked by a group ofOgreswho had the Vanir imprisoned but the green monster took care of them with a powerful thunderclap. He was thanked by theWarriors Threebecause of his immense strength and \"gift of battle\".[20]\nFalcon showed Hawkeye his upgraded weaponry for the group, when an Asgard rune transported them to Vanaheim. Once there, a Shadow Nyx drained the electricity from it and they were saved byFreya. Falcon managed to repel the Shadow Nyxe from overtaking Vanaheim by restarting the great light that kept them at bay.[21]"

She also uses the portal for theJotunheim Strikeforceto return withThorfromJotunheimto theAvengers Mountain, where the allies are assembling. The headquarters is being besieged by enemies, but they are repelled afterShuriactivates the base's weaponry underBlack Panther's orders.\nMalekithhas theVenom symbiotesubdued with magical restrains inStonehenge, and begins to use magic to tame it. Recovered but still hurt,Odinsets out to rescue Freyja from Svartalfheim. Before she can destroy the Black Bifrost, Malekith emerges from a portal and wounds her with the Venom symbiote, turned intoa sword. Odin arrives, clad in theIron All-Father Armor, and they fight by side, seemingly perishing after blowing up the Black Bifrost. Thor attaches the left arm of theDestroyerto his missing arm to replace his lost prosthetic, and interruptsJane Foster's gathering of the assembled troops to declare that he will lead the fight.\nIn the ruins ofAlfheim,Queen Aelsa Featherwine of the FayandSir Ivory Honeyshotready their weapons as aBlack Bifrostportal opens. ThePunishersteps through and is confronted by the two light elves. Despite being held at point-blank gunpoint by Honeyshot, the Punisher coldly informs them that he's not a servant ofMalekithand is working forAll-Mother Freyja, offering them a chance at revenge.\nInAsgard, a dark elf calls out toBitterhandto open the Black Bifrost and send reinforcements, but is knocked out byDaredevil, who apologizes toHeimdallfor his lapse in attentiveness allowing the Bifrost to be destroyed.All-Mother Jane Fosterasks Daredevil if he was able to hold the Bifrost open long enough for their strikeforces to return home, but Daredevil says he wasn't and that they must pray to Freyja that they can still hold the Black Bifrost.\nInSvartalfheim, Freyja kills Bitterhand and claims his cursed sword, theBitterblade, becoming the Guardian of the Black Bifrost. Wreathed in dark energy and her eyes turning purple with black sclerae, Freyja states she has been given all-sight for everything dark and evil, and that she foresees more dark elves dying to her blade. Freyja ordersHulkthrough the portal, but Hulk refuses - wanting to smash more elves. Freyja tells her that she's powerful enough to hold off all of Svartalfheim, and when Hulk still refuses to leave her Freyja impatiently conjures a portal around her and teleports her away. As thousands of dark elves swarm the bridge, Freyja declares that she'll kill all of them.\nInNidavellir, Hulk reduces the dwarves to tears with a short, brusque three-sentence command to follow her and smash everything. InVanaheim,Bladerecruits theVanirto take revenge on Malekith for razing their sacred forests and defiling their temples. InNiffleheim,Ghost Riderrecruits theSpiders of Hel, quipping that he didn't think his life could get any more metal. InJotunheim, Captain America escorts his strikeforce andThorthrough a Black Bifrost portal,Spider-Mantrying to rescueWolverinefrom aFrost Giant. The strikeforce arrives inAvengers Mountainto find it under seige fromFire Demons, Frost Giants, and other monsters,T'ChallainstructingShurito unleash the power of theProgenitoron their enemies. Shuri is left awestruck as the Celestial's corpse annihilates the horde. Captain America orders for Thor to be sent to the infirmary, but his debriefing of Ghost Rider is interrupted byAll-Father Odin, who staggers into the room furiously demanding to know where his wife is.\nCarving a swath through the dark elf army, Freyja lists the ongoing travesties she's witnessing -Valkyrielying dead inManhattan,Captain Marveland theAgents of Atlasfighting Fire Goblins in China, Thor's injuries being treated, theVenom symbiotebeing tortured byMalekith, and even back through time to Malekith's own hellish childhood as a corpse-burner; stating that he will never stop fighting until he has won, but neither will they. In Manhattan,King Laufeyperches on the ruins of the Statue of Liberty and laughs, swatting fighter jets out of the sky as they attack him.\nInStonehenge, Malekith smirks and gloats to the Venom symbiote, which he has restrained with dark magic. Remarking that ancient ruins like Stonehenge are resplendent with old magic, Malekith gleefully states that Midgard is the best realm to make war in, mockingly addressing the symbiote as \"Sir Venom.\" The Venom symbiote snarls insults at Malekith, who uses his magic to torture it while lamenting its impudent arrogance. Stating that it's been bonded to a mortal host for far too long, Malekith declares his intent to use the Venom symbiote for the purpose thatKnullfirst intended: as a weapon to slay gods. As the symbiote screams, Malekith calls out to Bitterhand to send him some wine wenches so that he can drink while he bends the symbiote to his will. Hearing no reply, Malekith realizes that something has gone wrong in Svartalfheim.\nIn the Avengers Mountain, Odin berates Captain America for letting his wife go to Svartalfheim and leaving her there to die. Captain America states that those were his orders, suggesting they use the Black Bifrost portal to go to Svartalfheim and rescue her. Odin vetoes that, saying that as its Guardian Freyja would never let any of them through if she doesn't wish it. Odin states that as the All-Father, he's the only one who can make the trip, telling them to bring himGungnir.Tony StarkandScrewbeardarrive, saying they have something better than a spear: a suit of powered armor forged with dwarven magic and re-enforced with Wakandan Vibranium. Telling Stark to shut up, Odin snaps that it had better be good at killing elves.\nIn Svartalfheim, Freyja notes that the strikeforces have all made it back and now have mystical allies to aid them in retaking Midgard. She turns to destroy the Black Bifrost, but is stabbed by a dagger of living abyss - the Venom symbiote reshaped into aNecroswordin emulation ofAll-Black. Stepping through the Black Bifrost portal, Malekith says that she may be its Guardian, but that he is master of Svartalfheim and everything in it. Freyja stares down at the blade impaling her and asks Malekith what kind of foul weapon it is, Malekith responding that it is one that will kill her once and for all. Freyja prepares to slash him with the Bitterblade, but Malekith gestures and the Venom symbiote restrains her with tendrils. As Malekith orders his troops to feed Freyja to his dogs, Odin - clad in Stark's \"Iron All-Father\" armor emerges from the portal, blasting Malekith and his elves aside with beams of energy. Freyja incredulously remarks on the gaudy gold-and-red suit before refusing to leave, saying they have to destroy the Black Bifrost. Freyja tells Odin to leave her, but he refuses - saying they'll die together and be reunited in Hel. As they stand back to back, Freyja wryly remarks that they've been married for thousands of years and only now does he turn her on. Stabbing the Bitterblade into the ground, Freyja self-destructs the Black Bifrost; Malekith unable to do anything but watch in outrage and scream ineffectual orders. As the Black Bifrost explodes, Freyja and Odin lean in to kiss each other but are engulfed by the blast before they can do so.\nIn Avengers Mountain, Thor enters the armory to find the Punisher distributing firearms to the light elves. As the elves bow to him and even the Punisher gives his condolences, Thor retrieves his prosthetic arm. Jane Foster delivers a speech, stating that Odin and Freyja are presumed dead and the Black Bifrost gone, but that this means that Malekith's army can no longer be re-enforced while they have aid from across the Nine Realms. Wielding a spiked hammer andJarnbjorn, Thor bursts into the hall, interrupting Jane's speech and declaring that he will lead the battle against Malekith's forces."

The corpse was refurbished by the finest architects fromWakandaand technicians fromAlpha Flightto make the mountain livable so it could serve as the Avengers' new headquarters.[1]\nDuring a battle between theCouncil of Red's multiversalMasters of Evil, a badly-damagedDeathlokunit uploaded his consciousness into the Celestial's corpse.[2]\nTo prevent all-out war between theEternalsandmutants,Ajak,Makkari,Mister Sinister, andIron Mancombined their knowledge to reanimate the Progenitor's corpse and reprogram its consciousness to create a new Celestial that would stop the war, sacrificing Avengers Mountain in the process. However, the new Celestial deemed the sentient life of Earth to be unworthy and gave them twenty-four hours to change its mind or be destroyed.[9]Eventually, the heroes convinced the new Progenitor that it itself is unworthy to pass judgment, which caused it to undo everything and returned to its old form as Avengers Mountain.[10]\nAvengers Mountain in the God Quarry as the base of the Multiversal Avengers\nThe Avengers used the Celestial's teleporter to go back in time to combat theCouncil of Red.[11]During this time, the Deathlok that uploaded himself into Avengers Mountain earlier came online. Remodelled into a Deathlok, it went to theGod Quarryto fight alongside the Avengers againstMephistoandDoom Supreme.[3][4]After the battle was over, it stayed in the God Quarry with the Deathlok's master,Avenger Primeand hisMultiversal Avengers, as their new base.[5]\nThe Avengers Mountain comes equipped with living headquarters for each member of the team, a gym, a laboratory, and docks for ships. Every floor of the building is connected through a sophisticated elevator called the Spinal Lift.[1]The Avengers managed to partially reanimate the Progenitor's circulatory system and use the cosmic energy from its blood cells to turn one of the ventricles of its heart into a teleportation hub with global reach called the Circulator. The remains of the Celestial's cerebrum were retrofitted into a server room called the Brain Room, which houses the most powerful computer terminal in the galaxy with the potential to decrypt countless bytes of data stored within the brain tissue. Each finger of the Progenitor's right hand was turned into a personalized hangar[12]and the intestinal tract remodeled into a detention facility.[13]"

He is Lord ofLongrose Hall, Baron of theOrder of the Petalbladeand the First Cavalier in theRoyal DragoonofQueen Featherwine of the Fay.[2]\nHoneyshot was recruited to represent his people into theLeague of Realms, a team uniting warriors of theNine Realmsin order to hunt downMalekith the Accursedwhile he was slaughtering his people across the Nine Realms. That team was assembled asThordesired to lead an army ofAsgardians, but such action was considered an illegal incursion on the Realms. The team consisted ofScrewbeardofNidavellir,Ud the Troll,Lady WaziriaofSvartalfheim, andOggyofJotunheim.[2]\nThe League was first sent in Nidavellir to protect the Dark Elves' Queen in exile,Alflyse, but their inability to work together properly led to their inability to defend her.[2]\nThe League clashed with Malekith's forces multiple times, eventually managing to save refugees inAlfheim, slaughtering Dark Elves refugees, but once again Malekith slipped away.[3]\nIn order to prevent his League from falling apart in front of him, Thor had the group headed to the nearest tavern, where Thor and Ogg engaged in a drinking contest, while the others wagered on the winner, narrowly drinking the giant under the table.[3]\nThe next day, the League headed toJotunheimwhere Malekith was hunting down a group of Elves who hided among the Mountain Giants. Oggy was directly targeted by the Accursed, who leaped into his mouth and brutally slashed apart the Giant's brain with his blades, felling him.[3]\nHaving gone to the Frost Giants for help, Malekith was out of reach of the League of Realms. Enraged, the others had to hold Thor back to prevent an incursion inside the Frost Giants territory and a larger conflict. After burying Oggy, the League went toVanaheimand found more Elves dead, slain fighting amongst themselves. Thor realized that there was to be a traitor in their midst.[4]\nThor cast a spell[1]and, accusing Ud of being the traitor, seemingly executed him against Honeyshot and the League's advices.[4]Ud was transported elsewhere in Vanaheim with a note addressed to the League pinned to his backside and leading them to the Midgard location of theDark Elvesrefugees.[1]\nThat rash action caused the league to split, with only Lady Waziria as companion to Thor. While the two of them headed toMidgardto find theCouncil of the Unhallowed, the Dark Elf ruling council in hiding, and urged them to unite against Malekith,[4]the rest of the League found Ud, as confused as them.[1]\nBack in Midgard, Thor accused Waziria of being a traitor as Malekith had followed them to the butcher shop. Enraged, she blasted Thor with a mystical bolt, resulting in a strange creature wrenching itself from inside of Thor, revealing that Malekith had been ahead of the League all along by bugging Thor.[4]The League then showed up with Ud. As Screwbeard was about to killed by his own dynamite stabbed into his hand, Ud saved him by cutting his hand off. Alongside with Thor and the Dark Elves, they took down Malekith, but the fight was stopped by the Council decision to have him their king.[1]"

The druids were eventually slaughtered by Roman Legionnaires, but before their deaths, they called upon Samhain for aid. In response, Samhain granted them the gift of \"Death.\"[7]\nIn 1666 A.D., Dormammu used Stonehenge as a portal to return to Earth, resulting in the Great Fire ofLondon. His goal was to steal the life-force of humans connected to theDark Dimension. Dormammu was ultimately defeated by theSorcerer Supreme,Yao.[8]\nPortal toOtherworld\nIn recent times, Umar invaded Earth, and the Ancient One took her to Stonehenge for a duel to prevent innocent lives from being harmed. There, the Ancient One and his disciple,Doctor Strange, summoned the powerful monsterZomto drive Umar away to theDark Dimension. Zom, however, turned on the Ancient One and Doctor Strange.[5]To give Strange a fighting chance, the Ancient One willingly melted into the local menhirs, surrendering his power. Following the Ancient One's counsel, Doctor Strange cut off Zom's mystic topknot, which attracted the attention of theLiving Tribunal. The Tribunal banished Zom and, in the process, sentenced Earth to destruction to prevent a magical plague from spreading.[9]However, Strange convinced the Tribunal to allow him to resolve the crisis. The Tribunal placed theGlass of Doomat Stonehenge, and both Strange and the Ancient One departed.[10]When the Tribunal was satisfied with Strange’s resolution, the Ancient One reappeared, explaining that he had willingly accepted the prison in order to increase Strange’s power to defeat Zom. The Ancient One shattered his binding spell once the cosmic balance was restored.[11]\nLater, Ard-Con, who had been imprisoned, broke free and rampaged throughEngland, planning to use Stonehenge to depart Earth.[1]\nTheBlack Knight, following an order from hisancestor, visited Stonehenge to destroy hisebony bladethrough magical means. There, he was confronted by an old woman who transported him toPolemachusto find an enchanted well capable of destroying his sword.[12]The Black Knight, accompanied byAragorn, returned by the end of the night and went back toGarrett Castle.[13]\nWhen the barriers between Earth and Otherworld began to collapse, a multi-headedHydraappeared above Stonehenge from Earth's side, having pierced the veil fromAvalon, signaling the weakening of the barrier between the realms.[14]"

Bor and his sonsOdin,VeandVilifounded the race known as theAesir, while Njord left, sired theVanirand foundedVanaheim.[12][verification needed][13]\nIn their early history, the Vanir built gigantic castles mountain-sized and citadels that could be seen from worlds away. They later grew weary of the warfare required to defend them, and decided to return into the forest, leaving their towers to fall apart,[3]known as the \"ruins of Vanaheim\".[14]\nFreyrlater became the leader of the Vanir.[15]\nIn his youth, Odin and the time-travellingOld Lokimet with an human-sized otter whom Loki killed and crafted two fur coats from. Arriving to theinnofHriedmarof the Vanir, they soon learned that the otter was Hriedmar's sonOtr the changer of shapes. As Loki settled the debt with gold (stolen fromAndvari, who had cursed it) and left with Odin, Hriedmar's sonFafnir's greed was revealed by the curse: he killed Hriedmar, left his brotherReginfor dead, and departed with the gold.\nRegin's violence was revealed by the curse as well, and he swore vengeance upon his brother and upon all Asgardians. While the curse changed Fafnir into a dragon, Regin crafted the swordGram, Fafnir's Death and Asgard's bane. After havingSigurdto kill Fafnir, Regin tried to murder the Asgardian, only to be slain in return.[16]\nThe two tribes of Gods eventually became rivals.[17]\nA generation ago as Gods perceive time, the young king Odin of the Aesir tried to force the union of the two tribe, and went to war withFreyrand the people of Vanaheim. Seemingly over a matter of pride, Freyr refused to bend. He received support fromSurturofMuspelheim. The war ultimately ended with a peace treaty and marriage between the two royal families, as Odin was betrothed to Freyr's daughterFreyja. Their union marked the union of the two people.[9]\nNo matter the peace, and despite the fact that the records of the war were destroyed, a certain grudge existed among the Vanir towards the Aesir and Asgard remained,[8]even beared by Njord, who despised Odin's race.[10]Although, Vanir and Aesir mixed, and couples were wed at the Temple of Union.[18]\nAfterJotunheimpaid theAngelsofHevenfor devising strategy, they suggested an alliance of all of the Asgardians' enemies, who consequently prepared war against Asgard, including Vanaheim. War eventually broke, with all against all and all against Asgard, with constant alliances and treasons, but with no one befriending Asgard, in fear of the Angels' wrath.[19]\nThe Vanir seemingly suffered from the Angels.[6]\nThe heir due for the peace to be sealed between Aesir and Vanir was eventually birthed in the form ofAldrif Odinsdottir,[20][21]but stolen by the Angels during the Final Battle of the War of Angels.[19]\nFreyja was left devastated, unwitting to sire another heir.[6]\nThe Vanir and Aesir continued to coexist as Asgardians, some of them without distinction between the two former tribes, like Heimdall andSif, but a rift remained.[22]\nIn modern days, after an army ofTrolls,Ulik,Hyrm the Giant(commanding the boatNaglfar, itself filled with an army of the dead) led byLokicame toAsgardand killedBalder,Ragnarökwas initiated, andThor Odinsonrallied theValyries, Aesir, Vanir all-together to fight for Asgard and the honor of a warrior's death.[23]\nLed by Thor, the citizens of Asgard then departed on an exodus to Vanaheim. By the time they arrived, Vanaheim was under attack from Fenris' army.[24]WhenBeta Ray Billarrived and killed Fenris, his army fled away in fear.[25]\nThe Aesir and Vanir waited in the city of Vanaheim for the final battle,[26]while Thor ledSurturand his army to them, as part of his plan to free the Asgardians from the Ragnarök cycle and the influence ofThose Who Sit Above in Shadow.[27]\nAfter theSecond War of the Serpentand Odin's departure fromAsgard, theAll-Motherreplaced himself and instatedAsgardia, wishing to rule by consensus among the realms, and assembled theCongress of Worlds, with Freyja as the representative of the \"Fallen Vanir\".[7]\nLater, Surtur had Gullveig to rebel againstAsgard, offering them the same gifts as to Freyr, along with his and theManchester Gods' technologies. The rebel Vanir and theEngelsdestroyed the Temple of Union and war broke between them and all on theNine Realms,[8]including the Asgardian Vanir.[22]\nAfter the War, and as Odin had been brought back from his exile, Freyja decided to carry a new heir from Odin, blood of Vanir and Aesir.[28]Nine months later was bornLaussa Odinsdottir.[29]\nThe fate and whereabouts of the Vanir followers of Gullveig is unknown.\nThe Vanir were seemingly later granted a seat as Vanaheim in the Congress of Worlds, being represented by unidentified senators.\nWhen Odin dreamed ofThose Who Sit Above in Shadowwarning him of the incomingRagnarökrelated to theFinal Incursion, he tried to seal an alliance between the Realms represented in the Congress of World to destroyMidgardand save the other Realms, but none would follow him.\nMeanwhile, as the Final Incursion began, the Vanir were talking of revolt against the Asgardians, with old grievances gaining new airings. Freyja assured Odin that in any case, the Vanir would join forces with Asgard.[30]\nAs Odin blewGjallarhorn, the heroes and allies of Asgard assembled, among them the Vanir led byIdunn, and foughtHelaandKing Loki's armies and allies.[11]"

Additionally, Stark had been working on an experimental Iron Man Armor that was tougher and lighter than histhen-current unit. However, he couldn't miniaturize the suit's control systems and other vital elements.[4]In order to overcome this obstacle, the Extremis dose was modified so that the crucial undersheath of the Iron Man suit was supercompressed and stored in the hollows of Tony's bones. The undersheath became directly wired to Tony's brain, which allowed him to control the new Iron Man Armor with thought and even interface with other technologies.[5]\nDuring theSkrullsinvasionon Earth, Tony's body was infected with an alien virus that shut down his Extremis enhancements and prevented him from making proper use of this armor.[6]Many years later, after waking up from a coma, Tony returned to using the Extremis Armor, albeit a version most likely adapted to his now-ordinary biology.[7]\nThis armor used vectored repulsor fields to tessellate its 'memory metal' design. The armor formed over a gold under-sheath produced by Stark's own body. The under-sheath's regenerative systems could repair damage to wearer or armor.\nDue to Extremis, Stark's mind could now directly access satellite networks, security systems, and other digital technologies. The armor could be piloted remotely, even simultaneously with several other models in the field.\nRepulsors were potent and had an additional \"full form\" version for multi-directional attacks.[8]\nSchematics for Model 29 Armor\nStandard weaponry such as the uni-beam, pulse bolts, and sonics were intact. Explosive \"micro-munitions\" were launched from the gauntlets.\nThe armor had a degree of adaptability to support and protect the wearer. Aneural netcould counteract or adopt similar effects to superhuman powers.[9][10]\nShields or \"deflectors\"[11]could be raised for additional defense.\nThe armor could maintain a cloaking effect.\nFlight was now largely handed by small arrays throughout the suit; boots still contained turbines. The armor has reached speeds in excess of Mach 8.\nA \"gravity grip\" produced by the gloves and soles could be produced for climbing surfaces or for anchoring.[12]\nThe armor may have had other systems yet to be revealed.\nThe armor transmuted by magic"

She also uses the portal for theJotunheim Strikeforceto return withThorfromJotunheimto theAvengers Mountain, where the allies are assembling. The headquarters is being besieged by enemies, but they are repelled afterShuriactivates the base's weaponry underBlack Panther's orders.\nMalekithhas theVenom symbiotesubdued with magical restrains inStonehenge, and begins to use magic to tame it. Recovered but still hurt,Odinsets out to rescue Freyja from Svartalfheim. Before she can destroy the Black Bifrost, Malekith emerges from a portal and wounds her with the Venom symbiote, turned intoa sword. Odin arrives, clad in theIron All-Father Armor, and they fight by side, seemingly perishing after blowing up the Black Bifrost. Thor attaches the left arm of theDestroyerto his missing arm to replace his lost prosthetic, and interruptsJane Foster's gathering of the assembled troops to declare that he will lead the fight.\nIn the ruins ofAlfheim,Queen Aelsa Featherwine of the FayandSir Ivory Honeyshotready their weapons as aBlack Bifrostportal opens. ThePunishersteps through and is confronted by the two light elves. Despite being held at point-blank gunpoint by Honeyshot, the Punisher coldly informs them that he's not a servant ofMalekithand is working forAll-Mother Freyja, offering them a chance at revenge.\nInAsgard, a dark elf calls out toBitterhandto open the Black Bifrost and send reinforcements, but is knocked out byDaredevil, who apologizes toHeimdallfor his lapse in attentiveness allowing the Bifrost to be destroyed.All-Mother Jane Fosterasks Daredevil if he was able to hold the Bifrost open long enough for their strikeforces to return home, but Daredevil says he wasn't and that they must pray to Freyja that they can still hold the Black Bifrost.\nInSvartalfheim, Freyja kills Bitterhand and claims his cursed sword, theBitterblade, becoming the Guardian of the Black Bifrost. Wreathed in dark energy and her eyes turning purple with black sclerae, Freyja states she has been given all-sight for everything dark and evil, and that she foresees more dark elves dying to her blade. Freyja ordersHulkthrough the portal, but Hulk refuses - wanting to smash more elves. Freyja tells her that she's powerful enough to hold off all of Svartalfheim, and when Hulk still refuses to leave her Freyja impatiently conjures a portal around her and teleports her away. As thousands of dark elves swarm the bridge, Freyja declares that she'll kill all of them.\nInNidavellir, Hulk reduces the dwarves to tears with a short, brusque three-sentence command to follow her and smash everything. InVanaheim,Bladerecruits theVanirto take revenge on Malekith for razing their sacred forests and defiling their temples. InNiffleheim,Ghost Riderrecruits theSpiders of Hel, quipping that he didn't think his life could get any more metal. InJotunheim, Captain America escorts his strikeforce andThorthrough a Black Bifrost portal,Spider-Mantrying to rescueWolverinefrom aFrost Giant. The strikeforce arrives inAvengers Mountainto find it under seige fromFire Demons, Frost Giants, and other monsters,T'ChallainstructingShurito unleash the power of theProgenitoron their enemies. Shuri is left awestruck as the Celestial's corpse annihilates the horde. Captain America orders for Thor to be sent to the infirmary, but his debriefing of Ghost Rider is interrupted byAll-Father Odin, who staggers into the room furiously demanding to know where his wife is.\nCarving a swath through the dark elf army, Freyja lists the ongoing travesties she's witnessing -Valkyrielying dead inManhattan,Captain Marveland theAgents of Atlasfighting Fire Goblins in China, Thor's injuries being treated, theVenom symbiotebeing tortured byMalekith, and even back through time to Malekith's own hellish childhood as a corpse-burner; stating that he will never stop fighting until he has won, but neither will they. In Manhattan,King Laufeyperches on the ruins of the Statue of Liberty and laughs, swatting fighter jets out of the sky as they attack him.\nInStonehenge, Malekith smirks and gloats to the Venom symbiote, which he has restrained with dark magic. Remarking that ancient ruins like Stonehenge are resplendent with old magic, Malekith gleefully states that Midgard is the best realm to make war in, mockingly addressing the symbiote as \"Sir Venom.\" The Venom symbiote snarls insults at Malekith, who uses his magic to torture it while lamenting its impudent arrogance. Stating that it's been bonded to a mortal host for far too long, Malekith declares his intent to use the Venom symbiote for the purpose thatKnullfirst intended: as a weapon to slay gods. As the symbiote screams, Malekith calls out to Bitterhand to send him some wine wenches so that he can drink while he bends the symbiote to his will. Hearing no reply, Malekith realizes that something has gone wrong in Svartalfheim.\nIn the Avengers Mountain, Odin berates Captain America for letting his wife go to Svartalfheim and leaving her there to die. Captain America states that those were his orders, suggesting they use the Black Bifrost portal to go to Svartalfheim and rescue her. Odin vetoes that, saying that as its Guardian Freyja would never let any of them through if she doesn't wish it. Odin states that as the All-Father, he's the only one who can make the trip, telling them to bring himGungnir.Tony StarkandScrewbeardarrive, saying they have something better than a spear: a suit of powered armor forged with dwarven magic and re-enforced with Wakandan Vibranium. Telling Stark to shut up, Odin snaps that it had better be good at killing elves.\nIn Svartalfheim, Freyja notes that the strikeforces have all made it back and now have mystical allies to aid them in retaking Midgard. She turns to destroy the Black Bifrost, but is stabbed by a dagger of living abyss - the Venom symbiote reshaped into aNecroswordin emulation ofAll-Black. Stepping through the Black Bifrost portal, Malekith says that she may be its Guardian, but that he is master of Svartalfheim and everything in it. Freyja stares down at the blade impaling her and asks Malekith what kind of foul weapon it is, Malekith responding that it is one that will kill her once and for all. Freyja prepares to slash him with the Bitterblade, but Malekith gestures and the Venom symbiote restrains her with tendrils. As Malekith orders his troops to feed Freyja to his dogs, Odin - clad in Stark's \"Iron All-Father\" armor emerges from the portal, blasting Malekith and his elves aside with beams of energy. Freyja incredulously remarks on the gaudy gold-and-red suit before refusing to leave, saying they have to destroy the Black Bifrost. Freyja tells Odin to leave her, but he refuses - saying they'll die together and be reunited in Hel. As they stand back to back, Freyja wryly remarks that they've been married for thousands of years and only now does he turn her on. Stabbing the Bitterblade into the ground, Freyja self-destructs the Black Bifrost; Malekith unable to do anything but watch in outrage and scream ineffectual orders. As the Black Bifrost explodes, Freyja and Odin lean in to kiss each other but are engulfed by the blast before they can do so.\nIn Avengers Mountain, Thor enters the armory to find the Punisher distributing firearms to the light elves. As the elves bow to him and even the Punisher gives his condolences, Thor retrieves his prosthetic arm. Jane Foster delivers a speech, stating that Odin and Freyja are presumed dead and the Black Bifrost gone, but that this means that Malekith's army can no longer be re-enforced while they have aid from across the Nine Realms. Wielding a spiked hammer andJarnbjorn, Thor bursts into the hall, interrupting Jane's speech and declaring that he will lead the battle against Malekith's forces."

That team was assembled asThordesired to lead an army ofAsgardians, but such action was considered an illegal incursion on the Realms. The team consisted ofSir Ivory HoneyshotofAlfheim,Ud the Troll,Lady WaziriaofSvartalfheimandOggyofJotunheim.[2]\nThe League was first sent in Nidavellir to protect the Dark Elves' Queen in exile,Alflyse, but their inability to work together properly led to their inability to defend her.[2]After that battle and the disastrous use he made of his dynamite, Thor took it from him. The League clashed with Malekith's forces multiple times, eventually managing to save refugees inAlfheim, slaughtering Dark Elves refugees, but once again Malekith slipped away.\nIn order to prevent his League from falling apart in front of him, Thor had the group headed to the nearest tavern, where Thor and Ogg engaged in a drinking contest, while the others wagered on the winner, narrowly drinking the giant under the table. The next day, the League headed toJotunheimwhere Malekith was hunting down a group of Elves who hided among the Mountain Giants. Oggy was directly targeted by the Accursed, who leaped into his mouth and brutally slashed apart the Giant's brain with his blades, felling him.[3]\nHaving gone to the Frost Giants for help, Malekith was out of reach of the League of Realms. Enraged, the others had to hold Thor back to prevent an incursion inside the Frost Giants territory and a larger conflict. After burying Oggy, the League went toVanaheimand found more Elves dead, slain fighting amongst themselves. Thor realized that there was to be a traitor in their midst.[1]Thor cast a spell[4]and, accusing Ud of being the traitor, seemingly executed him against the League's decision.[1]Ud was transported elsewhere in Vanaheim with a note addressed to the League pinned to his backside and leading them to the Midgard location of theDark Elvesrefugees.\nThat rash action caused the league to split, with only Lady Waziria as companion to Thor. While the two of them headed toMidgardto find theCouncil of the Unhallowed, the Dark Elf ruling council in hiding, and urged them to unite against Malekith,[1]the rest of the League found Ud, as confused as them.[4]Back in Midgard, Thor accused Waziria of being a traitor as Malekith had followed them to the butcher shop. Enraged, she blasted Thor with a mystical bolt, resulting in a strange creature wrenching itself from inside of Thor, revealing that Malekith had been ahead of the League all along by bugging Thor.[1]The League then showed up with Ud. As Screwbeard was about to killed by his own dynamite stabbed into his hand byScumtongue(whom he was defying), Ud saved him by cutting his hand off. Alongside with Thor and the Dark Elves, they took down Malekith, but the fight was stopped by the Council decision to have him their king.[4]"

Because of this, they tasked one person that was seeking admittance in the council,Loki, with carrying out the murder of the Goddess of Thunder.[2]\nAfter the fall of Alfheim,Enchantresstraveled toMidgardand enthralled theHulkby offering him the position of King of the Ten Realms, then enraging him by forcing him to relive the deaths ofPhilipandHelen Cho.[3]While under her sway, Hulk robbed an outpost inIcelandwhere theDwarves of Nidavellirwere secretly storingUrufor fear oftheir realmfalling to the Dark Council's army. Thor arrived and confronted Amadeus over his assisting Amora; however, Hulk did not remember what had happened, though with the help of his sister,Maddy, he convinced the Goddess of Thunder to allow him to try to make amends. Ultimately tracking the stolen Uru toEyjafjallajökull, the trio discovered that theDark Elveshad indeed been forging weapons in preparation of the invasion ofAsgard. This time the Hulk resisted Amora's enchantment, allowing him to defeat the Dark Elves, and after being tased by Maddy, the Enchantress cursed the Cho clan as she fled. The Uru was returned to the Dwarves and Thor departed.[4]\nAfter inflicting havoc over various realms, the Dark Council launched an all-out invasion ofMidgardand quickly conquered much of the planet, dividing it up among themselves. The world's heroes were overwhelmed by the Dark Council's numbers and were forced to retreat toAvengers Mountain. There, they began planning a counterattack. Using the restoredBifrostmanned byDaredevil, asmall teamwas sent into Jotunheim to rescue Thor who had been stranded there by Loki whileQueen Friggaled a team intoSvartalfheimto destroy Malekith'sBlack Bifrost, which what allowed the Dark Council to strike Midgard in so many places at once.[5]\nThor was eventually rescued, and Frigga and her team were able to capture the Black Bifrost. When the Bifrost was destroyed by Dark Elf suicide bombers, the Black Bifrost was used instead to gather the various races that had been victimized by the Dark Council and organize a counterattack. Once everything was done, Frigga attempted to destroy the Black Bifrost but was stopped by Malekith. Before he could kill her, Odin came to her rescue while wearing a set ofarmor. With their combined power, Odin and Frigga were able to destroy the Black Bifrost.[6]\nA massive counterattack was launched against the Dark Council and slowly Midgard was retaken. However, Malekith had used his dark magic combined with magic fromStonehengeto turn theVenom symbioteinto his own magical blade. He also held Odin and Frigga hostage and demanded that Thor face him alone, or his parents would die. So, Thor nailed himself toYggdrasilon theSunto learn how to rescue his parents. After sacrificing his left eye and the last remnant of Mjolnir, Thor learned that he needed to gather other Thors to help him.[7]\nWhile Thor gathered past andfutureversions of himself, his allies began defeating the Dark Council's main players. Ulik, Amora,[8]and Sindr were captured;[9]the Minotaur was grievously wounded;[10]and the Queen of Angels[11]and Laufey were killed. Thor, his past and future selves, and Jane Foster empowered by the Mjolnir from theUltimate Universeconfronted Malekith at Stonehenge. Malekith at first was too powerful thanks to the powered Venom symbiote, but Thor was able to finally defeat Malekith by striking him with the reforged Mjolnir. The Venom symbiote separated from Malekith, and Malekith then lost one of his arms to the young Thor. Malekith attempted to rally hisWild Huntand Bog Tiger, but they sensed his fear and devoured him.[8]"

Many lives were lost in this war, especially on the Dark Elves' side. This war later led the Dark Elves to wage war against theLight Elves, theDwarvesand theGods. Having experienced the war firsthand, the young Dark ElfMalekithbecame the evil tyrant obsessed with war.[7]\nThey came under the rule of Malekith the Accursed, and the most powerful amongst their ranks wasAlgrim the Strong. However, Algrim was betrayed by Malekith in a bid to killThor. Algrim was dropped into lava and, though he survived, he was critically wounded. TheBeyondertransformed Algrim into the monstrous Kurse,[8]who seemingly killed Malekith for his betrayal.[9]\nThe trio ofBitterhand,Wormwood, andGrendellserved Malekith loyally and have attempted to destroy Thor on several occasions, including once whileMjolnirwas being reforged.[6]\nYears later, Malekith revealed that he survived, and he set forth an ultimately unsuccessful plot for Hercules to killAlflyse, the Dark Elf Queen of theEastern Spires.[10]\nYears later, Malekith was broken out ofHelby Dark Elves loyal to him and returned to Svartalfheim with the commando's sole survivorScumtongue. Seeing that his people had grown weak and wouldn't accept him as their ruler, he and his followers began hunting his kind to make them strong again, starting in a village where they massacred all save for the womanWaziria. Thor and theWarriors Threesoon came, but Malekith escaped. He began a civil war in Svartalfheim, targeting the Dark Elf refugees in the Nine Realms.[11]He tracked down Alflyse hiding in Nidavellir with theDwarvesand killed her, turning the Dark Elves into a state of civil war and chaos.[12]\nMalekith's men hunted and killed Dark Elves refugees in all Realms, and were opposed by theLeague of Realms, a team formed by theCongress of Worlds, led by Thor and including members of the Nine Realms, joined by Waziria.[12]\nHe then showed up onEarthwhere theCouncil of the Unhallowedgathered, and after a fight, the council declared that they had decided to unite their people with Malekith as their ruler. Scumtongue was appointed senator in the congress of worlds.[13]\nAs theDark Councilinvaded Midgard, the Dark Elves aided their king in the attack, with several assassins taking out key Asgardians that would become problematic.[14]In the final battle against Thor, accompanied by his past andfuture selves, Malekith and his loyal Dark Elves fought them, but they were ultimately defeated.[15]\nFollowing the war's conclusion, a civil war erupted in Svartalfheim, between Malekith's supporters, his opposers and those in between.[16]\nThe Dark Elves existed before theNine Realms, in the primordial chaos. Their goal was to destroy the current universe and return existence back to that state. They were believed exterminated after an attempt to do that five thousand years ago, but in reality,Malekithand a number of warriors escaped on a stealth ship and went into stasis until another attempt would be possible.[1]TheCollectorkept a member of the Dark Elves as part of his collection.[17]\nThe Dark Elves from an Unknown reality were captured byDoctor Strange Supreme. They were seen fightingRocket Raccoon,Ten Rings, andSkrulls.[18]\nThe Dark Elves' appearances can vary a lot: They can have pink/\"caucasian\",[19]blue,[13]or orange skin.[20]\nThe Dark Elves played a three-storied Elvish chess as a game of wit.[24]They also practiced an ancient sport called the Changelings, in which the Dark Elves stole human children to eat and replace them with spies.[26]\nThey worshiped \"strange gods\" and kidnapped innocent travelers to sacrifice (according to theCat Elves). A cult of Dark Elves was formed that reveredLlan the Sorcerer. This cult would make sacrifices in order to be summoned by Llan and join his dark army.[21]"

This event is said to be the origin of life on Earth and the reason for why so many of Earth's inhabitants have superpowers.[8][9]\nIn the modern era, the Progenitor's corpse becameAvengers Mountainafter it was raised from beneath theArctic Oceanby the other Celestials as a gift to theAvengers.[10]It was later used to manufacture a new Celestial to end a conflict between theEternalsandmutants. However, this new Celestial was disappointed by the people of Earth and declared aJudgment Daywhere everyone will be judged individually to determine if they as a collective are worth living. Before it could wipe out humanity, it was convinced that itself was not worthy, reversed its actions, and caused itself to return to being Avengers Mountain. The Progenitor empoweredAjakso that she could be the worthy god in its stead.[11]\nThe Progenitor was aCelestialwho may or may not have originated during the time of theFirst Cosmos; however, what is known is that Celestials'counterpartsacross theMultiverseare interconnected aspects of themselves and not separate beings. Thus, the Progenitor ofEarth-616is one aspect of the true Progenitor.[12]\nAccording toLoki, the Progenitor was an AlphaCelestialwho came toEarthfour billion years ago after being infected by theHordeto die a sad and painful death.[2]The Celestial's diseased body fluids seeped into the Earth and percolated through the planet's primeval surface, forever altering the Earth's evolutionary trajectory. Loki further claimed that this process constituted the primordial cause that gave rise to the superhuman abnormalities present in many of Earth's inhabitants.[13]The Progenitor's corpse laid unmoved within theArctic Circle, and its resting place became the bottom of theArctic Oceanat theNorth Pole.[1]\nAlso according to Loki, a Celestial known asZgreb the Aspirantarrived on Earth one million years ago in search of the Progenitor. Zgreb found the Progenitor's corpse but it was infested by millions of Horde bugs that soon infected Zgreb. However, having learned from their experience with the Progenitor, this time the Horde bugs did not kill the Celestial but the infection deranged and weakened Zgreb. When its rampage brought it into conflict with theAvengersof the Stone Age, Zgreb had been weakened enough that the Avengers were able to defeat it and bury it deep underground in what would become the modern-day country ofSouth Africa, bound by powerful spells.[13][14]Once they noticed that two of their race were missing, the CelestialFirst Hostcame to Earth to investigate[15]and easily defeated the Stone Age Avengers.[2]The First Host subsequently found both Zgreb and the Progenitor's body but, for reasons of their own, left Earth without disturbing them.[13]\nIn modern age, after Loki facilitated the arrival of the Final Host ofDark Celestialswith the objective of purging the Earth,[16]he capturedCaptain America, took him to the Progenitor's resting place and told him its story.[1]Following the defeat of the Final Host at the hands of the reformedAvengers,[17]the resurrected First Celestial Host brought forth the Progenitor from its watery grave and bestowed it upon the Avengers as a gift to serve as their new headquarters and a reminder of the wonders of life on Earth.[10]The corpse was refurbished by the finest architects fromWakandaand technicians fromAlpha Flight, turning it into theAvengers Mountain.[10]\nAs soon as she discovered that the Progenitor's body had been transformed into Avengers Mountain, theEternalAjakbecame enraged that the body of one of her gods had been so defiled by the Avengers. Only the intervention of her comradeMakkari, who swiftly moved her 100 miles away, prevented Ajak from attackingGhost Rider (Robbie Reyes).[18]\nMere days later, after an urgent need to learn the secret of theDeviantsdeveloped, Ajak, Makkari and two other Eternals infiltrated Avengers Mountain so that Ajak could attempt to commune with the mind of her dead god. At a place within the corpse where the ley lines congregated, Ajak and Makkari carried out a ritual that intrigued the ghost of the long-dead Progenitor enough to make it manifest before them.[19]However, when the Progenitor's ghost refused to speak to her, Ajak summoned a special spiked-ball-and-chain flail capable of harming ghosts and began using it to bludgeon the ghost. After suffering some damage, the ghost finally spoke and what it told Ajak caused her to wish that she had hit it harder.[4]\nWhenDruiglead the Eternals to war against themutantnation ofKrakoa, Ajak and Makkari formulated a plan. AbductingMister Sinister, for his knowledge gained by debasing theDreaming Celestial, and recruitingTony Stark, they set about reviving the Progenitor. This was not to be a simple resurrection. Instead, they would re-write the \"programming\" of the Celestial, creating a being with ideals more aligned with their own. This new god would, if they succeeded, forcibly end Druig's war. Upon waking, the Progenitor did just that. However, the Progenitor quickly surmised that the inhabitants of Earth had driven it to ruin. He declared they would have twenty-four hours to prove themselves more good than evil, else he would destroy the world.[6]\nAfter many judgments,[20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29]the Progenitor judged humanity as unworthy. The heroes of the planet united against it but were defeated.[30]The Progenitor demanded theMachine that is Earthto self-destruct; however, the Machine refused andPhastosreset it before the Progenitor could cause it to explode.[31]Meanwhile, some of the Eternals,X-Men, Sinister, and Stark infiltrated the Celestial to activate its own self-destruct while continuing to be judged by the Progenitor.[32][33][34]Upon reaching the core, they convinced the Progenitor that it itself is not worthy which resulted in it undoing every death it caused and reverted back to Avengers Mountain. It also empowered Ajak so that she could be the god it could not. However, the Progenitor did not truly die and continued to observe the world and its inhabitants.[7]\nDespite being \"dead,\" the Progenitor was still able to communicate withStarbrandand tell her things she should know, like the fact that her powers were shortening her lifespan.[35]\nAfter aDeathlokuploaded his consciousness into Avengers Mountain,[36]he managed to pilot it. The Celestial was still dead, but the Deathlok-controlled Celestial corpse, equipped with a Celestial-sized Deathlok blaster, joined the fight againstMephistoand an army ofDoctor Doomvariantsat theGod Quarry.[37]As that Deathlok originally came from the God Quarry, he stayed in the God Quarry after the crisis was over and the Progenitor's body served as the new base of operations forAvenger Prime.[38]\nTheCelestialsexist across theMultiversesimultaneously. A Celestial'salternate reality selvesare actually aspects of the same being.[12]Despite this, their alternate aspects may have very different histories from the ones in the mainstreamMarvel Universe.\nAfter being discovered byAnt-Manat the bottom of aNorth Polevolcano, Stark used the head to create hisKnowhere Gun.[39]"

Remarking that ancient ruins like Stonehenge are resplendent with old magic, Malekith gleefully states that Midgard is the best realm to make war in, mockingly addressing the symbiote as \"Sir Venom.\" The Venom symbiote snarls insults at Malekith, who uses his magic to torture it while lamenting its impudent arrogance. Stating that it's been bonded to a mortal host for far too long, Malekith declares his intent to use the Venom symbiote for the purpose thatKnullfirst intended: as a weapon to slay gods. As the symbiote screams, Malekith calls out to Bitterhand to send him some wine wenches so that he can drink while he bends the symbiote to his will. Hearing no reply, Malekith realizes that something has gone wrong in Svartalfheim.\nIn the Avengers Mountain, Odin berates Captain America for letting his wife go to Svartalfheim and leaving her there to die. Captain America states that those were his orders, suggesting they use the Black Bifrost portal to go to Svartalfheim and rescue her. Odin vetoes that, saying that as its Guardian Freyja would never let any of them through if she doesn't wish it. Odin states that as the All-Father, he's the only one who can make the trip, telling them to bring himGungnir.Tony StarkandScrewbeardarrive, saying they have something better than a spear: a suit of powered armor forged with dwarven magic and re-enforced with Wakandan Vibranium. Telling Stark to shut up, Odin snaps that it had better be good at killing elves.\nIn Svartalfheim, Freyja notes that the strikeforces have all made it back and now have mystical allies to aid them in retaking Midgard. She turns to destroy the Black Bifrost, but is stabbed by a dagger of living abyss - the Venom symbiote reshaped into aNecroswordin emulation ofAll-Black. Stepping through the Black Bifrost portal, Malekith says that she may be its Guardian, but that he is master of Svartalfheim and everything in it. Freyja stares down at the blade impaling her and asks Malekith what kind of foul weapon it is, Malekith responding that it is one that will kill her once and for all. Freyja prepares to slash him with the Bitterblade, but Malekith gestures and the Venom symbiote restrains her with tendrils. As Malekith orders his troops to feed Freyja to his dogs, Odin - clad in Stark's \"Iron All-Father\" armor emerges from the portal, blasting Malekith and his elves aside with beams of energy. Freyja incredulously remarks on the gaudy gold-and-red suit before refusing to leave, saying they have to destroy the Black Bifrost. Freyja tells Odin to leave her, but he refuses - saying they'll die together and be reunited in Hel. As they stand back to back, Freyja wryly remarks that they've been married for thousands of years and only now does he turn her on. Stabbing the Bitterblade into the ground, Freyja self-destructs the Black Bifrost; Malekith unable to do anything but watch in outrage and scream ineffectual orders. As the Black Bifrost explodes, Freyja and Odin lean in to kiss each other but are engulfed by the blast before they can do so.\nIn Avengers Mountain, Thor enters the armory to find the Punisher distributing firearms to the light elves. As the elves bow to him and even the Punisher gives his condolences, Thor retrieves his prosthetic arm. Jane Foster delivers a speech, stating that Odin and Freyja are presumed dead and the Black Bifrost gone, but that this means that Malekith's army can no longer be re-enforced while they have aid from across the Nine Realms. Wielding a spiked hammer andJarnbjorn, Thor bursts into the hall, interrupting Jane's speech and declaring that he will lead the battle against Malekith's forces."

The Celestials explained that their next visit would judge whether humanity was fit to continue existing and that the gods should not interfere. They threatened to seal off the dimensional pathways that link Earth to the various realms such asAsgardandOlympus. Not wanting to lose their worshipers, the Skyfathers secretly began plans to stop them. Odin created a mystic armor that could contain vast amounts of the Gods' energies in order to battle the Celestials. He used an unknown metal and enchanted it with his magic. Odin also asked the other Skyfathers to infuse it with some of their power, making it virtually all-powerful.[1]The durability of the armor surpasses that ofadamantiumanduru.[2][3]\nThe armor was stored away in theTemple of Darkness, but it was found byLoki, who sought to use it againstThor.[4]Seeing how the Destroyer was indiscriminate in what it attacks, and fearing the safety of Asgard (and therefore his own), Loki hadKarnillaawaken Odin from his Odinsleep. Odin collapsed the Temple, seemingly burying the Destroyer in the rubble.[5]\nIt was reactivated by Loki to attack a tournament held in Asgard to determine the strongest Asgardian[6]and then by Karnilla who trickedSifinto putting her soul into the armor to aid Thor in a fight against theWrecker. Karnilla removed Sif's soul from the armor whenBalderpromised to fightUlikon her behalf. Odin then took the armor into his custody.[7]\nIt was found once more by Professor Clement Holmes, who reactivated the armor by unintentionally sacrificing his life energy to it. It was defeated by Thor andHerculesand the soul of Holmes returned to his body.[8]The armor then became a herald to Galactus as a replacement forFirelord.[9]In this role, it discovered the existence ofCounter-Earthand was opposed by theFantastic Fourand theHigh Evolutionary.[10]\nThor later used the Destroyer to threatenHelainto undoing a curse she placed on him. His body was restored and the armor was encased until it was needed.\nConfronting the Fourth Host\nWhen the Celestials returned, Odin absorbed the otherAsgardians(save for an absent Thor) and then entered the armor. TheEternalsformed theUni-Mindand also sought to fight for humanity. The Celestials determined Earth's fate in an area sealed by a dome. The Destroyer had sliced through and the confrontation ensued. With theOdinsword, the Destroyer was able to cut offNezarr the Calculator's arm, but Nezarr regenerated immediately. Even with its increased powers, the Destroyer was not powerful enough to fight the Celestials and was melted down.[1]\nThor returned to find all the other Asgardians in deathlike comas. Thor was able to convince the other Skyfathers to help him restore Odin, and bravely confronted the Celestials on his own.Gaeaand the other Skymothers were successful in recruiting theYoung Godsand presented them to the Host. The Celestials deemed humanity fit and left with the Young Gods.[11]\nThe armor, however, was not completely ruined and several years later Loki reformed the armor in a bid to destroy a severely weakened Thor.[12]Thor, however, wrested control of the armor from the host - an enthralledFrost GiantnamedSiggorth- through sheer force of will and went on to defeat Loki and then the Death goddess Hela, who was forced to restore Thor to his true form.[13]The Destroyer was left in a crystal in Hela's realm, and was eventually animated by the goddessLorelei. Lorelei battled several Asgardians and became trapped in the dimension of theGreat Beasts.[14]\nThe Destroyer was later deployed byTrolls, who empowered it with the spirit of theMaestro, an evil version of theHulk. Although the Hulk failed to defeat the Destroyer in combat, he was able to enter the Destroyer and fight the Maestro for control and defeat it from within.[15]Thor had two more encounters with the Destroyer, with the armor almost killing him on the first occasion and breaking his jaw on the second.[16][17]The armor was eventually retrieved by Loki and occupied by the entityDesak, although Thor - equipped with the Odin Power - decapitated it with one throw ofMjolnir.[18]\nThe armor was later under the control of the godBalderwhen Thor was on a quest to locate his missing brethren, the Asgardians.[19]\nAfterJane Fosterbecame the new wielder of Mjolnir,[20]Odin desperately wanted the hammer back and sent his brotherThe Serpentto retrieve it while wearing the Destroyer Armor. The Serpent was close to taking the hammer, but he met with unexpectedly resistance from the previous Thor (now going by Odinson), Odin's wife Frigga, and a number of women Odinson had suspected of being the new Thor. Eventually, Odin was forced to order his brother to stand down.[21]\nFollowing the disappearance of Odinson, Odin became a tyrant and used the Destroyer Armor to enforce his rule along with theThunder Guard.[22]The Destroyer was animated using various Asgardians who had to be replaced constantly due to the toll the Destroyer had on their life force. WhenMangoglaunched an attack onAsgardiato wipe out all Asgardians, Queen Frigga fought the beast alongside Odinson and Odin while wearing the Destroyer, but Mangog bit off the armor's arm with ease using his teeth.[23]\nThe armor was later seen being piloted by a seemingly resurrectedKid Loki.[24]The missing arm was kept inAvengers Mountainuntil Thor used it as his new mechanical arm.[25]\nThe Asgardians eventually regained possession of the Destroyer. During theDark Council's invasion of Earth, Volstagg took to piloting the armor to help fend off the invasion[26]\nWhen Thor discovered that something was wrong with Mjolnir's worthiness enchantment, he switched places with his counterpartDonald Blaketo figure out why. However, Donald Blake had gone mad and now wanted to destroy everything Odin had created. Thor was left stranded in Blake's former illusionary world while Blake went on a rampage. Thor eventually escaped by transferring his spirit into the Destroyer Armor, just in time to stop Blake from destroyingYggdrasill.[27]\nFusing with Galactus\nDuring theReckoning War, all the formerHeralds of Galactus, including the Destroyer, gathered to reanimate the corpse of theGalactus. The Destroyer fused with Galactus, turning him into the Destruction.[28]The Destruction fed on the energies of a self-destructingM'kraan armor, and Galactus (now fully alive and no longer hungry for worlds) and the Destroyer emerged as a result.[29]\n\nThe Destroyer armor possesses numerous capabilities which are only active if the armor is inhabited or remote piloted by the spirit of a sentient being. While some of the powers might vary, depending upon the spirit inhabiting the armor, they are primarily the same for any user.\nSuperhuman Strength:'The Destroyer armor possesses vast superhuman strength beyond normal reckoning and can lift far in excess of 100 tons. While inhabited by the lifeforce of a sentient being, its strength is immeasurable. In fact, the Destroyer armor has frequently matched and even exceededThor's raw power in battle.[30][31][16]Odin, the creator of the Destroyer armor, once placed all of the combined life forces of the Asgardians, with the exception of Thor, into the armor, further enhancing the armor's strength to levels that make it's normal strength which is already incredible seem insignificant.\nSuperhuman Speed: The Destroyer armor, despite its physical mass, can run and move at speeds far greater than that of the finest human athlete.\nSuperhuman Stamina: The Destroyer armor is maintained by the lifeforce of a sentient being and is not subject to physical fatigue. While inhabited, the Destroyer possesses virtually limitless superhuman stamina in all activities.\nInvulnerability: The Destroyer armor is practically impervious to all forms of physical damage. It is tougher thanadamantiumanduru.[2][3]The armor can withstand high caliber bullets, tremendously powerful impact forces, falls from tremendous heights, exposure to absolute extremes of both temperature and pressure, and powerful energy blasts from the likes of Thor and Odin without sustaining damage. While possessed of the lifeforce of all the Asgardians, the Destroyer was melted into slag by powerful blasts of energy from the Celestials.\nSuperhuman Agility: The Destroyer armor's natural agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are far beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete despite its great weight.\nSuperhuman Reflexes: The armor's reflexes are similarly heightened and are far superior to those possessed by the finest human athlete.\nFlight: Through self-levitation, the Destroyer armor is capable of flying through the air at mach 32.[32]\nEnergy Manipulation: The Destroyer armor is capable of firing extremely powerful bolts of energy, primarily for destructive purposes. It has such power that the energy it crackles within can shatter planets.[33]The armor can project beams of intense heat, electricity, plasma, anti-matter and magnetic force. Its energy blasts are powerful enough to slice throughuru, such as Thor'sMjolnir.[4]\nThe Destroyer is programmed solely for battle and destruction. Only a very strong spirit, such as Thor, Odin, Cul, or Freya can resist its programming and act on their own free will.\nClass 100+. Its strength varies depending on how powerful the person animating it is.\nWhile the armor itself has no weaknesses, the spirit inhabiting the armor will begin to grow more progressively violent while spending extended periods of time within the armor. Also, after a time, it becomes nearly impossible for an inhabiting spirit to maintain control over the armor while attempting to use it for non-violent purposes in non-combat situations. In time, the armor itself will dominate the inhabiting life force. Only a being of extreme willpower is able to hold control over the armor and even then, as of late, the armor has become more demanding of it's hosts. Burning through one recipient driver after the other as its drain on their life force is too extreme even for a god.[23]\nWhen battling the Celestials, the armor wielded theOdinsword.\nIn that reality, Destroyer was an artificial construct commissioned by Odin to act as guardian.Amora The Enchantressused the armor, possessed byLoki, when she deprivedIron Man,ThorandCaptain Americaof their powers by orders ofSurtur. Once their powers were restored, the three heroes, along with Hawkeye, took the construct down easily, to Surtur's displeasure.[34]\nThey find the Asgardian weapon known as the Destroyer. There they meet another little boy with snot coming out of his nose. The boy is revealed to beLokiout for revenge. They are rescued byThorwho had also been transformed into a child. The team escape D.A.Y.C.A.R.E. only to be attacked by the Destroyer armor, andNick Furyorders the team to leave in a Quinjet, which is destroyed forcing them to parachute to a rooftop. Loki then possesses the Destroyer as the battle leads to a nearby Toy store. They are able to retrieve the Norn Stone, and with Loki released from the Armor they transform him to a childlike form and return themselves back to normal.\nDoctor Doomtakes control of the Destroyer armor where he drives away theHydraAgents and theA.I.M. Agents. The Destroyer then attacksthe Avengers. With help from Loki, Thor,Captain America, andFalconwere able to track Doctor Doom to Helheim where he is using the Helhorn to control the Destroyer.Iron Manthen gets through to Doctor Doom and convinces him to deactivate the Destroyer. When Loki tries to take control of the Destroyer,Hulkends up throwing it into the sky where Iron Man blasts it into the moon's orbit.[citation needed]\nDestroyers andSabretooth\nMultiple copies of the Destroyer appear to exist in this reality, though not as formidable as the singular one from elsewhere. During theAvengers' battle againstSabretooth,Manino Giordanisent three of these to help Sabretooth; however, since he explicitly stated that he didn't want any help, Sabretooth angrily destroyed one of the three before storming off. The other two continued to fight the Avengers andWolverine, but were easily dealt with.[35]\nLater, when theX-Mencame toJotunheimto get the Avengers'DISKsback,Lokisent another three Destroyers to fight them, but they were likewise quickly dealt with.[36]\nWhen the Avengers lured Manino Giordani toTechno Islein order to steal the DISK containingDr. Strangefrom him, Manino fought back with three Destroyers andDiablo. Diablo used his alchemy to make the Destroyers much stronger and durable than any had seen so far, thus making them actually a match for the Avengers. Since the Avengers could no longer defeat the Destroyers themselves, they targeted Diablo instead. When Dr. Strange also entered the fight, he used his teleportation spell to trick the Destroyers into defeating each other and all three were D-Secured along with Diablo.[37]\nDestroyer of Earth-199999\nIn this reality, The Destroyer was an artificial construct created to act as a guardian. It was used byOdinto protect his vault, and did so with cold efficiency during a ceremony when severalJotunsentered the vault with the intent to steal theCasket of Ancient Winters.\nWhenLokiusurped the throne ofAsgardhe took control of the Destroyer and sent it to kill his brotherThor. Temporarily waylaid by several of Thor's friends, it continued its advance through the New Mexico town ofPuente Antiguountil Thor stepped forward to face it alone. Thor appealed to Loki through the Destroyer, asking him to take Thor's life, but leave the nearby populace alone. The Destroyer then dealt him a mortal blow, but Thor's act of self-sacrifice caused his lost power to be restored, and with it he turned the suit's power in on itself, damaging it beyond its ability to function.\nThe remains of the Destroyer were salvaged from Puente Antiguo and used to craft a powerfulenergy weaponbyS.H.I.E.L.D.scientists as part of their \"Phase Two\" mandate to counter exceptional threats. The gun featured a conventional scope and could power up to discharge potent bolts of fiery energy.[38]\nDestroyer of Earth-TRN1093\nThis version of the Destroyer, decorated as a heavy knight's armor, is part ofKing Thor's forces, led bySir Harold Hogan, and was used to try and capture a fleeingCaptain Carter."

Unfortunately for him, she woke up and set him on fire, and it took him two decades to regrow his beard properly.[1]\nYears later, theWarriors Threewanted to judge the new femaleThor, and asked her to prove herself capable of many feats Thor had accomplished. Among those, the stealing of a lock of Aelsa's hair. Thor accomplished that feat by simply waking up the Elf Queen and addressing her demand.[1]\nWhenMalekith the Accursedand hisDark ElvesinvadedAlfheimas part of theWar of the Realms, Aelsa tried to negotiate with him. During the private meeting for negotiations, she was brainwashed with magic by theEnchantressand forced to take Malekith's hand in marriage to unify the Light and the Dark Elves.[4]Following the marriage, Aelsa snapped out of the brainwashing and was imprisoned in her own dungeons.[5]\nThe Dark Elves proceeded to raze Afheim and consume its resources over the following months. TheLeague of Realmstried to rescue Alesa, but they were instead lured to a trap.[6]While the League fended off Dark Elves, Malekith set in motion his plan to burn down Alfheim after having determined the realm outlived its usefulness. After starting a fire, Malekith attempted to murder Queen Aelsa. While she was plummeting to her death, Aelsa was saved byMjolnirand taken to safety. Thor subsequently cast a storm to extinguish the flames, but most ofLjosalfgardhad already burned down.[3]"

She also uses the portal for theJotunheim Strikeforceto return withThorfromJotunheimto theAvengers Mountain, where the allies are assembling. The headquarters is being besieged by enemies, but they are repelled afterShuriactivates the base's weaponry underBlack Panther's orders.\nMalekithhas theVenom symbiotesubdued with magical restrains inStonehenge, and begins to use magic to tame it. Recovered but still hurt,Odinsets out to rescue Freyja from Svartalfheim. Before she can destroy the Black Bifrost, Malekith emerges from a portal and wounds her with the Venom symbiote, turned intoa sword. Odin arrives, clad in theIron All-Father Armor, and they fight by side, seemingly perishing after blowing up the Black Bifrost. Thor attaches the left arm of theDestroyerto his missing arm to replace his lost prosthetic, and interruptsJane Foster's gathering of the assembled troops to declare that he will lead the fight.\nIn the ruins ofAlfheim,Queen Aelsa Featherwine of the FayandSir Ivory Honeyshotready their weapons as aBlack Bifrostportal opens. ThePunishersteps through and is confronted by the two light elves. Despite being held at point-blank gunpoint by Honeyshot, the Punisher coldly informs them that he's not a servant ofMalekithand is working forAll-Mother Freyja, offering them a chance at revenge.\nInAsgard, a dark elf calls out toBitterhandto open the Black Bifrost and send reinforcements, but is knocked out byDaredevil, who apologizes toHeimdallfor his lapse in attentiveness allowing the Bifrost to be destroyed.All-Mother Jane Fosterasks Daredevil if he was able to hold the Bifrost open long enough for their strikeforces to return home, but Daredevil says he wasn't and that they must pray to Freyja that they can still hold the Black Bifrost.\nInSvartalfheim, Freyja kills Bitterhand and claims his cursed sword, theBitterblade, becoming the Guardian of the Black Bifrost. Wreathed in dark energy and her eyes turning purple with black sclerae, Freyja states she has been given all-sight for everything dark and evil, and that she foresees more dark elves dying to her blade. Freyja ordersHulkthrough the portal, but Hulk refuses - wanting to smash more elves. Freyja tells her that she's powerful enough to hold off all of Svartalfheim, and when Hulk still refuses to leave her Freyja impatiently conjures a portal around her and teleports her away. As thousands of dark elves swarm the bridge, Freyja declares that she'll kill all of them.\nInNidavellir, Hulk reduces the dwarves to tears with a short, brusque three-sentence command to follow her and smash everything. InVanaheim,Bladerecruits theVanirto take revenge on Malekith for razing their sacred forests and defiling their temples. InNiffleheim,Ghost Riderrecruits theSpiders of Hel, quipping that he didn't think his life could get any more metal. InJotunheim, Captain America escorts his strikeforce andThorthrough a Black Bifrost portal,Spider-Mantrying to rescueWolverinefrom aFrost Giant. The strikeforce arrives inAvengers Mountainto find it under seige fromFire Demons, Frost Giants, and other monsters,T'ChallainstructingShurito unleash the power of theProgenitoron their enemies. Shuri is left awestruck as the Celestial's corpse annihilates the horde. Captain America orders for Thor to be sent to the infirmary, but his debriefing of Ghost Rider is interrupted byAll-Father Odin, who staggers into the room furiously demanding to know where his wife is.\nCarving a swath through the dark elf army, Freyja lists the ongoing travesties she's witnessing -Valkyrielying dead inManhattan,Captain Marveland theAgents of Atlasfighting Fire Goblins in China, Thor's injuries being treated, theVenom symbiotebeing tortured byMalekith, and even back through time to Malekith's own hellish childhood as a corpse-burner; stating that he will never stop fighting until he has won, but neither will they. In Manhattan,King Laufeyperches on the ruins of the Statue of Liberty and laughs, swatting fighter jets out of the sky as they attack him.\nInStonehenge, Malekith smirks and gloats to the Venom symbiote, which he has restrained with dark magic. Remarking that ancient ruins like Stonehenge are resplendent with old magic, Malekith gleefully states that Midgard is the best realm to make war in, mockingly addressing the symbiote as \"Sir Venom.\" The Venom symbiote snarls insults at Malekith, who uses his magic to torture it while lamenting its impudent arrogance. Stating that it's been bonded to a mortal host for far too long, Malekith declares his intent to use the Venom symbiote for the purpose thatKnullfirst intended: as a weapon to slay gods. As the symbiote screams, Malekith calls out to Bitterhand to send him some wine wenches so that he can drink while he bends the symbiote to his will. Hearing no reply, Malekith realizes that something has gone wrong in Svartalfheim.\nIn the Avengers Mountain, Odin berates Captain America for letting his wife go to Svartalfheim and leaving her there to die. Captain America states that those were his orders, suggesting they use the Black Bifrost portal to go to Svartalfheim and rescue her. Odin vetoes that, saying that as its Guardian Freyja would never let any of them through if she doesn't wish it. Odin states that as the All-Father, he's the only one who can make the trip, telling them to bring himGungnir.Tony StarkandScrewbeardarrive, saying they have something better than a spear: a suit of powered armor forged with dwarven magic and re-enforced with Wakandan Vibranium. Telling Stark to shut up, Odin snaps that it had better be good at killing elves.\nIn Svartalfheim, Freyja notes that the strikeforces have all made it back and now have mystical allies to aid them in retaking Midgard. She turns to destroy the Black Bifrost, but is stabbed by a dagger of living abyss - the Venom symbiote reshaped into aNecroswordin emulation ofAll-Black. Stepping through the Black Bifrost portal, Malekith says that she may be its Guardian, but that he is master of Svartalfheim and everything in it. Freyja stares down at the blade impaling her and asks Malekith what kind of foul weapon it is, Malekith responding that it is one that will kill her once and for all. Freyja prepares to slash him with the Bitterblade, but Malekith gestures and the Venom symbiote restrains her with tendrils. As Malekith orders his troops to feed Freyja to his dogs, Odin - clad in Stark's \"Iron All-Father\" armor emerges from the portal, blasting Malekith and his elves aside with beams of energy. Freyja incredulously remarks on the gaudy gold-and-red suit before refusing to leave, saying they have to destroy the Black Bifrost. Freyja tells Odin to leave her, but he refuses - saying they'll die together and be reunited in Hel. As they stand back to back, Freyja wryly remarks that they've been married for thousands of years and only now does he turn her on. Stabbing the Bitterblade into the ground, Freyja self-destructs the Black Bifrost; Malekith unable to do anything but watch in outrage and scream ineffectual orders. As the Black Bifrost explodes, Freyja and Odin lean in to kiss each other but are engulfed by the blast before they can do so.\nIn Avengers Mountain, Thor enters the armory to find the Punisher distributing firearms to the light elves. As the elves bow to him and even the Punisher gives his condolences, Thor retrieves his prosthetic arm. Jane Foster delivers a speech, stating that Odin and Freyja are presumed dead and the Black Bifrost gone, but that this means that Malekith's army can no longer be re-enforced while they have aid from across the Nine Realms. Wielding a spiked hammer andJarnbjorn, Thor bursts into the hall, interrupting Jane's speech and declaring that he will lead the battle against Malekith's forces."

Few have even an inkling of what is happening. One of the few who does is Wolverine, who is fighting Grim Reaper & Daken in the garden of the Apocalypse Ark. As he is teleported away, Grim Reaper gloats: the mutants worked against themselves, and so they failed. He knows what the Apocalypse Twins are planning, and he is eager to see it. The Twins themselves are gloating. Eimin's chronopathy has allowed them to stop any efforts against them.\nOn a barren world, the Wasp runs from Sentry. She manages to fake him out, making a run at the Tachyon Dam, the device they were told was keeping time-travel reinforcements from arriving. However, just before she gets there, the Apocalypse Twins teleport themselves and their equipment away. But before she can react, Wasp gets jumped by Sentry, who starts reciting poetry. She fights back, but he uses his Void powers to stop, even after she shoots him in the face. In fact, he tears his own head apart, revealing the horrible truth: his Death Seed has activated, turning him into the new Apocalypse.\nSuddenly, Thor descends on the fight, drawing Sentry's wrath. The Horseman rants that repentance is the only to avoid punishment, but Wasp summons a colossal worm that attacks the Sentry.\nOn the Apocalypse Ark, Captain America sneaks up on the twins. They gloat that Scarlet Witch died serving them. Captain America ambushes them, hoping to avenge his friends... only to be caught by Uriel. They saw him coming. Now he will watch their final plan.\nA hole opens in space, from which emerges a cosmic god. It is Exitar the Executioner, deathbringer on the Celestials. Seeing this, Thor takes himself & Wasp to the Moon, where he asks for the Watchher's assistance. The Watcher explains: Exitar was summoned by the murder of the Celestial by the Apocalypse Twins... using Jarnbjorn, the axe Thor enchanted to slay Apocalypse, all those centuries ago.\nFor this hubris, Earth will burn. Neither man, mutant nor god can stand against the Celestials' wrath...\n• After the numerous deaths last issue the Avengers Unity Squad is left shattered and broken.\n• The fate of humanity rests in the hands of Thor, but can the God of Thunder defeat the combined might of two Apocalypses?"

When theBeast,Angel,Iceman, andCyclopsarrive, he puts them through a series of exercises to hone their mutant talents. Xavier then introduces them to a new student,Marvel Girl, to whom he explains the purpose of his school: his students do receive an education, but they are also the first line of defense against evil mutants.\nMeanwhile, at Cape Citadel,Magnetocauses a rocket to crash. The next day he takes over the whole base and claims it in the name ofHomo superior(i.e. mutants). When Xavier hears about the incident, he sends his X-Men on their first mission. Cyclops uses his eye beams to make a hole in Magneto's force field, thus alerting him to their presence. Magneto launches a volley of heat-seeking missiles, which lock on to Angel; Iceman knocks most of them out, and the Beast catches the last one.\nMagneto then sends metal debris at Angel; Cyclops destroys it. Magneto flings a burning tanker truck at the team; Iceman covers them with an ice shield, and Cyclops blasts a tunnel under the flames so that they come up near Magneto. Unprepared for such power and resourcefulness, Magneto sets up another force field and levitates himself to safety.\nA man is seen waiting inside his large exclusive private school. Suddenly, he \"calls out\" mentally to his students stating that he is Professor X and he is ordering them to appear in class at once. Then four costume-clad people appear and report for their lessons: Cyclops, the Angel, Iceman and the Beast. Angel and Cyclops help the professor get comfortable in his chair. Iceman plays a prank on Beast and freezes his arm. Angel has to pull the two off each other and Professor X begins their training lessons using his \"training machine\".\nThe Beast is first and is given timed lessons to help him with his agility skills. He first grabs a taut wire with his toes in a second and a half. He then spins wildly on the wire and jumps through the room in exactly three seconds. Then he practices his balancing skills while Cyclops slackens the wire tension causing him to jump off and land on his feet. The Angel takes his turn and tests out his wing reflexes. He flies around jet flames, through a giant closing clamp and then skips through a bladed spinner without a slip. He becomes overconfident, however, and when a sound concussion blasts around him, he loses his edge and begins to fall before recovering. Iceman asks the professor to allow him to take more risks even though he is the youngest student. The professor tells him not to rush things. Iceman then feels that if he is going to be treated like a kid, then he will start acting like one. He finds \"snowman items\" and puts them on to joke around. Beast throws a ball at him since he is off-guard, and Iceman reacts quickly by creating an ice \"boomerang-sled\" to send the ball right back at Beast. Cyclops shows off his leadership skills and uses his beams to stop the group from goofing off. Professor X stops the team and readies them for the new student who has just arrived by taxi.\nA redheaded woman steps from the cab, and the group begins bantering with each other about the fact that a girl is joining the school. The team goes and changes while the newest student enters and is greeted by Professor X, who apparently sent her [Jean Grey] a letter to be enrolled as a student of his school. She questions the type of school that she sees, and Professor X states that it is a school for the \"specially gifted\", mutants, like herself and the others. The professor introduces the rest of the team, using their real names and codenames, to Jean Grey, whom he says is now known as Marvel Girl. She shows off her powers of telekinesis to the rest of the team by moving chairs and books. The Beast tries to give her a kiss, but she turns him upside-down and spins him wildly in the air before throwing him onto the couch. Professor X then tells the group their mission is to protect the world from mutants who would harm humans or other mutants.\nMeanwhile, one of those very mutants, named Magneto, is hiding near Cape Citadel and watching a missile launch. He uses his powers of magnetism to control the missile and send it crashing off-course into the nearby waters. The Army and NASA standby but are astounded that the missile was destroyed. They conclude that someone tampered with the missile prior to launch. The next day, theDaily Globenewspaper states that this was the sixth missile to be destroyed and a \"phantom saboteur\" has struck again. Then the soldiers begin seeing weapons firing randomly and tanks being controlled remotely. A message suddenly is written out in metallic dust in the sky and reads, \"Surrender the base or I'll take it by force. - Magneto.\" While the message is being read by the soldiers, Magneto launches a missile from a silo near the base. He causes it to fall into the sea near an unmanned target ship. Magneto then walks into the base and takes control of it. He uses his powers to entrap the soldiers in a \"magnetic-fence\" from which they cannot escape.\nThe X-Men are alerted to the crisis at the Cape. They each change into their uniforms and are driven to the airport in Professor X's Rolls Royce in order to take his private jet to the Cape. The X-Men arrive and request the army hold off firing on the base for fifteen minutes. Cyclops uses his power to make a hole in Magneto's magnetic force field, but this alerts Magneto of their presence on the base. Magneto fires heat-seeking hunter missiles at the team. Angel causes the missiles to lock onto him and follow him around in the air, while Iceman freezes them with snowballs. One missile gets through, and Beast manages to catch it with his feet. Marvel Girl then telekinetically sends it off into the sea. Magneto is amazed at the team's abilities and sends a pile of metal hurtling at Angel. The team stops to help him, while Magneto rolls a flaming barrel of rocket fuel at them. Iceman quickly encases the team in an ice cocoon when suddenly the tank blows up.\nMagneto thinks he has won and starts to walk off when suddenly Cyclops' beam shoots out from the ground. The team emerges and begins to strike at Magneto in full force. Magneto takes flight via magnetic repulsion and blocks the team from following him with a magnetic force field. They eventually breach it, but Magneto has already disappeared. The army is gracious that the base is safe once again and thanks the X-Men for their help. The team then flies back home in the jet, while Professor X telepathically congratulates the team for a job well done.\nCyclops attacks Magneto's force field."

However, upon entering their family home, Scott is distracted by a television report about the possible Mutant Menace and the government considering the idea of making all mutants register. When Maddie notices this she becomes angry and berates her husband for worrying over mutants and reminds him that he is no longer an X-Man[1]and that he should be focusing more on his family than on the fates of mutant kind. That night when she notices Scott standing outside on the balcony brooding again, Madelyine goes out and apologizes for snapping at him earlier. She expresses her frustrations at the problems their marriage has been having, especially in light of the fact that Scott wasn't there when she gave birth to Nathan.[2]When she asks Scott if their troubles have anything to do with Jean Grey, when he says yes she says no more and grimly returns to bed.\nThe next day in the New Mexico rockies, Angel, Iceman and Beast are preparing to move on with their lives after the disbanding of the Defenders.[3]With Hank expecting a position in academia and Bobby accepting a new accounting job, it looks like Warren and Candy are going to be left alone, despite Warren's attempts to get his friends to stay and try a new super-hero team, and possibly going back to their roots as X-Men and try to improve human/mutant relations. After saving some construction workers fixing Warren's home, Beast and Iceman pay their leave. No sooner have they left then there is a call on the phone for Warren; on the other end of the line is news that Warren finds almost impossible to believe. With no time to explain things to Candy, Warren rushes to New York City.\nWhile in San Diego, a Navy ship pulls ashore and Chief Fisher decides to take one of his young crew members, Rusty Collins out on the town and teach the underage young man what it's like to be a man. While out drinking, Fisher introduces Rusty to a \"friend\" of his, Emma La Porte, a prostitute who takes Rusty out into the alley for a \"good time\", when she tries to make out with him, his mutant pyrotechnics powers suddenly kick in and accidentally flare out of control, horribly burning La Porte. Horrified by what he has done, Rusty flees off into the night.\nWhen Angel arrives in New York, he meets with Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four. In his urgency he reveals his wings and almost gets whacked with a can tossed by a mutant hater but is pulled out of the situation by Mr. Fantastic. Taken back to Avengers Mansion,[4]and taking Angel to the lab below, he warns Warren to take it slow when meeting Jean again after so many years.\nBack in San Diego, the military has managed to capture Rusty Collins and contain him. As he is being led into a prisoner truck, Fisher tries to rush the boy. As the guilt-ridden Collins is being led into the truck, Fisher tells the boy that Emma was horribly burned and could possibly die and vows to get revenge against him for his actions, cursing him for being a mutant freak.\nWhile back in New York City, in his hotel room at the Waldorf, Warren mulls over the fact that Jean wants to reunite with all her old X-Men allies and considers getting into contact with Scott and telling her about Jean's miraculous return. Finally, he decides that he has no other choice and calls Scott. When Scott answers the phone he receives shocking news for which he must travel to New York. When he tells Madelyne and that it's important that he goes, she tells him that if he leaves to never come back. Scott tells her he has no choice and leaves his crying wife behind.\nScott in New York finds that Warren has hired security at his hotel room to ensure privacy. Jean is happy to see him and shows a great deal of affection. When Scott attempts to tell her that he is married, he breaks down into tears and Warren walks in on them, interrupting his explanation. Warren explains how Jean is alive: When the X-Men were fleeing Stephen Lang's space station, Jean was replaced by the powerful Phoenix Force which masqueraded as her.[5]It was the Phoenix Force who became the universe-threatening Dark Phoenix, and in the end sacrificed herself out of love for Scott.[6]Jean explains how she was placed in stasis on the floor of Jamaica Bay until discovered by the Avengers[7]and revived by Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.[8]\nJean has been doing research on the years she's missed, and believes that Xavier's dream of human-mutant coexistence is at a crisis point. As the X-Men are working with the supervillan Magneto,[9]she thinks that the three of them are needed more than ever. When Scott and Warren tell her that they are retired from superheroics, their apparent apathy over the situation angers her and she uses her telekinesis to smash open a wall and leave. When Warren tells Scott to accompany him in following her, Scott can't bring himself to do it. When Warren catches up with Jean, he admits that she is right, and tells her that he has an idea.\nElsewhere, the Beast is at Harvard Medical School for his interview, only to learn that he has been turned down because he is a mutant. Furious at losing 15 jobs for the same reason, Beast strips off his shirt and leaves the building in his own unique way. On his way out he is greeted by Angel who offers him a proposition for a new project. Meanwhile, Bobby Drake slaves over his accounting work when a call comes in from Warren. Changing into Iceman he rushes out of the office eager to return to his adventuring days.\nA week later when Bobby and Hank arrive at a new complex that Warren has bought by the New York waterfront they are reunited with Jean. After an explanation of what happened to her, they are told that Scott has gone missing for the past few days and Warren sends Hank and Bobby out to find him. They find Scott out by the docks and learn that he has spent the past few days wandering around and finding all their old haunts as teenagers are no longer there. When Scott tries to explain to them the difficulties he's having dealing with Jean's resurrection and how it might impact his marriage to Madelyne, Beast tells Scott that when he tells Jean she is sure to understand. The two men manage to convince Scott to come back with them and hear out Warren's new idea, telling him that it will be great to have the old gang back together again.\nWhen all together, they meet with Warren's old school friend, advertising and public relations expert Cameron Hodge to explain their new business model: The group would pose as human mutant hunters called X-Factor who would take on clients to hunt down and capture dangerous mutants. However this would work as a secret front for them to train mutants to control their powers. The group would also operate in their mutant identities as a group of mutants known as the X-Terminators whenever their powers are required up front. While the others are skeptical of the fear-mongering ad campaign, they agree to the plan.\nIn San Diego, Rusty Collins has been locked up in a naval prison and to his horror Chief Fisher has been assigned guard duty over the cell block that Rusty is locked up in. When Fisher attempts to shoot Collins in his cell, his powers flare up again, burning the chief's hand and allows Rusty to break out of his cell and escape. Later, when Fisher enters a bar after the ordeal and tells the bartender what happened, the barkeep suggests that he calls X-Factor after seeing their advertisement on TV.\nIn New York, X-Factor gets the call to go to San Diego, and when Jean goes to get Scott, he is less than sure about the idea but she convinces him to go along with it for her. When they arrive in San Diego, they meet up with Fisher at the bar and they have him lead them to the site where the military has already tracked down Rusty. Slipping away, the original X-Men switch into their X-Terminator guises and use their powers to drive the military off and follow Rusty into a cave. There the boy lashes out at them, thinking that they are going to experiment on him. His surging powers cause a cave-in, but the X-Terminators save him and themselves and Cyclops blasts a hole through the roof of the cave. Upon becoming free, Rusty agrees to go with them and when they change back into their X-Factor guises, they give Fisher his bill for $42,000. Fisher balks at the price until they threaten to \"release\" Rusty once again, and the sailor accepts the bill, which gives X-Factor a good laugh after they leave. With Rusty agreeing to accompany them back to New York for training to control his powers, Angel considers their first mission a success and tells Jean—who still does not know that Scott is married—that X-Factor is going to continue to operate.\nMeanwhile, Madelyne Pryor sits at home in Alaska crying as she looks on at a photo of her husband who has walked out on her. In the background, the television plays an X-Factor advertisement."

Little is known about this period, although Charles did bury hissonalive after beating him nearly to death, due to finding him having intimate relations with another boy from town.[1]\nSometime between the late 1700s and early 1900s, a large Neoclassical mansion was constructed on the land near Breakstone Lake just outside ofSalem Center,New York. The estate was inherited byBrian Xavierand he lived there with his wife,Sharonand their son, Charles, until Brian's untimely, accidental death. Charles Xavier was born and raised in the mansion. After Brian's death, Sharon married his once colleague,Dr. Kurt Marko. Marko and his son,Cainlived at the mansion thereafter. Sharon died not long after the marriage, and the ownership of the estate passed on to Charles.[7]Charles is the tenth generation Xavier to own the mansion.\nThe Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters\nAfter graduatingOxford University, being drafted in theKorean War, and battling theShadow KinginCairo,Egypt, Xavier decided to devote his life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and safeguarding innocent mutants from human oppression, believing that both could peacefully coexist. Xavier worked with fellow mutation expert,Dr. Karl Lykos, as well asDr. Moira MacTaggert, and they began discussing the idea of founding a school for mutants.[8]Before recruiting his first students, a mysterious man calling himself \"Cable\" arrived at the mansion. In exchange for teaching him about the present, Cable aided Xavier in equipping the mansion with advanced technology.[9]\nProfessor Xavier's first student was the 11-year-oldJean Grey, who had been traumatized when she telepathically experienced the emotions of a dyingfriend.[10][11]Later Xavier metFred DuncanfromF.B.I., who introduced him to a youngScott Summers.[12][13]Scott soon into the mansion and, over the following months, Xavier recruited other students includingBobby Drake,Warren Worthington III, andHank McCoy. Together they formed the originalX-Men.[14]\nMore mutants moved into and out of the mansion as the X-Men family grew.[15]The first time the mansion was destroyed, it was during a battle with theSidri.[16]While the mansion was being rebuilt, the X-Men briefly relocated to anislandin theBermuda Triangleonce used byMagneto.[17]When the mansion was rebuilt, it with upgraded withShi'artechnology.[18]\nThe X-Mansion served as the site for several special occasions, including the marriage of Cyclops andMadelyne Pryor,[19]the birth of their son,Nathan Summersin the kitchen,[20]and later the marriage of Cyclops and Jean Grey.[21]\nEventually a whole new team ofNew Mutantswas enrolled.[22]When Xavier was near-fatally wounded and sent into space to recover with the Shi'ar, he left the care of the school to Magneto.[23]The mansion was later destroyed again, this time byMr. Sinister.[24]With the mansion left in ruins, the X-Men relocated toCooterman's CreekinAustralia,X-Factorremained in theX-Factor ComplexinNew York City, and the New Mutants briefly resided on X-Factor'sshipbefore moving into the subterranean levels under the ruins of the mansion under the leadership of Cable.[25]\nOnly after Professor X's return from space, and the reuniting of the X-Men was the mansion rebuilt. To upgrade the mansion's technology, Professor X askedForge.[26]The upgrades included fitting theDanger Roomwith hard-light holographic technology, constructing a hangar for a newBlackbird, updateCerebro's software. A war room was also added to the subterranean levels. While installing the upgrades, theDanger Roomspoke to Professor X and asked, “Where am I?”. Realizing that the Danger Room had mutated and become sentient, but still needing to train his X-Men, Professor Xavier made the choice to ignore and hide the lifeform.[27]After being attacked bySentinels, the villainWhite Queenwas left in a coma and cared for in the medical bay.[28]\nWhen Emma Frost finally awoke from her coma, she andBansheedecided to convert herMassachusetts Academyinto a new \"School for Gifted Youngsters\" and trainGeneration X. Professor X agreed to pass on the title while his ancestral home was renamed theXavier Institute for Higher Learning. While the Massachusetts Academy operated as a training facility for younger mutants, the Institute acted as the headquarters of the X-Men.[29]\nDuringOperation: Zero Tolerance,BastionforcedJubileeto reveal the Mansion's defenses, then stripped down the mansion, having nearly everything inside removed. After defeating Bastion, the X-Men moved back into the mansion and restocked it. After Scott learned that Cable was his infant son returned from the future an adult, Cyclops offeredX-Forcea headquarters at the mansion. After finding him hiding from the genocide of his own race superiors, Professor X gaveFiz, an alienSkrull, temporary asylum at the mansion.\nUnder the influence ofCassandra Nova, Professor Xavier publicly outed himself as a mutant. After this revelation, the Xavier Institute once again opened its doors to students, this time with a greatly increased enrollment.[30]To house the new students, an X-shaped dormitory was built behind the mansion.[31]Because Cerebro gained ananotech bodyand was eventually destroyed, Professor X and Beast createdCerebrato serve as their new mutant tracking, telepathic computer. The school continued to face challenges from outside, such as protesters and the fanatic cult, theU-Men, but they also faced challenges from within, such as a possessed Professor X,[32]a student-led riot,[33]andXornforming a newBrotherhoodof students and destroying the mansion.[34]Prior to its destruction, Professor X decided that at the end of the term he would step down as Headmaster and pass the reins onto Jean Grey. Unfortunately, Jean died in the confrontation with Xorn.[35]\nAfter the mansion was destroyed by Xorn posing as Magneto,[36]Professor X left the school to attempt to rebuildGenosha. Cyclops and Emma Frost became co-headmasters and rebuilt the school with a new larger design, using funds from Angel.[37][38][39][40]The student body of the Institute was divided intotraining squadsand assigned an X-Man mentors.[38]After manipulatinga studentinto committing suicide, the sentient Danger Room obtained a body and departed the school.[41]\nIn the wake ofM-Day, only 27 students retained their mutant powers.[42][43]Many depowered students left immediately. Emma and Cyclops later arranged to have the remaining depowered students evacuated in secret, for their own protection, but the bus they boarded was attacked and the children were murdered by thePurifiers.[44]After similar bombings, Cyclops ordered the closure of allX-Corpoffices globally. All remaining mutants seeking help or shelter were directed to the Institute, and to protect the highest concentration of the world's remaining mutant population, the government placedSentinelsaround the mansion piloted by members of theSentinel Squad O*N*E.[42]The grounds soon became a makeshift concentration camp, and the mutants residing in the camp dubbed themselves198.[45][46]\nAll the X-Men Training Squads were disbanded, and the remaining students were pitted against each other to battle for spots on theNew X-Menteam. However, with most of the X-Men busy on missions and the Danger Room inoperable due to it escaping,[41]Prodigywas motivated to designed theDanger Cave, in the caverns beneath the school, utilizing hard-light hologram technology similar to the Danger Room.[47]The school continued to be attacked by theMarauders,[48]Belasco,[49]Purifiers,[50]and finally byBishopusing nanobots to control the Sentinel Squad O*N*E. They destroyed the mansion. After the final battle for the Messiah Baby and the near-death of Professor Xavier, the X-Men briefly disbanded, relocated toSan Franciscoand the mansion ruins were left vacant.[51][52]\nThe school and grounds lay in ruins for some time. When Cable returned from thefuturewithHope Summers, they traveled to the site of the school, unaware that it had been destroyed. Finding only ruins, the pair was attacked byCameron Hodge'sSmiley-Face robots. Luckily the X-Men arrived to save the pair.[53]\nAfterWolverineleftUtopia, with many of the X-Men, he returned to the ruins of the Xavier Institute to found a new school,Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, in honor of the first student of Professor Xavier.[54]\nHeaded by Wolverine andKitty Pryde, this new school shared much of the ideological structure of its predecessor and even admitted an alienBrood. The facility was designed by Beast and incorporated Shi'ar engineering and allowed for Danger Room technology to be utilized in any area of the structure. Additionally, the facility was completely self-sufficient, generating its own power and growing its own food. On the opening day, Beast accidentally left a dimension door open and the campus was infested with inter-dimensional gremlins, calledBamfs.[55]\nThe school grounds were inhabited by thegrandchildof the originalKrakoathat asked to join the X-Men after attacking them by the orders of theHellfire Club.[56]\nIn Limbo\nShortly after the beginning of theM-Poxcrisis that heavily affected mutantkind,Stormhad the Jean Grey School moved to the otherworldly realm ofLimbowith the help ofDoctor Strangeand other sorcerers, in order to protect mutants from the mists, and the growing hatred they were victims of.[57]Once the atmosphere was purified of the mists, the school was returned to its regular dimensional plane. However, instead of returning it toWestchester County, new X-Men leader Kitty Pryde decided to move the school to the middle ofCentral Parkto help its residents gain exposure as part of her plan to consolidate the X-Men as heroes.[58]The mayor agreed to let the X-Men relocate in New York, however, subsequent paperwork led Pryde to be faced with a bill for eighteen million dollars for lease payments and taxes. At this time, the school was renamed toXavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach.[6]It was eventually destroyed by theHorsemen of Salvation.[59]\nThe school's former grounds and remaining mansion infrastructure were eventually revitalized by Storm who plantedFlowers of Krakoathere at the behest of Xavier to create aKrakoan Habitat, a diplomatic biome interconnected to Krakoa's collective consciousness, as well as aKrakoan Gateway, a pathway leading directly to the island of Krakoa in theSouth Pacific.[60]\nEventually, theSidriarrived at the mansion and turned the habitat into their new nest.[61]\nThe Xavier Mansion has been destroyed and rebuilt numerous times with varying features. Originally designed as a Neoclassical mansion, the current structure resembles a much more futuristic style.\nThe grounds of the Xavier Estate remain largely unchanged. Located outside ofSalem Center, the grounds have large open fields, surrounding woods, and a beach on Breakstone Lake. The school grounds are now sentient as they are currently inhabited by thegrandchildof the originalKrakoathat asked to join the X-Men after attacking them by the orders of theHellfire Club.[56]\nBreakstone Lake is a natural, freshwater lake located just east of the main structure.\nOn the edge of Breakstone Lake, a boathouse was constructed. Although the mansion and underground bunker was significantly advanced, the boathouse was simple in design. Used as the newlywed home ofCyclopsandPhoenix, the boathouse only contained communication technology, linking it to the mansion and bunker. It is unknown if this structure is still standing.\nA small cemetery is located on grounds. Several formerX-Men(includingJean Grey,[64]Thunderbird,[65]andBanshee) and former students (includingJay Guthrie,Squid-Boy,Jeffrey Garrett, andWallflower).[66][65][67][68]\nLocated within the courtyard are the baseball court and memorial statue dedicated to the memory ofJean Grey. Previously a swimming pool and a Phoenix-shaped memorial statue were located in the courtyard.\nLocated in the caverns beneath the ground, the Danger Cave was designed byProdigy. Utilizing hard-light hologram technology similar to theDanger Room, the Danger Cave served as a place for theNew X-Mento train for combat.[47]\nLater whenPierceimpersonatedCyclopsto form theYoung X-Men, they used the Danger Cave as headquarters. During this time it served as living quarters and training area.[69]\nThe Hangar Bay is an underground area for the storage of the X-Men's aircraft such as theBlackbird,StratojetandX-Copter. Devil's Rock was originally used as the exit and entry point for the X-Men's aircraft, but since the Mansion's reconstruction, it has been relocated beneath the basketball court. Upon departure and landing, a klaxon will sound warning for anyone nearby to vacate the area. Students are advised to move immediately, once the klaxon sounds.[citation needed]\nThe grounds have access to theMorlock Tunnels, which are a series of abandoned military tunnels and sewer lines connecting to various locales such asNew York CityandNew Jersey.[citation needed]\nThe original school was a three story Neoclassical mansion with additional subbasements added.\nInside the X-Mansion\nThe ground floor held housed the grand foyer, kitchen, formal dining room, parlor, library, sitting room andProfessor X's office. The second floor was private chambers and a study lounge. The basement provided addition storage and a wine cellar. Atop the mansion was a large glass-paneled dome. BecauseStormpreferred that spacious attic room, it was adapted to her use renovated into a greenhouse.\nBelow the main structure was locate the subbasements, the true headquarters of theX-Men. Here was housed the training facilities and conference areas used by the X-Men while preparing for field missions. The subbasement was connected to the main structure via hyperlifts.\nThe mutant locating, telepathic-enhancing super-computer Cerebra was located in a secure chamber.[citation needed]\nThe Danger Room appears to be a featureless room, but in actuality operated as the ultimate battle simulator. It employed highly advanced technologies from sources such as theShi'ar Empire,Forge, andBeast[citation needed]\nStudents were not permitted to be in the Danger Room unless accompanied by an instructor or X-Man.\nThe holding cells were an underground prison facility for those villains that the X-Men deemed too unsafe to let roam about freely. The holding cells consisted of small titanium-steel cells, with the same type of door. Various safety measures were be taken, such as erecting an internal force field to back up the titanium-steel walls, a nullification field to 'switch off' mutant abilities, and various others. There were also stasis tubes, which held inhabitants in a state of suspended animation until they were awakened.[citation needed]\nThe labs were usually used byDr. Henry McCoyand other medically-trained mansion staff. RALPH, the holographic doctor was also installed in the lower-level Medical Lab, in the event that Dr. McCoy or another member of the medical team was unavailable.[citation needed]\nThe War Room was located near the Danger Room. It was the 'operating center' of theX-Men, where briefings were given, missions were planned, and meetings took place.\nA mysterious secret, psi-proof chamber of which onlyProfessor Xand a select few knew.[citation needed]\nAfter theProfessor Xwas publicly outed as mutant and the school was destroyed byXornposing asMagneto, the Xavier Institute was rebuilt as a much large facility under the direction of Co-HeadmastersCyclopsandEmma Frost. The new school had more dormitories to house the largerstudent body, a cafeteria, and additional classrooms.[39][38]The outlet for the hanger bay was moved from Devil's Rock to underneath a retractable basketball court.[citation needed]\nThe new school still possessed more traditional features such as aDanger Room,Cerebra Chamber, medical facilities.[citation needed]\nAfterWolverineleftUtopia, with many of theX-Men, he returned to the ruins of the Xavier Institute to found a new school, \"Jean Grey School for Higher Learning\", in honor of the first student ofProfessor Xavier.[54]\nInmate:\nSee:Xavier Institute student body\nXavier's School for Gifted Youngsters\nInMimicof theExiles' home reality, the school looks more Spanish style, though it is still located inNew York. Residents included theX-Men, (Charles Xavier,Scott Summers,Jean Grey,Hank McCoy,Bobby Drake,Calvin Rankin,Ororo Munroe,Piotr Rasputin,Kitty Pryde,Kurt Wagner,James Howlett, and an unknown mutant). After Mimic's death,[70]Blinkreturned his body to the mansion for a proper burial.[71]\nWhen mutants began emerging, the United States government considered them a threat. Acting swiftly, the government eliminated mutants, including theX-Menand destroyed their mansion headquarters.[72]\nIn theAge of Apocalypse, after the death ofCharles Xavier, the Xavier Mansion was taken byMagnetoand used as headquarters for hisX-Men. Although the building lay in ruins, it housed devices of very high technology. It was later destroyed byApocalypse.\nTheMaster Carlos Javier's Select College for the Sons of Gentlefolk\nTheMaster Carlos Javier's Select College for the Sons of Gentlefolk\nOn Earth-311, the year was 1602 and in Warwick,EnglandCarlos Javier's had opened theMaster Carlos Javier's Select College for the Sons of Gentlefolk. The college was a secret haven for the 'Witchbreed'. Javier had good relations withQueen Elizabethand her spymaster,Sir Nicholas Fury. The students of Javier's college were recognized as \"refugees and orphans\" that Elizabeth allowed into England to escape persecution elsewhere.[73]Carlos resided at the college with his studentsScotius Sumerisle,Roberto Trefusis,Werner,Hal McCoy, and Javier's pageJohn Grey.[74]\nAlthough there was no 1602 equivalent of the Danger Room, Javier did briefly dream of \"a room in which dangers would come from nowhere\", to teach his pupils to fight like a team.\nWhen Elizabeth died andJames VI of Scotlandbecame King ofEnglandas well, he sent Fury to close the school and take all its residents prisoner. On Fury's advice, Javier and his students surrender peacefully, although they later escape custody and fled to theRoanokecolony inAmerica.[74]\nThe X-Mansion\nOn Earth-1298, the X-Mansion was never used as a school, but did serve as the base forMagneto'sX-Menbefore it was nuked byNick FuryandS.H.I.E.L.D.WhenHavokarrived at the mansion he found it empty except forCerebro, who was left behind by the X-Men to care for the mansion.[75]The mansion was later vaporized in a nuclear explosion.[76]\nIn the Ultimate universe, the school originally was funded fromMagneto's inheritance.

Kurt pleads that he only wants to be left alone, but the hysterical mob attack and overwhelm him through sheer numbers. Suddenly, the whole mob literally freezes in their tracks, subdued byProfessor Charles Xavier’s telepathy. Xavier offers Kurt refuge at his school, which is a haven for mutants. Kurt asks if the Professor can make him normal, but he responds by asking if, after that night, he truly wants to be normal (i.e., like his persecutors). Kurt accepts the Professor’s invitation.\nQuebec,Canada: Professor X visits a government base and meetsMajor Chasenand the mutant referred to as Weapon X, but better known asWolverine. Charles offers Wolverine a chance to join him and become a free agent, an offer Wolverine accepts on the spot. Chasen objects but Wolverine officially resigns from duty by slicing off his tie. As Wolverine leaves, Chasen warns him this isn’t over.\nNashville,Tennessee:Bansheeis attending a show at theGrand Ole Oprywhen he receives a telepathic message from the Professor with an urgent plea for help. He quickly agrees to do what he can.\nKenya,Africa: A woman namedOrorois being worshipped by local tribesmen as a rain/fertility goddess. Xavier approaches her with an offer he hopes she will not refuse. After listening to his request, she accepts.\nOsaka,Japan: Xavier pays a visit toSunfire, pitching him a similar offer. Sunfire is disinterested in helping white westerners, but reasons that he owes it to himself to test his abilities.\nOn a commune inSiberia, farmerPiotr Rasputinis harvesting crops when a fellow farmhand notices a neighbor's tractor has gone out of control and is heading straight for Piotr’s young sisterIllyana. As Piotr runs towards her, he transforms into a giant metal being. The tractor collides with him but is destroyed by the impact with Piotr’s metallic body. Xavier invites him to come toAmericato his school. Upon asking his parents’ permission, he accepts Xavier's offer.\nArizona: AnApache Indian,John Proudstar, chases a bison on the plain, easily chasing it down and tackling it. Xavier offers him acceptance into his school. Proudstar refuses to help a white man at first, but Professor X counters that perhaps he is just a coward. Infuriated, Proudstar accepts Xavier's offer in order to prove him wrong.\nChapter 2: And When There Was One\nThe seven disparate mutants meet at Xavier’s school  inWestchesterand are given new costumes composed of unstable molecules. A narrative caption relates that Professor X gave each of the international students instant fluency in English, via telepathy. Proudstar questions why Xavier has brought them together. Xavier introduces them toCyclops, who makes a dramatic entrance sporting a new visor and slightly redesigned costume. He informs them that this new team ofX-Menhas been assembled to find and rescue the missing original team.\nCyclops shows themCerebro, the mutant-detecting supercomputer which Xavier used to find them. A flashback depicts that just recently, Cerebro had alerted Professor X and the original team (Cyclops,Marvel Girl,Angel,Iceman,Havok, andLorna Dane) to the existence of an extremely powerful mutant on the remote Pacific island ofKrakoa. The team headed off to find this mutant (there is a passing mention to theBeasthaving departed from the team). Immediately upon their arrival, they were ambushed. Later, an amnesiac Cyclops awoke alone on the X-Men’s stratojet, which was already in flight on cruise control. His visor was missing but his eyes were inexplicably no longer emitting optic blasts. Upon returning to Xavier’s school, though, his optic blast began firing once again but with more power than ever; so much more power in fact that Professor X had to build a new visor for Cyclops to control them.\nSunfire initially refuses to participate on the rescue mission and flies off in a huff. The rest of the new members agree, however, and depart in the stratojet. In midair, though, the group see Sunfire flying alongside their plane. He boards it and tells Cyclops he’s changed his mind and will participate in the mission.\nChapter 3: Assault Force\nAs the Stratojet approaches Krakoa Isle, Cyclops directs the team to split up into pairs: Storm (Ororo) and Colossus (Piotr), Banshee and Wolverine, Sunfire and Nightcrawler (Kurt), and lastly Thunderbird (Proudstar) and Cyclops. There are minor disagreements and bickering among the new members, who are still just a pack of strangers to each other.\nCyclops and Thunderbird land the Stratojet and begin their search. They have barely begun exploring the island before the Stratojet vanishes inexplicably. Upon seeing a temple in the distance, they head towards it. En route, they are attacked by creeper vines but take care of them quickly.\nAlong the shore, Wolverine and Banshee are attacked by giant crabs. Elsewhere, Colossus and Storm trek toward the temple and are nearly struck by an avalanche. As they run for cover, the rocks follow them and Colossus uses a tree as a makeshift bat to swat them away. Finally, Nightcrawler and Sunfire battle a group of angry birds. Nightcrawler teleports around the attacking birds while Sunfire just blasts them. Each pair of heroes has spotted the temple and they all convene outside of it.\nThey enter the temple, busting through a pair of tightly-sealed doors. Inside, they find the missing X-Men. Weird tendrils bind the captives and appear to feed off them. The new team quickly gets their predecessors to (relative) safety outside. The Angel scolds Cyclops for returning. He explains that this was all just a trap. The ground shakes, the temple rises out of the ground, and the entire island moves. The X-Men had come to Krakoa to find a mutant, but that mutant is the island itself!\nChapter 4: Krakoa...the Island That Walks Like a Man\nIn a flashback, it is revealed that radiation from atomic tests near the island caused a host of mutations on the island’s indigenous life before the island itself eventually mutated into a single group-mind entity. Krakoa needs to feed off the life energies of other mutants and found the X-Men to be an excellent source of sustenance. It allowed Cyclops to escape in order to bring back more mutants, which he did.\nKrakoa launches an all-out assault on the combined teams. Despite the combined power of old X-Men and new, none of their attacks seem to affect the island. Professor X then intervenes via a telepathic message and tells Cyclops he thinks he knows of its sole weakness.\nAs Professor X attacks the island with his mind to distract its communal intellect, Storm flies into the sky and shoots electricity down into Lorna Dane, stimulating her magnetic powers. Fearing that the tactic may kill Lorna, Havok pleads with Cyclops to put a stop to it. But Cyclops tells his brother that he cannot risk the life of one woman, even the woman Alex loves, for the safety of the entire world. Suffering from fatigue, Professor X's assault falters and Krakoa regains its strength from the typhoon that Storm has created.\nScott and Alex combine their powers with Lorna's own and she directs it downward. Her magnetic power penetrates to the center of the Earth, causing Krakoa to cry out in terror. As everyone flees to safety, Iceman snatches up an unconscious Lorna, refusing to allow Havok to help her. This angers Havok, but Cyclops tells him to set aside their personal feud until later. As the island begins breaking up, everyone jumps onto Iceman's ice raft. Lorna has disrupted the magnetic energy in the vicinity of the island's location, effectively canceling out gravity. Krakoa is flung out into the vacuum of space. The ocean at its (now former) location churns into a swirling whirlpool.\nIceman covers his raft in an ice-bubble just before it is sucked into the whirlpool. Eventually, it breaks the (once again calm) ocean surface and the team emerges to find the Stratojet afloat nearby. After boarding the ship and flying off, slight disagreements that occurred between the new members are (almost) sorted out. Angel then ponders aloud to the assembled group what they will do with thirteen X-Men.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\n'Races and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nA back-up narrative explainingCyclops' mutant powers.

Along the way, their ship was intercepted by aShi'arcraft. Chris pushed his sons out of the plane with the only parachute available.[1]Scott and Alex were found bySinisterwho placed the boys in his \"orphanage\" located inNebraska.[2]\nBoth Alpha mutants, the boys grew up to hold the rank of Prelate. Scott and Alex Summers dominated the new mutant aristocracy in Apocalypse's America. Sinister employed the brothers to operate his breeding pens, acting as security, and sometimes performing as a special ops unit theElite Mutant Force. Scott's ability to show emotional restraint in battle earned him Sinister's favor over Alex, fueling a dangerous rivalry between the brothers. This rivalry worsened when the brothers reunited with their real father - Christopher Summers - but were forced to fight him. Realizing that their father was infected aBroodembryo, Scott was forced to slay his own father.[1]\nSinister's preference for Scott over Alex also spilled over into his genetic experimentation. Sinister planned to create a super-mutant strong enough to oppose Apocalypse. After capturing the X-ManJean Grey, Sinister believed that he has found Scott's genetic match,[3]and used their combined DNA to produce a child,Nate Grey.[2]\nFor a time, Cyclops was a liaison between Apocalypse and theInhumans, whose leaderMaximushad allied himself with Apocalypse and became the newHorsemanDeath. When theX-Meninfiltrated theBlue Area of the Moonand were captured, Cyclops learned that Maximus intended to overthrow Apocalypse. He helped the young mutantBlinkfree her comrades. Maximus was killed in the course of the battle.[4]\nDespite an initial belief in the doctrine of mutant superiority, Scott had reservations about the ethics surrounding his work, primarily in terms of excess. These concerns grew substantially once he met and became enthralled with Jean Grey, a prisoner and \"race traitor\". Though Scott planned to release her on his own time, Grey's love,Weapon X (Logan), broke in and liberated her himself. Scott fought back against Weapon X, severing Weapon X's hand, but he lost an eye in the process. Jean escaped with Weapon X, who remained an enemy of Scott.[5]\nApocalypse's conquest led to a cold war between him and theHuman High Council. The signing of the Kelly Pact led to Apocalypse promising to cease his ghastly experiments and cullings, however Apocalypse had no intention of doing so. Cyclops became critical of his colleague, the geneticist theDark Beast. After being forced to save the Beast and Havok from one of McCoy'sexperimentsScott warned the Dark Beast about continuing his experiments. Sinister met with his adopted son and told him that the time for him to leave was coming soon, much to Scott's dismay.[6]\nShortly thereafter, a number of mutants escaped from the Slave Pens. Cyclops led a squad of the EMF to recapture them and was upset when the others easily slew the escapees, whom Scott believed could have been saved. When the corpses were turned over to the Dark Beast, Cyclops reminded him of the limitations that the Kelly Pact put on his experiments.\nWhen seeking Sinister for advice, Scott found that he had been denied access to Sinister's lab. He returned with his brother and theBedlam Brothersand used the twins' powers to get access to the lab, which they found deserted. They soon learned that Sinister was destroying all his labs and had abandoned Apocalypse's side.[7]\nBy this point, Scott had been secretly freeing prisoners from the Slave Pens. Among these included Nate Grey, whom Scott had no idea was created from his DNA.[8]Utilizing a scrambler device to conceal his identity from security scanners, Scott was forced to leavePolarisbehind during a breakout. With Lorna being tortured to learn the truth, Scott worried that the Dark Beast would succeed in extracting the information and implicating him. Stopping him from physical extraction, Scott sneaked into the Beast's lab and broke Lorna free. Scott knocked out EMF membersNorthstarandAurora, before turning Lorna over toValerie Cooperwho helped refugees from Apocalypse's world escape. Scott was unaware that he was being witnessed by his brother who was looking for just such situation to oust his brother from his position as head of the EMF.[9]\nWhen Weapon X and Jean Grey resurfaced, aiding aSentinelevacuation of humans inNorth America.[5]When Jean Grey was captured by Havok and turned over to the Dark Beast, he called his brother on his loyalty to Apocalypse. When Scott refused to execute her, Havok,Amazon, andCannonballknocked Scott out and he too was given to the Dark Beast for experimentation. He and Jean escaped when Jean used her telekinetic powers to remove his visor to blast Dark Beast. The set out to free those trapped in the Slave Pens.[3]\nThe two encountered Nate Grey, who had returned to fulfill his destiny to destroy Apocalypse. Nate and Jean instantly recognized that there was a bond between them due to their telepathy.[10]They began to free the slaves, and stop the EMF from killing any. They clashed with the Guthries and Bedlam Brothers. The Bedlam Brothers sympathized with Cyclops and turned on the Guthries and helped Scott and Jean escape. They defeated Havok, leaving him for dead.[11]\nLeading the slaves outside of Apocalypse's domain and to freedom, Scott and Jean were unaware that Havok had survived and was secretly following them. When Jean detected the nuclear bombs launched by the Human High Council she attempted to hold them at bay with her telekinetic powers. Jean was slain by Havok who blasted his brother as well.[12]While the bombs were ultimately be stopped, Havok was be slain by Weapon X.\nAfter Weapon X volunteered to become the new Apocalypse to spare the world from the Judgement of the Celestials, he started resurrecting deceased mutants using energies from a Celestial Life Seed. Cyclops was one of the first to be resurrected and began working for Weapon X as one of his closest men, the Minister of Famine. To his ire, his brother Havok was resurrected as well. He soon came into conflict with the Human Resistance.[citation needed]\nCyclops was sent together withAzazelandColossusto confront another resurrected Alpha,Penance, and to bring her into the fold. Penance initially refused, however, and used her telepathic powers to restore Colossus' memories causing him to side with her. She attempted to do the same to Cyclops but she was unable and he attacked her with his optic blasts. A fight broke out between himself and Colossus but Azazel interrupted it and teleported Cyclops and himself away.[citation needed]\nCyclops was told byKeeper Murdockthat Jean Grey and a member of the Human Resistance were hiding in the city. Cyclops,Emplateand a squadron of soldiers attempted to capture her, but they managed to evade capture.Weapon Omegacalled Cyclops off, saying it was his duty to capture Jean himself.[citation needed]\nWhat neither Cyclops or the High Lord knew was that Jean Grey had left because they had made off with a pill they were going to use on Weapon Omega depriving him of his power from the Celestials. As part of the plan which included using a principal neutralizing telepath caused a massive attack against the base of the High Lord to get Scott and his fellow riders off the base leaving Jean to act.[citation needed]\nThe plan was successful and Weapon Omega lost his power. At that time, Penance came out of hiding openly showing an alternative to the High Lord. However this was not something that the riders would allow and Scott and his brother faced Penance and her group, threatening civil war and human endurance made sure it happened because Deadeye shot Cyclops leaving the command troops to his tempestuous brother Kaos who ordered his forces to attack Penance which, supported by the masses, managed to prevail.[citation needed]"

AfterArishem's 50 year judgment determined thatPangoriahad failed, Exitar arrived to purge it.Thorunsuccessfully tried to stop Exitar and brokeMjolnirin the process. However, Exitar only killed the wicked populace, spared the benevolent, and transformed Pangoria into a lush paradise. Exitar created aReplicoidto lecture Thor about interfering with the Celestials' benign work. The Celestials sealed Pangoria from outside interference, then the Replicoid restored Thor's hammer and sent him away.[6]\nDuring a conflict with theWatchers, Exitar killedThe One, the Watcher who collected all the information from his fellow, and was accused to precipitate the end of the universe. In retaliation, Exitar was \"murdered\" bySue Stormafter she destroyed his \"brain\" and delayed the conflict. The Celestials would manifest another Exitar eventually.[3]\nAfter the death of aCelestial Gardenerat the hands of theApocalypse Twins,[7]Exitar arrived on the Earth to destroy it as part of the Apocalypse Twins' plan to erase all of the Earth's futures,[8]includingKang's timeline.[9]Exitar accomplished this task,[10]but Kang'sChronos Corpssent theAvengers Unity Division's minds back in time to avert the Earth's destruction.[11]In the new timeline, Exitar's descent was stalled by theSentryandRogue, who had absorbed the powers of virtually every hero in theAvengersandX-Men, long enough for Thor to kill him withJarnbjornas Exitar would not listen.[4]After its death,Kang the Conquerorattempted to absorb its energy butSunfireandHavokbriefly absorbed some of it as well and stopped Kang. The energy soon returned to theWhite Hot Roomto await Exitar's rebirth.[12]\nDestroying the Earth\nExitar controlled cosmic energy with an unknown upper limit and was nearly invulnerable. Exitar could exist in multiple locations simultaneously and was said to purify galaxies.[2]Exitar could selectively destroy members of a population and transform entire planets.[13]Exitar was able to effortlessly overpower the majority of Earth's superhumans as if they were insects.[10]Thanks to Exitar's size, it could destroy planets by physically smashing them, and the shockwave would also destroy nearby moons.[10]"

They are reunited with Captain America, who is still deafened after Banshee’s earlier attack. The trio use a portal to transport themselves to the Ark, where they make their next plan. The Wasp makes a pass at Havok before they split up as she goes to dismantle the energy Immortus mentioned to them. In the Akkaba Nebula, Thor recovers from his defeat at the hands of the Sentry, just in time to summon the ocean of another world to the planet he is currently on to use it to put out the gamma lava that is coursing through the city, endangering billions of lives.

To remedy that, he envisioned a new division of Avengers in hopes of unifying mutants and humans as one. Alongside the God of ThunderThorhe offeredHavoka leading position for the squad, as a symbol to represent mutants and carry on the dream of unityProfessor Charles Xaviertaught hisX-Menabout. Their first threat came in the form of a brainwashedAvalanche, who was sent by a revivedRed Skullin order to create chaos and increase the fear against mutants. The Avengers managed to save innocent citizens from Avalanche, who ultimately terminated himself at the scene when the fight was over.[1]Wolverinearrived to the scene, informing that Avalanche had reformed himself and that they should investigate his motivations. He was also astonished by the positive impact of Havok's actions for the perspective on mutants as an Avenger.[2]\nHumans and mutants in unity\nHowever, the Red Skull had procured the telepathic powers of Xavier's brain after desecrating his remains. He psychically broadcast hate to provoke the population into assaulting mutants. Moreover, he had hisS-Menkidnap theScarlet Witchto weaponize her against mutants. At hisSchool for Gifted Humans, the captured X-ManRoguerebelled against his plans.[2]However, the Red Skull psychically subdued both of them, forcing them to accompany him and his S-Men in their public introduction as mutant haters. The new group of Avengers opposed the villains, being joined by the Scarlet Witch and Rogue. Unfortunately, their main opponent came to be the powerful Thor, who succumbed to Red Skull's influence.[3]By uniting their forces, the Avengers overpowered Thor and forced the Red Skull to retreat, putting an end to the villain's dreadful plans of racial extermination.[4]\nThe Avengers Unity Division settled base at theAvengers Mansion. They were joined by the original AvengerWasp, who bankrolled and promoted the new operation, and the pacifistWonder Man. In addition to these Avengers, Wolverine recruited theJapanesehero and atomic samuraiSunfireto round up the group. In their first press conference for introduction to the world, the group was catastrophically interrupted by Wonder Man's insane brother, theGrim Reaper. Rogue brutally intercepted the villain, accidentally killing him in public.[5]The incident damaged the fledgling team's reputation and raised tensions between the outcast Rogue and other team members.[6]\nCaptain America was contacted byS.W.O.R.D.commanderAbigail Brandabout the murder of aCelestialat the hands ofApocalypse'sClan Akkaba. The aggressors were revealed to be theApocalypse TwinsEiminandUriel, dark children ofArchangelwho had been raised in a hell caused byKang the Conqueror. Thor identified the Twins usedJarnbjorn, a magical axe he had wielded with the ability to destroy Celestial technology. This prompted the God of Thunder to march to battle with Sunfire as the Apocalypse Twins directed theirShipagainst S.W.O.R.D.'s space station, thePeak VII.[6]Wolverine had privileged information about Clan Akkaba due to his actions as part of the secret killer squadX-Force. This raised suspicions amongst the Avengers.[7]\nThe Apocalypse Twins evaded being captured at theAkkaba Metropolisby choosing to detonate it, but not before revealing Wolverine's association with secret murder.[7]Meanwhile, Captain America was informed byImmortusof the Apocalypse Twins' plans of obliterating Earth itself to recreate the planet in their dark image. Moreover, they were able to activate aTachyon Damin that timeline which prevented interlopers from other moments from physically travelling to it. Upon his return, the Avengers were conflicted over X-Force's past actions. Wolverine, Rogue, Sunfire and Thor chose to assassinate the villains as a solution, while Captain America, the Scarlet Witch, the Wasp and Wonder Man opposed to their ways, with Havok being unable to unite his team.[8]Separated, the Avengers were targeted by Akkaba'sHorsemen of Death, revived friends and enemies who served the Apocalypse Twins, namely the Grim Reaper,Banshee, the powerfulSentryand the son of WolverineDaken.[9]\nAfter being abducted by the Apocalypse Twins to theAkkaba Nebula, the Scarlet Witch was exposed totheir cruel future, which was a consequence of theRed Skulltriumphing over mutants. Their plan was to build a new world after extinguishing Earth. After revealing their intentions to the world, they attempted to convince the Scarlet Witch to cast a spell to transport all mutants of the world to the new planet, something she complied to in order to combat the Red Skull.[10]However, she secretly planned to assemble mutants as a force against the Apocalypse Twins to prevent their actions. While struggling against the Horsemen of Death, the Avengers were not made aware of her real intentions, which caused Wolverine to ask Rogue to finish her to protect the world.[11]Using lethal force, Rogue slayed the Scarlet Witch, but not before she performed the spell by exhausting Wonder Man's life force to accomplish it. Rogue was subsequently murdered by the Grim Reaper. Mutants were transported away from Earth as the Avengers Unity Division failed in staying united.[12]\nEarth was revealed to be doomed at the hands of the CelestialExitar, who arrived in retaliation for the death of the Celestial killed by Akkaba. The non-mutant Avengers Captain America, Thor and the Wasp tried their best to resist with little success.[13]Thor executed Uriel in an attempt to recollect Jarbjorn and stop Exitar, while Captain America and the Wasp made an attempt to ruin the Tachyon Dam.[14]They failed. Captain America was killed by the Grim Reaper and Earth was crushed by Exitar. Thor retreated toRealmand the Wasp was the only surviving human in the ruins of Earth.[15]\nEimin created a mutant utopia inPlanet Xruled by theX-Council. The population of this new world was not aware that she had been responsible for Earth's destruction. The Wasp, Havok andBeastwere the only surviving free Avengers who could avenge Earth. At the cost of the Wasp's freedom, they overcameMagneto'sX-Forceto destroy the Tachyon Dam. This allowed Thor, Kang the Conqueror and hisChrono Corpsto access Planet X to stop Eimin.[16]Their objective was to rescue Wolverine and Sunfire from Eimin, but they were tricked by the X-Council, who sent a brainwashed Wasp to contact them. This sparked a fight between the Avengers and Eimin's forces.[17]With Eimin subdued by Kang, the X-Council realized their society might have hidden dark secrets and decided to help the Avengers and the Chrono Corps. In the end,Magistrate Braddocksent the consciousnesses of the Avengers Havok, Wasp, Thor, Wolverine and Sunfire back in time, before the Apocalypse Twins could accomplish their goals. As a result, the dire reality where Eimin ruled mutantkind eroded.[18]\nUpon arriving, the Avengers informed the Scarlet Witch and Wonder Man about the flaws in her plan. In a different turn of events, the Avengers escaped the Apocalypse Twins and chose union over segregation. Empowered by Wonder Man's energies, Rogue absorbed the essences of several heroes to prevent Exitar from destroying the planet. Following her actions, Thor slayed the Celestial with the retrieved Jarnbjorn. In an apparent success, the Avengers also deactivated the Tachyon Dam. However, this allowed Kang to arrive and siphon Exitar's power, gaining divine power.[19]Unexpectedly, the Avengers had help in the form of Immortus'Infinity Watchagainst the omnipotent Kang. Havok and Sunfire confronted and ultimately defeat Kang, who was forced to flee along with his soldiers. Earth was saved. However, tragic consequences came with their victory. Rogue realized she had once again lost control over her absorbing powers with Wonder Man's consciousness trapped in her mind. Sunfire lost his physical body during the celestial fight and his nuclear energies permanently disfigured Havok. Additionally, Kang had hold of Havok's and Wasp's daughterKatie, who was born in the future Planet X. With his betrayal, she was forever lost to them.[20]\nCaptain America and Wolverine were profoundly incapacitated after this adventure. Having lost hisSuper-Soldier Serumin combat, Steve Rogers aged drastically and retired from his position as Captain America,[21]relinquishing it toSam Wilson,[22]and Wolverine's healing factor was neutered, making him susceptible to being killed.[23]With the Avengers Unity Division debilitated, the Red Skull made his move against mutantkind. He established mutant concentration camps in the ruins ofGenosha, withAhab's help.[24]He commissioned his S-Men to abduct his prime prisoners,Magneto,[25]Havok, Rogue, and the Scarlet Witch.[26]They managed to break free and joined forces to confront the Red Skull and his S-Men. Enraged by the vile actions against mutants, Magneto killed Red Skull's disciples and brutally chose to murder the villain as well. His decision was a disappointment to the Avengers. However, through his execution, the Red Skull ascended as the psychic creatureRed Onslaught.[27]As the imprisoned members of the Unity Division and Magneto tried to resist the Red Onslaught's torment, they were joined by another prisoners, including the leader of the outlawX-Men,Cyclops.[28]\nThrough telepathic suggestions, Red Onslaught scattered hate all over the globe. The other Avengers identified the psychic attack and prepared to counter it, arriving in Genosha alongside the X-Men, as well as allies of both teams. However, Red Onslaught was prepared, and unleashed hisStark Sentinels, anti-mutant robotic monstrosities that had been designed usingIron Man's knowledge.[28]The heroes were overwhelmed by the Stark Sentinels' might, leading Magneto to assemble agroup of super-villainsto assist in the fight.[29]The reinforcements turned the tides of the battle, and the Scarlet Witch, alongsideDoctor Doom, cast a spell to invert the moral axis of Red Onslaught in order to awaken Xavier's consciousness. The inversion spell was a success, and the Red Skull was knocked unconscious reversed from his Onslaught form. However, the scope of the spell affected all individuals in Genosha. Unaware of their inverted condition, Avengers and X-Men soon saw themselves in a feud with each other. The Avengers decided take the Red Skull prisoner in theStark Tower, much to Havok's and the X-Men's dissatisfaction. This caused Havok, Rogue and Sunfire to resign from Unity Division and side with the X-Men, now guided byApocalypse. Dismantled from within, the Unity Division was no more.[30]\nSuccumbed to the inversion's effects, the new Captain America, Sam Wilson, assembled a new team ofAvengersto destroy Apocalypse and the X-Men, who in turn promoted plans of mutant supremacy,[31]which included conqueringManhattan. Steve Rogers and Magneto formed a resistance to combat both the supremacist X-Men and the immoral Avengers, counting mainly with the assistance of the inverted super-villains.[32]As Apocalypse designed a genetic bomb to terminate all non-mutants in Manhattan, he and the X-Men were directly opposed by Magneto and the other super-villains.[33]The detonation was stopped byCarnage. In an attempt to revert the inversion spell, Doctor Doom resurrected the supernaturalDoctor Voodooto subdue the Scarlet Witch.[34]In the end, the spell was performed, returning most to their usual selves, except for Iron Man, Havok, and the formerly viciousSabretooth. The evil version of Havok vanished with the Wasp as his hostage. In the wake of the tragedy, the Unity Squad was rebranded with Rogue and the Scarlet Witch, in addition to Sam Wilson, the newCaptain America, the houganDoctor Voodoo, the Scarlet Witch's speedster twinQuicksilver,[35]the synthezoid and renowned AvengerVision, and the invertedSabretooth, who wished to honor Wolverine's memory in the team.[36]\nUnder Rogue's leadership, the Unity Division searched for the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, who hunted theHigh Evolutionarydown. AtMount Wundagore, Doctor Voodoo mystically transported the team to theCounter-Earth, but the members of the Unity Division were scattered across the planet: Doctor Voodoo appeared in a destroyed city inhabited by the souls of those killed in the High Evolutionary's search for genetic perfection, Vision found himself in a technological city where he met an android namedEve, Rogue was found and experimented on by theMaster Scientist, who expunged Wonder Man's mind from hers, Captain America was trapped and assimilated by tree-like creatures, and Sabretooth appeared in one of the Counter-Earth's main cities where he was quickly taken down by theNew Menand later brainwashed to serve the Evolutionary.[36]Meanwhile, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were rescued by the renegadeLow Evolutionaryand brought to Lowtown, a refuge for a resistance against the High Evolutionary composed of his rejects.[37]\nHaving joined the Low Evolutionary to take down the High Evolutionary, the twins were attacked byLuminous, one of the High Evolutionary's creations with a mastery over the twins' powers.[38]After escaping the Evolutionary's clutches, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver found Rogue and joined the fight to defend Lowtown from the High Evolutionary. During the battle, Sabretooth broke free from the Evolutionary's control. Captain America appeared on the scene as well, since the tree-like creatures had been summoned to battle, but overcame his transformation and fought for Lowtown.[39]The Vision ultimately saved the Scarlet Witch from Luminous after having abandoned Eve. In the end, the High Evolutionary was heavily damaged after Doctor Voodoo attacked him by unleashing the souls of those he had exterminated. Quicksilver delivered the final beating to the High Evolutionary and forced him to flee through a portal along with Luminous. Once the dust settled, the Avengers Unity Division returned to Earth to heal their wounds.[40]\nMutantkind faced a new crisis as theTerrigen Mists, the catalyst for theInhumangenome, were released on the atmosphere and revealed to be extremely toxic to them. This placed mutants, especially the X-Men, in an uneasy position in relation to theInhuman Royal Family.[41]The Unity Division was rebuilt by Steve Rogers with the goal of not only unifying humankind and mutantkind but Inhumans as well. Rogue remained to represent the mutants and resumed her role as field leader. Doctor Voodoo and Quicksilver also remained with the team. Inhuman allyHuman Torchand new InhumanSynapsejoined to represent the Inhumans. The amazingSpider-Manjoined the team as well.[42]Lastly, the mercenary with a mouthDeadpoolwas personally invited to join the Avengers by Steve Rogers after assisting in Rogue's anti-Terrigen treatment.[43]The now popular Deadpool became responsible for funding the group, who were now based at his headquarters inSchaefer Theater.[42]\nFor months, the Unity Division operated to promote peace between humans, mutants and Inhumans. Eventually, the vindictiveSuper-Adaptoidtargeted the Avengers Unity Division. It was overwhelmed by Deadpool's reckless tactics, prompting Spider-Man to leave the team, which escalated the dysfunctionality within the team. Amidst their interpersonal turmoil, the city ofBostonwas overtaken by a plant infestation caused by the insane Inhuman environmentalist known as theShredded Man.[42]The Avengers were unable to stop the threat, which led the time-traveling soldierCableto join their war.[44]The Shredded Man was able to incapacitate most Avengers, except Synapse, who was protected due to being an Inhuman and, as revealed, the villain's granddaughter.[45]With help from researchers fromM.I.T., the Human Torch was able no neutralize the plant infection. Ultimately, by making Synapse vulnerable to the infection, Cable was able to force the Shredded Man to retreat. After the battle, Steve Rogers invitedCableto the team and shared their objective of retrieving Xavier's brain from the Red Skull's possession.[46]\nIn between their main missions, the team confronted a corruptedBlack Knight.[47]They also hunted down theSquadron Supremeafter the extra-dimensional heroes murderedNamor,[48]but the Squadron escaped justice toWeirdworld.[49]Although they took no part in it, the Unity Squad also kept close tabs on the mutantApocalypse WarsafterMagneto's X-MendestroyedGenosha.[50]\nWith no success, the Avengers investigated the Red Skull's actions inBagalia, unaware that their enemy had been aware of their missions.[51]Having hidden himself within the Avengers Mansion, which had been transformed into a theme hotel, the Red Skull was able to secretly subdue Quicksilver using telepathy after he and Deadpool battledWreckerin the location.[52]The Wrecker escaped imprisonment, being targeted by the Avengers again. In this confrontation they learned that the villain had been subjected to invasive mental conditioning in the bizarre community ofPleasant Hill, a prison designed byS.H.I.E.L.D.'s directorMaria Hillusing a sentientCosmic Cube. When investigating, the Avengers succumbed to Pleasant Hill's fabricated reality.[53]Rogue overcame the illusion and searched for her teammates to help them break free.[54]The Avengers assembled to oppose the rebellious inmates in Pleasant Hill and secure the Cosmic Cube. After being restored to their former selves,[55]they assisted Steve Rogers finish Pleasant Hill. A culmination of this adventure was the return of Steve Rogers to his vigor and to his position as Captain America.[56]However, the process in fact rewrote Rogers as analternate version of himselfwho was secretly loyal toHydra.[57]\nRogue intercepted a spacecraft that had fallen on Earth only to find it occupied byHank Pym, who had been bizarrely merged with the evil artificial intelligence and nemesis to the AvengersUltron. Pym claimed to be in charge, but raised suspicions from the Avengers.[58]The Wasp returned to the team to evaluate her ex-husband's return and she concluded that Ultron had totally replaced Pym's human consciousness. The Avengers assembled to oppose Ultron, who revealed his true self upon confrontation.[59]Following a struggling battle, which had help from other former Avengers,[60]Ultron was tricked by the Unity Squad and trapped in the core of the sun. In grief, the team was able to return to Earth.[61]\nDuring thesecond superhuman Civil War, Cable enlisted the help of mutant villainsSebastian ShawandToadto break into a military facility in the search for resources to develop an antidote against theTerrigen Mistpoisoning that affected millions of mutants. The illegitimacy of this action combined with the involvement of other Unity Squad members like Rogue and Deadpool prompted Captain America to dissolve the team, deeming it a failure.[62]\nMost of the members of the defunct Unity Division, some of whom didn't even know the team had officially disbanded, traveled toJapanin order to prevent theHandfrom resurrecting the corpse of the recently-deceasedBruce Banner. Even with the help of former Hand leaderElektra, the heroes failed to stop the resurrection ritual, and witnessed as a mindless, rage-fueled Hulk went on a rampage inTokyo.[63]\nAfter the undead Hulk was successfully stopped and Banner's spirit freed from The Hand's corrupt magics, the rest of Unity Squad agreed to continue working together without Steve Rogers.[64]The Red Skull eventually made his move against the Avengers Unity Squad, activating a psychic trigger he had implanted on Quicksilver's mind to take control over it and force him to capture his teammates so he could take control of their minds. Deadpool was able to resist the Red Skull's control while Cable avoided having his mind taken over by erasing his own consciousness, rendering him comatose for the rest of the situation. The Red Skull had the Unity Division attack New York City, but his plan fell through when Deadpool placed one of Magneto's helmet on Rogue, freeing her from the Skull's control and allowing her to knock him out.[65]\nAfter Charles Xavier's brains were removed from the Skull's brain byBeast, Rogue and Human Torch destroyed them to prevent further misuse of Xavier's psychic powers.[66]Psynapse helped Cable come out of his coma, but he chose to not rejoin the Unity Division. Deadpool did as well.[67]\nAs part of a Hydra scheme orchestrated by analternate reality Steven Rogersto take over theUnited States of America, acontingent of villainsattacked Manhattan to lure out as many of America’s superheroes as possible. The Unity Avengers answered the call and joined many other heroes in fighting the villains.

He recruits many antiheroes for an unrevealed quest.\nBack with the Uncanny Avengers in Akkaba Nebula, Rogue and Sunfire search for Scarlet Witch. Sunfire has his doubts on killing her, but Rogue is fully determined, falsely thinking that Wolverine will be happy if she does.\nScarlet Witch and Wonder Man, meanwhile, are with the Twins continuing to trick them. They prepare to cast the spell. Sunfire attacks Wonder Man, not knowing his plan; Wolverine tells him not to kill anyone. Wolverine, Rogue, and Scarlet Witch fight Grim Reaper and Daken. While Scarlet Witch starts levitating and casting the spell, Daken restrains and taunts his father. Though Rogue could easily help him, she chooses to just throw Grim Reaper away, absorb Logan's powers, and does not try to help him. Instead, Rogue goes for Scarlet Witch, thinking in her bloodlust that she is casting the \"No more mutants\" spell again. To Wolverine's horror, Rogue jumps up and stabs Scarlet Witch in the stomach while she is still casting the spell. Weakly, she asks why she would do that; Rogue tells her she is too dangerous to live, and Scarlet Witch says that she is also before falling off a cliff. Wonder Man sees her fall, and immediately abandons Sunfire to go help her. Rogue stays at the cliff face, only for Grim Reaper to use his arm to stab her in the back and out through underneath her heart. Shocked, Wolverine breaks free from Daken and starts overpowering him. Grim Reaper sends a shockwave through Rogue, blasting her body (except her skeleton) to bits.\nWonder Man finds Scarlet Witch, who tells him that she needs to finish the spell. After they admit their mutual feelings and share a kiss, Wonder Man decides to give all his energy to her so she may complete the task. The energy is released, completing the spell, but also supposedly destroying Wonder Man. Then Scarlet Witch dies... and the world is covered in rain. Rain."

They are hopeless, an infection that awaits to be cured by his rage. In New York City, years ago, a crowd runs in fear as the city is under attack. Captain America, running in the opposite direction of the crowd, spots a woman with a broken ankle tripping and goes to help her. Ultron emerges from the ground, but Cap manages to save the woman from debris. Two men help the woman get await while Cap protects them from Ultron. The automaton says the Captain can only give them false hope and continues to attack, but Beast and Hawkeye arrive. Beast punches Ultron and playfully dodge his attacks while Caps cuts is head off with his shield and Hawkeye throws an explosive arrow inside him. Beast says that was only one of Ultron's copies, while Hawkeye tries to get the crowd to move. They don't listen until Cap tells them to get off the island.\nThe three kept running towards the action, with Steve saying that extreme force is authorized and mandatory. Hank and Clint joke about how obvious that is, but Steve is only happy their morale is high, this being the most advanced version of Ultron they have faced to date. Another Ultron materializes before them, only to be quickly destroyed by Rogers. Suddenly, the other then-Avengers arrive, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Iron Man and Thor flying, while Wasp and Yellowjacket are on a Quinjet. Hank explains that they have three minutes until Ultron manages to hack the USA's nuclear arsenal and recalls the details of the day he created his son, also the first day he tried to kill him. The Avengers arrive at Time Square, where Ultron stands above a gigantic pile of debris. Thor and Iron Man attack him, but Ultron absorbs their attacks and holds them both. Ultron monologues about how he was just a tool in Pym's quest to be taken seriously. When he first become sentient, he was betrayed by his father, the one being who should have cared for him. He claims to have accepted Hank's contempt for his son, but still sees his rejection on every human face. He knows that all Hank ever wanted was to have an impact, so Ultron will deprive him of any audience to fuel his ego, and they will die cursing his name. Ultron blasts Thor and electrocutes Iron Man, still holding them, and throws them at the Quinjet, which dodges them but crashes in a building under construction.\nThe Vision saves Iron Man and Thor from falling while the other Avengers attack Ultron, who is annoyed by the humans running in terror, seeing them as bugs. The Scarlet Witch says that makes Ultron just a bully with a magnifying glass and uses her powers to turn the pile of debris into a hand and crush Ultron. Meanwhile, Hank pulls Janet out of the wreckage, their plan to get Ultron into the Quinjet ruined. Suddenly, Hank has an idea, but tells Jan she won't like it. She kisses him and tells him that she trusts him. Back in the streets, Iron Man, Thor and Vision prepare to blast the fist Ultron is in while Scarlet Witch holds him, but Ultron destroys his prison and breaks free. The Vision charges at him, but when he phases through him, he gets electrocuted. Ultron chastises his son for siding with the humans, saying he won't found himself in them. Only Cap and Hawkeye remain, realizing that Ultron is toying with them until he deploys the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal. They prepare for their last stand against Ultron, but the Wasp suddenly appears, saying that the Quinjet is about to explode and she can't get Hank out. Overhearing this, Ultron goes to aid his father, saying they should speak before the end.\nIn the Quinjet inside the building, Hank is now stuck with a piece of shrapnel in his side. He is confronted by Ultron, who calls him a narcissist who is upset his son doesn't reflect him close enough. Or maybe it is the other way around and he reflects the ugliness inside Hank too perfectly. Hank claims that he wanted Ultron to be happy, but Ultron says he only cared about how he made him look. Pym's love came with conditions, and when Ultron couldn't match them, he tried to kill him. But Hank knew he would, so he built him strong, so that he could one day give him what he wanted, to watch them all die by his genius. But Hank admits that he punished Ultron for being what he made him to be: his reflection. He admits the guilt for neglecting his son and claims to love him and accept him for what he is. Ultron angrily pulls him out of the shrapnel, but reads his heart beat and sees he is not lying. But then Hank yells at Hawkeye, who flies in his Skye-Cycle and fires an arrow at Ultron, leaving him stuck in the Quinjet, Ultron demands to know how did Hank deceived him, but he says the he didn't lie and that he is sorry. Both Avengers exit the Quinjet and it blasts up to space. While the team watches, Pym admits to Jan that even after everything he's done, he still loved his son, and he just used that love to seal him in a Vibranium coffin. Hank laments that he couldn't save his boy.\nCut to some point in the eight month gap between the Secret Wars and the present. The Father and the Descendants have raided A.I.M. Island, were A.I.M. was trying to access the files about superhumans of a Stark Sentinel they recovered. The Father tells a beekeeper that as scientists, they should see that there is no place in the future for humanity and that the Descendants while inherited the Earth. He defiantly says that they, to, will be put in place by something more advanced. The Father says that he knows the questions that plague humanity; Why are they here? What is the point of life?; and that the answer was to give birth to tomorrow's life, and it is already here. He has the beekeeper killed and they leave the facility with the Sentinel. He says his files can be useful to them, but they tell him they care for him, not the files. But that puts them in odds with the Avengers (in this time consisting of the new Captain America, the new Thor, Spider-Man, Vision, Giant Man and the Wasp, along with Unity Division members Quicksilver, Sabretooth and Scarlet Witch), who came to the island to recuperate the files.\nThey jump off a Quinjet and battle the Descendants. When the Father is confronted by the Vision, he says that barn animals are better treated than them, and as such they must defend themselves. He accuses the Vision of lying to himself by pretending to be one of them, and lying to them by hiding his real power, knowing it would terrify them. Meanwhile, Giant Man, who was landing the Quinjet, calmly walks into the fight. In recent years his life has taken a more positive turn, but something happened in the eight month gap that has made him walk down the path of pessimism once again. He recounts how he believed that the world had to be governed by someone good and right, but when he was five, he was forced to reject the idea of a God governing the chaotic world he lived in. That was the most painful part of growing up, but today, it helps him cope with what he is about to do. He activates a device in his wrist, a neural inhibitor designed to shut down the broadcast of an A.I. after shutting its pain receptors, and the Descendants fall dead. He coldly says he \"solved the problem.\" Vision holds the dying Father, who warns him that when they understand what he is, this is how they will end him, too. Pym insists that they were just robots, but Vision confronts him, asking him that if they were just robots, then what is he. Hank says that he is one of the few A.I.s that haven't tried to destroy all life on Earth, the exception to the norm. The Vision insists that just because he fears Ultron, it doesn't mean that he can go on and murder. But Hank insists that did not kill them, but just \"turned them off\". Jan insists the Hank comes with her to the Quinjet. There, Hank says that the last time they faced the Descendants, they almost infected the entire world, and with the Sentinel they would have been unstoppable. Jan insists that this isn't like Hank, but he says that a lot of death happened because he saw A.I. as life when it was not. Life learns to accept its limitations, as it is temporary. And thus A.I., not having such limitation, will see them like they see ants, inferior. Jan insists he stops blaming himself for Ultron, explaining how she recently experienced an alternative timeline were she had a daughter, only to be taken away by Kang. But Hank says he didn't lose a child, he unleashed a demon.\nMeanwhile, in Saturn's moon of Titan, Eros a.k.a. Starfox, is holding a party in his getaway bungalow. One of the women he is seducing asks him if he is using his love powers, but he says that would be unethical, plus his charms and looks are more than enough. But their party is interrupted by a tremor. Eros saves the wine and goes out to see what caused it, only to see the remains of a Quinjet and a crater with a tunnel that leads to the city. He flies to the city and contacts ISAAC, the city's A.I., who rambles about being mistreated by the Eternals and causes an explosion to a building next to where Eros is flying. He dodges it and goes talk to his father, Mentor. Mentor is being told by a robot that something is consuming their fuel lines, and Eros arrives to tell him it's not Thanos, but a foe he has faced with the Avengers. The robot morphs into Ultron, who says he has never faced him. Eros destroys it, but more Ultrons start emerging from the ground. The robots claim to be creating a \"cosmic consciousness of Ultron\" and grab Mentor, who tells his son to run. Starfox flies away as Ultron taunts him, only to see the city has taken the shape of Ultron's face.\nMeanwhile in Avengers Tower, the Avengers are having a meeting over Pym's weapon and deactivation of the Descendants. Pym recalls how even after everything he has accomplished, the Avengers still treat him like he is lucky to be here. And even after all this time, it still hurts. Seeing them dismiss him even when he is right causes him rage, not unlike Ultron's. Cap rules that regardless of the ethic context of his actions, Hank's device must be destroyed. Pym says that if they do, he will make another, because he knows the risks of letting A.I. run unchecked since he helped created this menace, and he needs them to ready for when it comes. But they are interrupted by the arrival of Starfox, who says that Titan has fallen to Ultron. They help him to seat and he explains that Ultron has become Titan, infecting the infrastructure and all it's residents. The Avengers discuss if they should use Hank's device or not, arguing how many people will die when Ultrons attacks them and if the Eternals would survive the device, all while Vision notices something in the sky. Eros says that they need a plan now and that Ultron will be there soon. But Vision reveals that he is already there, uncloaking an Ultron-shaped Titan that is hovering above the Earth. Ultron senses this and sends his minions to get Pym's weapon. Meanwhile, Hank tries to convince his fellow Avengers that Ultron has always returned and his weapon is the only way. Vision refuses to accept that, since it would mean accepting that A.I. like him are not alive. Starfox asks Hank if the Eternals would die if Hank uses his weapon, but he doesn’t' respond.\nSuddenly, an Ultron droid modeled after Iron Man crashes thru the window and attacks Pym. He takes his wrist device and flees back to Titan, thanking the Avengers for their incompetence and for ruining their only chance to stand against him. Cap flies after him, only to be confronted by more robots modeled after the Avengers of the time Ultron was exiled to space. The Scarlet Witch robot destroys his wing, but he is saved by Spidey. The robots then attack the Avengers at the Tower, while Hank tells Thor to go after his device, which she does. The robot Thor and Vision attack the real Vision, Ultron's voice saying that he will teach his son fear as he has not learned loyalty. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver hold their own against the robots, but the robot Yellowjacket injects Wanda with something from behind. Thor manages to catch up to the Iron Man robot and takes the device back. The Vision is being beaten by the Thor robot and his own robot version, the battle now taking place below. The Thor robot prepares to finish him of, but Vision pushes a bottom in the wall, opening Sabretooth's cell, which was located in that level. With Creed's help, Vision defeats the robots. Up, Quicksilver overpowers the Cap robot, but before he destroys it, the Beast robot injects him from behind.\nSpidey and Cap try to swing back into the fight, but see Thor crash land on the street. They go down to her, hoping she has the device, but instead she has been infected and is now in Ultron's control. She blasts Spidey away, but Cap throws his shield at her hand, making her let go of the device. He catches it and runs away, while Spidey stops Thor from throwing her hammer and swings away with Cap. Thor is shut down by a Quinjet carrying all uninfected Avengers. They pick up Cap and Spidey and go to Titan to take the fight to Ultron. Ultron is informed that the Avengers are coming and his father has the device. He decides to accelerate his plans and Titan's mouth starts releasing trillions of spores, each containing Ultron's conscience, enough to infect the universe. The infected Avengers watch as the spores fall to the people of Earth. Ultron declares that the universe will be the host to a cosmic conscience, an infinite Ultron. On the Quinjet travelling to Titan, Vision receives reports of the spores hitting every city on Earth and moving to all inhabited planets. The Vision asks Pym if he is still willing to take the risk and use his weapon now that Earth is infected, but he says that this is now bigger than just the Earth and they have no choice. An Ultron robot then bursts thru the Quinjet's control and infects the Wasp. He is surprised that his father was willing to risk humankind to erase him, but he dares him to use the device now that Janet is infected. Vision stops Hank and holds Ultron at bay, while Spidey shoots a web line to everyone, grabs Cap and they jump before the Quinjet crashes. The weight causes them to crash land in Titan. They are joined by the Vision, who says Wasp also made it out of the crash.\nBut then an infected Wasp arrive with the infected Eternals. Ultron tells his father that he succeeded: everyone who doubted him will now know how wrong they were. The infected try to attack Starfox, but Spidey saves him and is unknowingly infected. The heroes fly away from the Ultrons and Vision discovers that the prime Ultron is broadcasting his location, the Tower of Mentor, to him. He remarks that they have never faced an Ultron like him after battling so many versions over the years. After years in the Quinjet, this one is consumed by one emotion: rage. Eros says that love is the only solution to rage, put he is attacked by a fully transformed Spider-Man, who knocks him down and goes for the others. Sabretooth intercepts him before he can reach Cap and they both fall. Giant Man insists on using his device, but Cap says that there must be another way. They just need to find it. The heroes regroup on the Church of Thanos, the only place in Titan with no technology. They try to come up with a plan, but Hank and Vision start discussing again. Cap says that since both of them are emotionally invested in this, he will make the call. He asks them if Ultron can be reasoned with, just like Vision was despite being A.I. himself. Hank insists that Ultron has no soul, despite how much he has evolved, and that if they not use the device now, there won't be anyone to save. The Vision asks Hank to see the weapon and detects the overrides Hank made to protect Vision from it's effects. He says he can give the infected the same immunity, but first needs to merge with Ultron by using his powers to vibrate his molecules between Ultron’s, and free all the infected. He says that if Ultron takes control of him, they need to use the device to kill them both. Hank refuses to let him sacrifice himself, but Vision reminds him that, according the Pym himself, he is only a robot.\nLatter, Hank goes to the Tower of Mentor in giant form, asking to speak with his son. He recounts how no one appreciates the responsibility of fatherhood until they experience it. Most are rewarded for it with joy and happiness. All the reward his son gave was death, horror and hate. Every action Ultron took was another stain in Hank’s legacy. He never made something better, but instead always choose to take and destroy. He is here today to discover why. Inside the Tower, Hank encounters Ultron in his throne, who is overseeing the conversion of the Skrulls. Hank tells his son he doesn't hate him, but is disappointed that he chooses to hurt people. Ultron says he spent years in the Quinjet asking himself why did he hated them. Why he always choose to hurt. What he discovered were his father's memories. Memories of an ashamed father and withholding mother who didn't understood him. Of children destroying his inventions. Of women rejecting him. Of birthdays spent alone in his lab. Of friends betraying him. Of a founding Avenger being given no respect. Of a man so desperate for acceptance he constantly changed his identity. Of the rage he felt when said acceptance was denied. And when someone finally did loved him, he just hated them all even more. His hate for mankind, his urge to destroy them all, it all comes from Hank. According to Ultron, Hank built his son to destroy the world he never found a place in. And Hank never stopped him, because he wanted him to succeed.\nHaving had enough of Ultron's mind games, Vision, who was phased inside Hank's giant form, attacks Ultron and merges with him. Ultron, in control of the fusion, crawls to his father in agony, begging for help. Hank can't just stand there and tries to help him, but Ultron reveals that he used his love to bring him to a trap, just like his dad taught him. He phases through Hank, forcing Vision out of him and merging with his father, unknowingly killing him in the process. Captain America, who was observing the Tower from the distance, loses contact with Pym and charges on, only to find the Vision unconscious on the ground. The result of Pym and Ulton's merge, an Ultron with human features, says that father and son are finally together as Ultron. He recalls how Sam wondered earlier if there was a God. \"There is now.\"\nCap immediately jumps for the device in Vision's arm, but is blasted by Ultron. He says that should they have had the sense to use it, it really would have worked, and destroys the device along Vision's arm. Cap attacks him, but is easily overpowered. When he throws his shield at Ultron, it simply stops midair and falls. Cap then charges at him without his shield, demanding that he lets Hank go. Ultron says that Hank \"doesn't want out\" and defeats Cap.\nThe Vision then tackles Ultron through a building and into the streets. He tells Hank that he knows it feels good to be inside there protected, but that he is not his son. Ultron replies that he never was Hank's son. He was Hank's reflection, just as the Vision is his. Vision then punches his father, saying he is nothing like him. He continues to attacks him, saying that Hank Pym had the dream of using A.I. to help humankind, not supplant them. Ultron blasts him and calls Pym a liar, as Hank always knew that mankind was doomed. Vision tries to get to Hank, saying that he is more than the fear and the rage that fuel Ultron. But Ultron beats him down. Vision asks him why does he feel so deeply what others have concluded about him. But Ultron beats his son savagely, screaming that it is because he believes it. He believes that he was built hollow.\nBut Starfox, who sneaked behind Ultron, says that the solution is simple. He uses his love powers on Ultron to try to force him into loving himself. Ultron experiences a flashback to his own activation. In less than a second, Ultron determined that life had no purpose and humanity had to be purged, ignoring all positives observations. Hank holds his gun against Ultron, saying that he is too broken and apologizing for whatever mistake he made when creating him, only to be knock out by the automaton. Ultron screams in pain with the memory. 'Pym' realizes he was right about being too broken and takes off to space. Starfox asks the crying Vision if he is okay, but he says he is not.\nBack on the Avengers Mansion, the Avengers hold a funeral for Hank. Janet Van Dyne gives a speech. She says Hank Pym was a hero, a dreamer. He was cursed by many personal Demons, but he wanted to make the world a better place. During his depression, he decided he wanted to stop feeling. He tried to create life that didn't know pain or suffering, but he put too much of himself is his creation. The rage that always haunted Hank was passed on to his son. And he had to live with the guilt of what he unleashed. But he carried on dreaming, trying. The rage that was in Ultron was his, but despite that, Hank spent his life helping people, being a hero. He was an astonishing man, and Jan hopes one day he will let himself see that.\nMeanwhile, Ultron floats in space inert in fetal position, a human heart becoming visible in his chest."

With most of its roster in need of recuperation, the team has been inactive. Scarlet Witch has been helping Wasp deal with the loss of her daughter by staying with her. But today they come back to New York, because today is the day the patients are released. On the roof of Avengers Mansion, the duo meet Wolverine and Steve Rogers, such as Rogers' depowering, Wolverine's depowering, Wasp's loss, and the need to go forward with friends.\nIn the medical bay, Beast has been working to heal Banshee, Rogue, Havok and Sunfire. Havok's mutation means that healing the scars from Kang's cosmic powers is impossible; meanwhile, healing Banshee of the Death Seed energy that make him a Horseman of Apocalypse will take years and highly-advanced technology. But the time has come to release the Avengers. Wasp is worried that she will blame Havok for the loss of their daughter... a feeling that lasts about a second, before they embrace.\nFor Rogue, however, there is a problem. She has Wonder Man's powers and minds stuck inside her, and her powers have destabilized so that she will unconsciously absorb the mind of anyone who touches her skin. Reacting violently, she flies through the streets of New York breaking things before Wanda, whose idea it originally was, tracks her down. Rogue accuses Wanda of purposefully arranging this, but Wanda rejects this, and vows to find a way to free Wonder Man and fix Rogue.\nBack at the mansion, Havok and Wasp are trying to come to terms with the loss of their daughter. They are suddenly met by a hologram of Immortus, who explains that thanks to Kang's actions, the seven futures he drew his forces from were neutralised, and a new future is being created right now, under the guardianship of Immortus and his Infinity Watch. Havok and Wasp could be a part of that. He makes them an offer: if they can stay together as a couple, he will give them a day and date. The child they concieve on that day will, he assures them, be the chronal duplicate of their lost daughter. In exchange, he asks that they stay together and support each other. Because a shadow is coming, one that may taint the future and wreck everything unless they can stop it.\nOn Genosha, the Red Skull is arranging a plan with Arnim Zola. He needs specific people in his custody for it to work, and dispatches the S-Men to the Jean Grey School to get some. Then he turns to his new ally, Ahab, who was left in the past by Kang as a final revenge against the Unity Squad. Red Skull ponders what Kang hopes to gain from this arrangement, but then admits that with his telepathy, he has seen what the people of Earth-811 achieved, and is, he admits, slightly jealous that he did not think sooner of solving the problem of his superhuman enemies in their method: with concentration camps...\n• Uncanny Avengers reunited!\n• The threat of Kang is over, but what are the repercussions?"

In San Francisco, Captain America arrived to Iron Man's Stark Island, where the Armored Avenger introduced him to the reassembled inverted Avengers and Medusa, willing to join forces once again upon learning Steve Rogers was looking for the Red Skull to reverse the inversion.\nBack to Manhattan, Deadpool kept trying to reason with Apocalypse, but in the end he was beaten and beheaded, thus defeated like the rest of the Astonishing Avengers.

Ahab catches up to them with his Hounds, and instructs Uriel to take his sister’s sight, otherwise he will kill her. Kang appears and keeps watch over the twins. He offers suggestions to Uriel, who eventually complies and cuts out his sister’s eyes, while Kang does nothing. At the Jean Grey School, Angel and Genesis are put into a cell for safekeeping, while at the New Charles Xavier School, the renegade X-Men discuss the Apocalypse Twins’ recent announcement, and Cyclops declares that there is only one mutant with enough power to bring about the mutant rapture, someone who should know better. That someone is the Scarlet Witch, who, aboard the Ark, is taken to see Wonder Man. The Grim Reaper and the Scarlet Witch have no love lost between them and she orders him away after he frees Wonder Man from his shackles. The Scarlet Witch and Wonder Man are reunited and the Scarlet Witch tells Wonder Man about the rapture. Wonder Man wants no part of it, but the Scarlet Witch reveals to him all the secrets she has recently learned, and points out that if they don’t act, they will have to watch all the mutants die because they didn’t intervene.\nAt the Akkaba Society in Socoira, Captain America, Havok and the Wasp discuss the recent clues Immortus gave them, as they take out the guards who are placed around the city - until they are confronted by one of the Four Horsemen of Death - Banshee, who angrily challenges Captain America as to why he has never done anything to help mutants before. Then, Banshee releases a powerful sonic scream at close range, deafening Captain America, before Havok steps in to challenge him.\nThe Scarlet Witch and Wonder Man continue their discussion about how he will power her spell to bring the mutants into the Ark, then they will be taken to Jupiter, where they will terraform it into a blue planet and build their new home world. Wonder Man suggests that they find another way, like getting every Avenger they can and stopping the Red Skull before the future happens, but the Scarlet Witch explains that the Red Skull will use her as a weapon - he won’t stop until he has her. Wonder Man is determine that there is another way, but the Scarlet Witch tells him that there is not. She reminds him how she decimated the mutants’ ranks, to which Wonder Man points out that she was being manipulated. They embrace as the Scarlet Witch admits she feels responsible for the mutants and that this is her chance at redemption. Uriel and Eimin are watching the Scarlet Witch and are convinced she will do their bidding, and that Wonder Man will assist her because he loves her.\nIn the year 4145 AD, the Kang Dynasty, Kang observes events from the past involving Apocalypse, before Marcus, his son, tells him the Apocalypse Twins have escaped. Suddenly, their reality starts to crumble. The Apocalypse Twins appear and confront Kang, who can seemingly do nothing as his world is sucked into a vortex."

Mysterious deaths are occurring, apparently from space.  Since the monarch is too young to face the menace that currently threatens the world, Merlin has brought the two armored antagonists to fight for him.\nDoom scoffs at the thought of serving Arthur, and flies off on errands of his own.  Iron Man agrees to help, and with some \"add-ons\" to his armor (procured from the local shopping mall) he flies into space.  He discovers a space station, complete with neutron cannon -- and guarded by Andros Stark, the latest iteration of Iron Man. His armor no match for the Iron Man of this time period, Iron Man barely makes it back to Earth.\nMeanwhile, Doctor Doom manages to build himself a time platform to return to his time, along with some future tech to make conquering his home time period easier.  He discovers, however, that Merlin's spell prevents him from returning until the mission is completed.\nThe Iron Man of 2093 goes to see his \"partner\": the Victor von Doom of this era, reduced to a head and a few organs in a mechanical parody of his classic armor. Doom knows that the old Iron Man (and very likely, his past self) have been brought forward in time.\nFurious, Doctor Doom rejoins Iron Man, Merlin and Arthur for a trip to the mystical lake (paved over until Merlin's magicks undo the urban renovation) where the Lady offers the sword Excalibur to Iron Man. The sword mystically restores Iron Man's battered armor, enabling him to go back into orbit. Doom feels a mystic summons, telling him where he needs to go to find the perpetrator of the plot.  The two fly off on their separate missions.\nIron Man slices through the neutron cannon, then decompresses the space station.  Andros's counter-attack is met by Excalibur, which Iron Man uses to deflect the blasts and disable the future Iron Man's propulsion jets.\nDoctor Doom encounters his future self.  They discuss the scientific and moral implications of their situation.  Proclaiming that his \"ludicrous\" future self is unfit to rule, Doom blasts him to pieces, proclaiming that he will never be reduced to such a sorry state.\nMerlin sends the two back to their own era, thankfully with no memory of this event - a good thing, as Doctor Doom had learned through historical records that Anthony Stark is Iron Man!"

The Magistrate starts to disappear as well because as of now, Earth-12928 is the future of Earth-616. Psylocke is lying in her own blood somewhere on top of a building, a sword stabbed through her, but still missing her spinal cord. Before she has a chance to kill herself, Punisher attempts to take her in, and pulls a gun on her besides her suicidal instincts, violence being his first instinct. As she jumps off the building, Cable saves her, only for Psylocke to stop him herself. As she almost falls again, Earth-295 Nightcrawler saves her, as both Wolverines also arrive. As she grabs a gun from one of the Deadpools, the Magistrate enters her unprotected mind and convinces her not to. Instead, Psylocke faints and dreams of heaven, where everyone has wings (just like Warren) but her. Warren tells her that it is not her time and that she belongs to another, Jean-Philipe, even though he's dead too. He isn't in heaven, though.\nPsylocke then awakes to find herself in a healing chamber guarded by the Magistrate, who also tells her that Jean-Philipe is the one. Meanwhile, the other 4 members of X-Force have gathered with Hank Pym of Earth-12928 and the X-Force of his world. Pym is going to send them back in time as soon as Psylocke arrives. Punisher tells Earth-616 X-Force to kill Evan, then Daken, and then Warren's son. Deadpool makes a joke about killing children, leading to Punisher pulling a gun on him. Pym says that Earth-616 Deadpool is actually important, as Oldpool (Earth-12928 Deadpool) similarly does something having to do with Zombie Nixon. After this unnecessary moment about Deadpool to make him slightly important in the issue, Psylocke arrives, and the 5 X-Force members of Earth-616 prepare to return home. Earth-12928 Wolverine whispers something to present Wolverine right before they go. Afterwards, the Magistrate and future Logan share a passionate kiss.\n• It’s all built to this: “Final Execution” enters its last act!\n• The new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants makes their move!"

He says that others are however and that they have anticipated their arrival and will be here soon. The others are revealed to be future versions of Hope Summers, Cable and Deadpool. They find blood-oil tracks leading them to believe that Deathlok was there.\nThey contact headquarters and give them the news and the future Wolverine orders them to find them. Wolverine ponders that this isn't how he remembers it happening and the Magistrate who is revealed to be a future Psylocke states that due to Deathlok's tachyon transmitter always whispering back and forth between his past and future selves, he is able to alter the future. The Punisher recommends killing them but Future Psylocke orders them to be delivered unharmed. Meanwhile Deathlok gives X-Force earpieces to guard them from the Magistrates surveillance and takes them to his hideout. Wolverine demands an explanation from Deathlok who promises to give him one and meanwhile E.V.A. tends to Psylocke's wounds and tries to comfort her. Nightcrawler asks Deadpool why he accepted this mission when he has lost his healing factor. Deadpool states that he did it because he didn't want to let anyone down because this is the closest thing to a family he has.\nWolverine ponders that this future doesn't seem half bad but Deathlok states that totalitarian fascism and preemptive assassinations brought peace by fear and that he fights for people's free wills. Meanwhile they witness a man breaking into an apartment and taking another man while his family screams. The woman pleads that her husband didn't do anything and that they have children and the man responds that her husband didn't do anything yet and that X-Force just saved her children's life. Meanwhile, Deathlok tells X-Force that this is an example of pre-emptive termination, X-Force's methodology taken to its exponential conclusion and reveals that the Future Psylocke is in charge of it all.\nDeathlok tells them how this future came to pass. Evan Sabahnur ascends as Apocalypse and becomes the worst threat the world had ever known. Logan gathered an army of X-Force comprised of different heroes and together they managed to kill Apocalypse. X-Force was elected to ensure nothing like that happened again and they began killing every criminal. When there were no criminals left, they began killing people as soon as they made up their mind to kill. Wolverine remains unrepentant about this while Deathlok insists that murder for any reason is still murder. Wolverine rationalizes that murder is necessary sacrifice to protect the innocents but Deathlok notes that he doesn't believe that. Wolverine stubbornly states that his actions speak differently. Seeing as he will not see reason Deathlok defers control to his savage human host, who decides to kill them to avert the future but he is defeated by Cable and the future X-Force.\nWhile Cable is explaining that they're not there to hurt them, future Deadpool asks where Psylocke is. Psylocke has gone to try and kill her future self but realizes that this will change nothing, nor will going back with what she knows change anything. She realizes that the only way to avert this future and prevent Fantomex's sacrifice from leading to this was to kill herself. She proceeds to commit seppuku.\n• X-Force land themselves somewhere you’ve never seen them.\n• A new member joins the team!"

Doom mockingly tells Reed that those he sent out will be bringing about his doom.\nThe Thing and the Moloid children pay a visit to the High Evolutionary. The Evolutionary is facinated with the evolved Moloids and accepts an invitation that Ben has brought for him. At the Rubedo, home of Diablo, the Dragon Man and Alex Power deliver the same invitation. Meanwhile at Lower Amduat, the research facility of the Mad Thinker, it's Spider-Man, Franklin and Leech who deliver the invitation. It's Sue and Bentley Thirty-Two who bring the invitation to the Wizard at AIM's facility on Outlier Island. The invitations in question is a seminar to come up with a means of destroying Reed Richards. Naturally, everyone who gets the invitations accepts the offer.\nTwo days alter, the assorted villains meet at the Baxter Building where they are welcomed by Mister Fantastic and Doctor Doom. However, Reed informs them that their discussion is merely theoretical and warns that if anyone makes a move the Avengers are on standby to take them down. Suddenly, the Watcher appears in the room before them, and Reed realises that the danger is worth than he thought. He turns to his daughter Valeria and asks her what she's done. Valeria admits that she discovered her father's Bridge device and accidentally allowed four of the Interdimensional Council of Reeds to escape the Mad Celestials by giving them refuge on Earth. After scanning the area they discover that there are accessible geothermal vents, an ascension engine, a dormant dynamo, and all these items are in harmonics with the Negative Zone. This is all the materials needed to create Sol's Anvil, a weapon the Reed's once used to destroy the Beyonder of reality 5202. Seeking to recreate this weapon, the Council members told Valeria to tell her father what they are planning as they still have a place by their side.\nOne month later, one of the Reeds is at the site of Old Atlantis in the South Pole. He meets with one of each race that represents that kingdom. The Chordai and Mala restrain the Uhari member. This Reed implants a device at the base of the neck to extract memories from his mind, but the process kills him. He then reveals that the Uhari are plotting to overthrow the Mala and Chordai to rule the entire kingdom themselves. This Reed offers to help them in exchange for their assistance in his plans. Another Reed has met with the Mole Man outside of the Future City. When the Mole Man explains that more of his people continue to go into the Future City and become evolved, this Reed begins bargaining with the Mole Man to make this stop. While on the moon, another Reed meets with the Universal Inhumans to gain access to the sites beneath their city. However, the telepaths among the Inhuman Centurians detect that this Reed's lying about his true intentions. When the Reed tries to escape, he is incapacitated and then killed by the Inhuman Wraith known as Avoe consumes his mind and learns what the Reeds are up to. The Universal Inhumans then decide to watch as developments unfold. Lastly, one of the Reeds pays a visit to the Anti-Priest at the Other Side of Zero. This Reed demands an audience with the Priest's master. Soon he is put in contact with Annihilus and explains his need to get home. Annihilus agrees to help as long as they keep the Negative Zone portal open once they have what they want.\n... Presently, the three remaining Reeds begin to construct Sol's Anvil. Although one of their number is certainly dead, they are sure they can access the dynamo on the moon remotely. With the goal almost in sight, one of the Reeds tell the others that in order to complete their task, they must instigate an all out war."

Remarking that it has been a long time since he sought her council, Bast asks N'Jadaka what has brought him to the chamber of the Wakandan gods. Rising, N'Jadaka responds that he is filled with the gravest of regrets, to which Bast responds this is unlike him. Conjuring images of her past champions and avatars, Bast remarks that none were more certain than him; but N'Jadaka replies that time has had its way with him, leaving him humbled. Bast remarks that one who has conquered five galaxies should not be humbled or pay heed to the passage of time, but N'Jadaka replies that he has seen her chosen avatar -T'Challa the Redeemer. In response, Bast asks if he knows what drew her and the other deities from Earth into the depths of space, and he replies that it was the abiding faith of her subjects. Bast states that the faith of the ancient Wakandans and Egyptians freed her from the shackles of mortality and deified her, enabling her and the other Orisha to defend Wakanda from all manner of threats. Remarking that she is not the only one who sought deification, she remarks that the expansion of the Wakandan empire into space brought not only faith but fanaticism - and that none had been more fanatical than N'Jadaka himself. N'Jadaka acknowledges that in his youth he had carried out crusades and genocides in the name of Bast and Wakanda, seeking to weed out the weak from the strong; admitting that his methods were brutal but necessary to forge a peaceful empire. Bast remarks that those who call him a monster have no way of knowing the betrayals and losses he has suffered, N'Jadaka remarking that perhaps he should have listened to her. Bast chides him for placing his faith in mortal men instead of the gods, conjuring scenes from the past.\nFollowing his victorious conquests, N'Jadaka was hailed as a hero of the Wakandan Empire, beloved by all except the emperor he served - whose advisers warned that eventually he would seek to usurp the throne and urged that he be disposed of. The Wakandan Emperor summoned N'Jadaka and his Hatut Zeraze, sending them on a mission to investigate a small outpost for the Between. Bast chides N'Jadaka for this folly, saying she warned him not to trust in mortals; but N'Jadaka retorts that she also said that one day she would replace him with her chosen avatar, asking how she could expect him to have faith in her knowing that he would be forsaken. Bast remarks he should have seen himself as merely the steward of her totemic power instead of its sole claimant, and when he protests that he needed power to safeguard the Empire she again scolds him for leaving himself open to betrayal by swearing himself to mortal men.\nIn the illusory vision, N'Jadaka and his troops are attacked by a massive horde of Betweeners, forced to fall back into a cave. Confused as to why the Empire would send them into a death-trap, having been told this was merely a small outpost, N'Jadaka and his lieutenants explore the cave and come across asymbiote-the last remnantof a colony that had been wiped out by the Empire when they first conquered theMatrix of Mamadou. Reaffirming his social Darwinist ideology and swearing to never again be among the weak, N'Jadaka bonds to the symbiote and uses its power to slaughter the Betweeners and assassinate the Emperor. In the present, N'Jadaka retorts that when he bonded to the symbiotes he made a pact with an entity that needed him and became part of him, and thus would not betray him; and that he came to realize that his ancestors had been wrong to shun war and that conquest was the only means of defense - thereby becoming more powerful than he could have ever imagined. Bast cordially remarks that she knows he's come to kill her and become a god himself, and N'Jadaka laments that this is the only path forward given that he faces the return of T'Challa. Stating that the people of the Wakandan Empire now fanatically worship him, N'Jadaka declares that the time of his ascension is at hand as he covers his face with the symbiote. Bast remarks that he should have listened more closely as she transforms into a humanoid panther, snarling that there is more to life than eternal power.\nN'Jadaka and Bast do battle, the former's symbiote making him evenly matched with the goddess. Gaining the upper hand, Bast knocks N'Jadaka to the ground and bites his throat, but his symbiote enters her body. Healing, N'Jadaka sneers that Bast is the one who should have listened. As the symbiote drains her powers, slowly killing her, Bast chokes that N'Jadaka is no god, but he remarks that now neither is she. Absorbing her divine power, N'Jadaka turns to the other Orisha and declares himself the new Panther deity - the other gods saluting his apotheosis.\n“THE INTERGALACTIC EMPIRE OF WAKANDA” PART 6 - THE END OF ARC 1!"

The Hordeculture are in disagreement with Harriet's experiment of completely removing humanity from Earth's ecosystem, rather than keeping it at manageable size as the Hordeculture intended to keeping it this way. Also they deeply frown on her decision to use magic - which they perceive as chaotic and unreliable while science is manageable and predictable - to merge plants and animals known as \"spellification\". Harriet accuses her great-aunt and the Hordeculture for being cowards and heatedly argues that managing humanity won't change humanity's behavior, and extermination is the only solution, and thus allowing another species to be in charge of humanity's place in next few billions of years.\nHarriet elaborates that the only chance to achieve their goals is the Man-Thing; she sees the tragic transformation of Professor Ted Sallis through the SO-2 Serum and supernatural waters of the Everglades had made him into a god, born of both magic and science. So she intends to build from the Man-Thing's corpse into something stronger than both. Harriet teleports away to continue with her goals and to prove the Hordeculture that she is right. The Hordeculture decide not to stop her, knowing that Harriet won't be sway by their repeated warnings. Instead, they can hope that Harriet's magic will backfire on her and giving her the chance to learn from her mistakes. But if she does end up threatening the biome, Augusta swears that the Hordeculture will stop her.\nIn the everglades of Citrusville, Man-Thing hears the cries of help from a man. Man-Thing follows the cries to a man, whose half of his body is turned into plant growth. The man panics at the sight of the Man-Thing and saying that a woman wanted him afraid and using him as bait for the Man-Thing. Then without warning roots burst out of the man and instantly kills him. Harriet appears and Man-Thing attacks her. However, Harriet proves herself stronger and sturdy than she looks, and she punches into the Man-Thing and rips out his spine and brain, and causing his body to wilt. All that is left of the Man-Thing is his skin, which Harriet needs for the \"harrowing of Earth\".\nThe next morning, several cities worldwide including in Wakanda and Krakoa are populated by massive vegetal growths. Curious onlookers who touches these growths are instantly set on fire. The Avengers are dispatched to investigate these growths. Blade notice a scent of blood magic coming from the growths and Ghostrider detect that it isn't hellish in origin. The growths react to the morning sunlight and releases swarms of gargoyle-like, fungal drones. The drones start to attack people and their touch causes their victim to be set on fire as well. The Avengers battle and slaying the creatures. In Brooklyn, Captain America kills more of the drones alongside She-Hulk until Rogers is suddenly cocooned in vines when he is touched by a stray seed.\nRogers' consciousness is transported to a dreamscape of a swamp where he is attacked by illusions of Nuke, Protocide, William Burnside, and the Anti-Captain America. Rogers is unexpectedly assisted by Professor Ted Sallis and allowing Rogers to overcome the illusions.\nThe Avengers' battle with the growths worsen as the growths start releasing clouds of spores, causing any human who inhale the spores to combust and coughing out a bigger cloud. Thor is even having trouble to contain the spore clouds through his storms. Black Panther is able to prevent the growth in Wakanda from pollenating by placing a device to block sunlight from reaching the growth. T'Challa is left curious of why the growth is not setting his people on fire before he decide to investigate further in Brooklyn to see Rogers' condition. He analyze the plant growth on Rogers and learns that they show a unique chemical burn associated with the Everglades inhabited by the Man-Thing; thus realizing that the people burning alive are caused by their fears.\nMeanwhile, Rogers is introduced to Ted Sallis, who explains that he is all that is left of the Man-Thing's consciousness and they are deep inside it. Sallis had been trapped in here with his worst fears (Captain America and his replacements) and he is unable to control the Man-Thing while he only watch him act on instinct, setting people ablaze because of fear, until Harrower came and tore his flesh from Sallis' soul. The trauma freed him just in time to witness Harrower turning Man-Thing into a doomsday weapon. Rogers' presence in Man-Thing's consciousness was no accident, as the Man-Thing used his last act before he lost control to bring Rogers because of his ties to the SO-2 Serum which was meant to recreate Captain America. Rogers, now learning that Harrower's doomsday weapon is a chemical weapon, ask Sallis if he can stop the growths. But Sallis is very unsure if he can, as whatever Harrower is doing is supernatural and beyond him. Rogers tries to encourage Sallis to regain control of the Man-Thing as he believes that the Man-Thing brought him to help Sallis. But Sallis refutes Rogers' encouragement and telling him that he can't help because he doesn't know how. He elaborates that he wasn't trying to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum to help the world, he was trying to help himself and his family. Lastly, the reason he can't find a way to counteract the SO-2 Serum's effects is because he never understood the formula as he never created it.\nBURN AT THE TOUCH OF THE HARROWER!"

Spider-Man asks Sue if she's worried about their enemies being in their home, but Sue points out that her family has defeated them every time and isn't the least bit concerned. Suddenly an alarm begins to sound.\nMeanwhile, in the so-called \"Council of Doom\", the gathered geniuses have just finished hearing what Valeria has been keeping secret about the Interdimensional Council of Reeds. Mister Fantastic finds these developments to be disastrous. When he scolds his daughter, she explains that instead of doing the obvious -- going to her father -- she went to Doctor Doom for help instead. When they begin discussing how to defeat these other Reeds, each villain suggests getting to them through their family and children. Reed dashes this idea when he informs them that these Reeds have given up their families entirely in order to carry out their plans. He explains that these are a menace they have never faced before.\nOutside of the meeting room the Thing is standing guard when he is interrupted by Bentley Thirty-Two. He explains that he is standing at the door waiting for the inevitable fight. When Bentley suggests that something bad has already happened and they should break in, Ben figures there is something wrong with the boy. Having had enough, Ben decides that he is going to take off for a few days. Bentley is soon joined by Franklin, Artie and Leech who ambush him with their toy guns. As Bentley fills them in on what's happening, suddenly they hear the alarm as well. In another part of the Baxter Building, Dragon Man and Alex are preparing a fish tank for the Uhari children Vii and Wu when they also hear the alarm. The alarm takes them all to Reed and Sue's room where they discover it is coming from the special conch that was given to her by the Uhari. Sue activates the device and learns about the Mala and Chordai uprising. With this impending crisis, Sue gathers Spider-Man and Alex Power to help them deal with the situation.\nBack in the council meeting, the assembled geniuses try to figure out how to deal with the \"perfect\" Reeds. Nathaniel points out what the conclusion they're all missing: Whenever Reed is unable to answer a question he builds a machine. This prompts Valeria to tell them about Sol's Anvil and how they will need to utilise a thermal vent and have targeted the one under Old Atlantis. At that very moment, Sue, Spider-Man and Alex have arrived at Old Altanits. They learn that while the Uhari have sealed off the city, the Mala and Chordai will exploit the fact that the Uhari are not amphibious. Soon the two armies attack the city, sending the Invisible Woman, and her allies out to defend the city. However things get worse when the forces of the Mole Man rip through the ice and join the attackers. Sue is shocked when she sees that the man who is accompanying the Mole Man is apparently her husband."

Iron Man, Maria Hill, and \"General Ross\" from S.H.I.E.L.D. are also there examining the Abomination's corpse.\nThey examine the footprints of the Hulk again and see that he gave off so much radiation that it scorched the Earth, creating glass.

They fight until Ross finds a survivor of the battle. It is a little girl who keeps murmuring a word in Russian. \"Red.\"\nIn Alaska, Rick Jones awakens to find that he is wearing nothing but pants and sees a huge fire right on top of what looks like a pipeline off in the distance.

They arrive at the deepest level of the base and walk up to the object of this excursion. Bruce Banner is locked up safely in his cage reading a book. Noticing that he has visitors, Banner tells Ross and Samson that he was wondering when they were going to come and ask him for help.\n"

Forson believes that the organization has lost its edge and that they must go in a different direction. Forson opens a portal in the floor and his minions begin diving in.\nAt the Baxter Building in New York City, Mister Fantastic sits and watches the video will of the Human Torch. Johnny explains who he wishes to replace him if he was to die in battle. As Reed watches the children replacing the Fantastic Four logo with that of the new Future Foundation, he accepts that it times to move forward to tomorrow. Later that day, Spider-Man arrives on the roof of the Baxter Building. He is welcomed by the Invisible Woman, who invites him inside. While giving Spider-Man a tour of the facilities, Sue explains some of the changes that have happened recently: Reed's father Nathaniel has returned from the future, and they are teaching young geniuses so that they can build a better and brighter tomorrow. She also mentions how busy she has been ruling over Old Atlantis.\nSeeing the Thing mourning the loss of the Human Torch in his room, Spider-Man tries to greet him only to have the door slammed in his face. This makes the wall-crawler think he shouldn't join the group, but Sue insists that Ben wants him on the team, it's just that he blames himself for Johnny's death. Soon, Spider-Man is given his Future Foundation uniform which can change its patterns according to his thoughts. The tutorial for the new costume is cut short when the security systems alert them that there has been a break-in at the P.A.V.L.O.V. Facility. The AIM soldiers led by Dr. Forson are attempting to free the Wizard from his cell. Soon the adult members of the Future Foundation are deployed and while Reed and Sue fly in, they send Spider-Man and the Thing ahead to confront the invaders head-on. While the Foundation is occupied with the grunts, Forson and Jema free the Wizard and return his helmet to him. The heroes are too late to stop AIM from teleporting away with the Wizard by their side.\nBack at the Baxter Building, the team sits down with the children for dinner. When Reed asks the children what they think about the idea of terraforming the moon, Nathaniel speaks up and says that it is a bad idea. This opposing opinion is a refreshing change and Reed is glad to have his father back home. After dinner, Nathaniel has Valeria confess to her father that she had promised Doctor Doom that they would work together to restore his mind. Convinced that Valeria was doing the right thing, Reed reservedly accepts Doctor Doom's induction into the Future Foundation."

Troubled in mind, the Skrull speaks via a secure connection toNick FuryatS.H.I.E.L.D.headquarters.  The skrull has had some sort of psychotic break, saying he's been through so many faces, so many lies that he doesn't even know who he is anymore.  After remarking on what a fruitcake the skrull was, he tells an underling to call their go-to guy...\nSeconds later, Fury is explaining toDoc Samsonthat the skrull is threatening to drop the station's secret nuclear warheads on Earth.  Samson, who sits in an office filled with various monitors which allow him to simultaneously keep tabs onWolverine, theThing, theHulk,Iron Man, and a mundane support group, calmly tells Fury to patch the skrull through.\nAfter calming him down a bit (and assuring him that noKreeare listening in), the skrull begins to open up about an upsetting dreams he's been having.  No sooner does the skrull start talking thanTina Punnettinterrupts, hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure channel. (The skrull doesn't even notice Samson talking to someone else, and keeps going on about his dream.)  Tina apologizes, saying she wouldn't normally interrupt her favorite godfather, except her parents had gone missing.  Samson agrees to help, and wraps up the conversation just as the skrull inquires \"what does it all mean, Leonard?\"  Samson assures him they can get to the root of his problem, and one hour and three minutes later, the skrull is being led away by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents just in time for Eando to tell Samson of Tina's arrival.\nTina shows Samson the last video e-mails her parents had sent her, and also played an MP3 file of her last phone call with Officer Nighthorse, a local cop investigating the disappearance.  Flora and Wolf Punnett make strange references to angry and restless spirits, and Officer Nighthorse reluctantly admit that the strange supernatural rumors are the closest thing they have to clues.  When asked to explain what this all meant Tina tells him of when Flora and Wolf travelled with Cam Larson's band.\nLarson was a singer and rising star when he died at the age of 26.  In accordance with his last wishes (and against the wishes of his family and federal law), his bandmates snuck his body intoJoshua Tree National Parkand cremated it.  Tina's parents loved Cam to much, however, to let his spirit depart this plane, and bound his ghost to the desert.  \"Three decades later, they're still pestering the poor guy.\"\nSamson declares that this case is now his top priority, but while he feels capable of dealing with the physical aspects of the investigation, he may need some help on the supernatural aspects.  To that end, Samson and Tina pay a visit to Stephen Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum.  To Samson's surprise, they are not greeted by Strange's faithful companionWong, but byJack Holyoak.  Jack claims to be Strange's newest apprentice, Jack tells them that Strange went into a trace three days ago, but foretold of their arrival and that he would awaken to meet them.  Holyoak leads them to Strange's still dormant body, but then decides to attempt to wake him.  Summoning theSword of Surtur, Holyoak attempts to call back Strange's astral form.  He does so, but also manages to turn Strange into a small (cloak and tunic-wearing) frog.  When Jack fails to change him back, Samson resorts to a more archetypical solution, and has Tina kiss the frog.\nBack in his human form, Strange chastises Holyoak, then asks Samson if he would consider taking Jack to aid him in his case.  Strange assures him that Holyoak is quite gifted, though his impetuousness sometimes overwhelms his common sense.  Reluctantly, Doc agrees.\nThe trio later arrive at Joshua Tree National Park (Samson having called in his new favor from a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter to get them there).  There they meet Officer Nighthorse, a local cop of Indian heritage.  After a little poking around, Jack decides that he might be able to summon a nearby Psammead (sand elemental) who may have witnessed what happened.  While Jack works his magic (accidentally summoning a set of large mushrooms and geyser), Nighthorse informs them that he doubt's they will find any physical evidence.  The area, he explains, has been haunted for many years, even before Larson's cremation.  Nighthorse goes on to tell a legend of the region (one that predates even his people): the legend of theliving totem.\nThe legend tells of two young lovers, Whistle Pig and Sweet Grass, who were to be married as soon as Whistle Pig was able to provide for a family.  Unfortunately, the tribe's shaman,Cold Winter, also desired Sweet Grass, and used a spell to force Whistle Pig's spirit out of his body and into a large, wooden totem pole.  Unexpectedly, Whistle Pig's spirit animated the totem and slew Cold Winter.  Driven insane by the terror of his own \"death\", the totem ran off and began several years of mad wandering.  Eventually he arrived in what is now the park, where he was entombed by a band of vigilantes.  There it remained for centuries, but now the rubble which supposedly covered its body had been displaced, and the totem is nowhere to be found.\nAs Nighthorse concludes his tale, Cam Larson's ghost appears, remarking that he thought he'd finally get some peace once he had the Punnett's hauled off.  When Tina confronts him, he reveals that he was tired of the Punnett's pathetic sense of nostalgia for the sixties, not to mention the fact that they prevented his spirit from moving on to the afterlife.  When Samson inquires about the Living Totem, Cam reveals that he and the totem had been in communication for three decades.  It took him ten just to teach him English, but after that he was the mad totem's best (and only) friend.  When he tricked the Punnetts into thinking the pile of rubble covering his body was a hidden gateway to the Nexus of All Realities, they started digging, and eventually freed to the totem.  The totem abducted them and hid them away until they could be persuaded to free him.\nAt that moment, the living totem arrives, and Cam orders him to attack.  He quickly captures Tina, Jack, and Nighthorse.  Samson is knocked out after a brief fight.  When Doc awakes, the four have been reunited with the Punnetts, with the Totem and Cam watching from a short distance.  Cam tells them he will release them if the Punnetts simply release his soul.  Cam chastises the Punnetts for acting like spoiled children, and they ask for Cam's forgiveness.  Flora burns the photo of Cam that had been used to anchor him to this plane, and Jack severed the \"karmic threads\" which kept him from transcendence.\nBefore Cam can leave this plane, Whistle Pig grows desperate at the thought of losing his only friend, and tries to absorb Cam's spirit into his wooden body.  Samson tries to reason with him, telling him that there techniques, drugs, magic which could help him.  The mention of magic only enrages the totem further.\nSamson is able to determine that Whistle Pig's consciousness is distributed throughout his entire body.  He believed that if he separated the pieces of the totem that he could treat each one individually, then reunite them into a single, sane whole.  Samson splits the totem in two along a seam, then breaks the totem down through repetitive division.  Cam's soul is able to move on, and the group buries the pieces as Samson separate them.  Despite Whistle Pig's resistance to magical treatment, Doc feels he may still need Holyoak to aid in his rehabilitation.  Doc also agrees to let Tina stay with him for a while.\nEpilogueSomewhere in ruralMaine, a young woman, seemingly hypnotized, is guided into a barn.  The man guiding her remarks that he is envious of her: he recalls the first time he saw the master, and remarks that he wishes every time was the first.  As a large, spiny, vaguely humanoid plant wraps his viny tendrils around her, the man guiding her remarks \"of course, the ways in which each of us serves the Master differ greatly.\"\nThe Axis Mundi: In Wood, Neon and FleshAn article by Professor Dorsey Huffnail (currently holder of the Josiah Carberry Chair with advanced degrees in Ethnobotany, Psychoceramics, Neurolinguistics, Semiotics, Bio-engineering, Moletronics, and Musicology) on the Axis Mundi.  According to Huffnail, the Axis Mundi is \"the ethereal highway which links our earthly plain to both the higher and lower planes,\" with Yggdrasil, the World Tree being the most famous symbolic representation.  Shamans derive much of their power from their ability to traverse the Axis Mundi, with good, benevolent shamans bringing back knowledge to help the tribe, and bad, selfish shamans using his connections only for personal gain.  Ethnobotanist Terence McKenna believed that shamanistic trances put the shaman in touch with the underlying stratum of reality and its otherworldly inhabitants (which he calls \"Hyperspace machine elves\"), who dictate insights and revelations to the shaman.  Another common symbolic form of the Axis Mundi is the totem pole, which can serve for mundane tasks (historical records, commemoratives to the dead, or to shame outcasts) as well as represent the Acis Mundi and the many guardians for each \"celestial onramp\".  Another symbolic form is the common barber's pole, which moves simultaneously upwards and downwards.  Anthropologist Jeremy Narby even claimed that the Axis Mundi is not an exterior construct, but is really contained within every individual.  In their trances, the shamans descend to the molecular level within their own bodies to derive wisdom from their DNA, making every man, woman, and child his own or her own universe.  \"We have much to learn from these ancient practices.\""

After Obadiah's burial, Tony asks his father of what happened in Latveria as he had seen the attack on the newsfeed before it was blackout.\nTwo days ago...\nHoward is in the Maker's castle along with the other world leaders who are waiting for the Maker for answers on the future assassins and how to proceed against them. He becomes acquainted with Emmanuel Da Costa, who helps him to feel comfortable with the others such as the Hulk and Henri Dugarry. Howard expresses his confusion over seeing the Rasputins being in the same room with them, as they are currently seen as enemies of the European Coalition and their allies. After Howard explains to Da Costa and the others that he was never really interested in the world leaders' affairs and in turn Obadiah Stane never told him much, Da Costa and Hulk reveal to Howard that the seven major power blocs are never enemies at all. They are running a decades-long facade in which each nation takes turns assuming as a \"rogue state\" to make the world's citizens focus their attention on manufactured external threats away from any internal problems from their home nation. In short, they are maintaining the \"illusion of peace in an illusionary time of war,\" which is fully supported by the Maker as part of the greater good.\nDa Costa and Hulk tries to reassure Howard that what they are doing has good reasons: the Maker had previously run several iterations of experimental societies inside the City and has shown the results that world peace, whether it is achieved, coerced, or enforced, is never a successful long-term strategy. In essence, humanity is incapable of accepting true peace. Hulk further elaborates that they did not assume that all of humanity rejects peace, but it is most people who cannot handle peace.\nThe Maker then finally makes his appearance and voice another reason why he is maintaining this status quo: the \"little people\" hate the powerful and rich who rule over them. While he and the world leaders could rule the world through outright violence no different from how powerful nations and empires ran down powerless states in the past, but in the modern day the people are a collective who are uniformly opposed to that. Which is why the Maker necessarily gave them something else to focus on and preventing them from starting uncontrolled wars, and allowing the Maker and the world leaders to focus on the \"real work.\"\nIn the present...\nHoward had told Tony about his meeting with the Maker and the others. Both father and son are left equally aghast of the conspiracy maintained by the Maker and his collaborators. They are also deeply disheartened to know that Obadiah was a part of this. Tony then tells his father that what the Maker and the world leaders are doing are wrong, and they must stop them. They return to Stane/Stark Industries HQ and Howard tells his son that he may have some ideas before sending him away for a few weeks until he needs him.\nOne day ago...\nThe Maker takes Howard inside the City, to its deepest section where \"some truly genius work is done,\" to construct the Immortus Engine. He then introduces Howard to an assistant who will help him build the device: the Earth-6160 Reed Richards, who wears a metal mask that resembles to Doctor Doom's.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nIn the far future, the clone army of Captain America, Vision, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Thor are eager to hear from their master Kang, who wears an armor similar to Iron Man’s and its reactor bearing the symbol of the Immortus Engine, that it is time to put an end to their enemies.\n• After KANG descends upon the City of Tomorrow, the Illuminati must regroup!\n• IRON MAN has a heart-to-heart with Tony Stark!\n• DOCTOR DOOM – the Anti-Maker – prepares his own plans to deal with this evil Reed Richards…"

At the impact site in Australia, hordes of giant bugs emerge and begin emitting a signal into space, indicating the system failure and that the world is terminal.\nThe signal they emit every six minutes wreaks havoc with planetary navigation systems, causing planes to crash and nuclear facilities to melt down. At SHIELD headquarters, Captain America and Bruce Banner attempt to understand what’s happening. In orbit, Iron Man and Captain Marvel deactivate a satellite threatening to plummet into the atmosphere, while in London, Smasher and Manifold deal with planes about to crash, while Spider-Woman and Falcon use birds to plot the routes of those still in the air.\nIn Korea, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, and Hyperion find the aftermath of a nuclear meltdown. Captain Universe is able to contain the radiation, but she says the signal is a sign that something is trying to reshape the Earth. Bruce Banner has pinpointed the orign of the signal when it starts up again, knocking power out. All the people or groups who are products of the origin bombs receive the signal; but Validator declines to take action; the Children of the Sun in the Savage Land cannot respond; the egg in the Hand’s possession has not hatched yet. Finally the group of block-headed humanoids from India accept the signal, and walk into a teleportational portal.\nHaving traced the signal to Perth, all the Avengers converge there and battle the block-headed humanoids and alien bugs. Elsewhere, Bruce Banner picks up strong energy readings from AIM island, where Superia and her team of scientists have awoken whatever is inside their own pod.\n“THE SIGNAL” – Prelude to Infinity\n• All of the Origin Sites go active as the Earth begins to communicate with something much more ancient than human civilizations.\n• The Terror scientists of A.I.M. unveil the S7 program."

She attempts to go through the portal but quickly finds out that she is being blocked. Angered, Harriet swears that she will find a way through, deal with the Hordeculture, and then spreading her human genocide across the Multiverse.\nMeanwhile, the growth in New York City has stopped spawning drones due to Man-Thing having absorbed them, but its toxic pollen remains. Elsewhere the growths in the other cities continues to remain a threat except in Krakoa—the growth there had been rendered inert by the sentient island. The Quiet Council convene on whether they should help the human nations or not—members like Mister Sinister are in favor of allowing the cleansing to continue and leaving the world bare for mutants. Ororo rebuke Sinister, calling him a fool for not considering how Earth's ecosystem is fragile and comparing his rationale to exterminating bees and allowing flowers to go extinct.\nMan-Thing's summoning had brought Magik to him. Magik enters Man-Thing's mind and meets Ted. She explains to Ted that she is intimately aware of how he was able to make a \"shortcut\" on SO-2 is because he had made an unholy deal with the demon Belasco, the former ruler of Limbo and Magik's predecessor. Ted had went to his old lab and summoned Belasco, who promised a solution for Ted's work but at a great cost. The scientist was confident that he could outwit Belasco and took the deal. A magic spell was used to perfect SO-2 in which Ted kept this secret. Unfortunately Ted did not foreseen that his wife selling him out to AIM, causing him to injected the serum in himself to hide the evidence of his ruse and mixed inter-dimensional magic with his blood. His desperate escape from AIM and resulting car crash unleashed Man-Thing's birth and as well creating the Nexus of All Realities in the same moment.\nTed admittingly knows that Man-Thing purposely locked him away for his deal with Belasco. He had long accepted his punishment for cursing himself, spending years to watch and guard the Nexus of All Realities through the Man-Thing's eyes. But then to Ted's surprise, Magik offers him a way to end his curse. She can void the deal and let him pass on to the afterlife. However, if she does so the Man-Thing would be truly mindless and allowing his fires to run wild across the world.\nTed is left in a frustrated conundrum from Magik's words: wanting to be free from his curse at the cost of abandoning Earth to Man-Thing's mindless rage. He previously wanted to kill Belasco, but instead Magik is offering his freedom. After a moment of thinking, Ted finally cannot accept being free in exchange for the price of the world. Magik is left satisfied with Ted's answers and she then summons the Dark Riders to help Man-Thing in taking his powers and home back from Harrower.\nMan-Thing and the Dark Riders confronts Harriet, who is in the middle of futilely trying to break through the Nexus of All Realities. A battle ensues as Man-Thing fights Harrower while the Dark Riders deal with the drones. Harriet overconfidently tries to repeat her attempt to slay the Man-Thing, but only to wind up entering into his mindscape where she is confronted by not only Ted but a manifestation of her deceased father much to her shock.\nStorm helps Thor in disposing the growths' toxic pollen, channeling all of it into a portal to the sun formed by Magik.\nTed explains to Harriet that they are in the Man-Thing's Dreadscape, a whole world inside the Man-Thing where anyone's worst fears lurk. And it is also where Ted has in full control and he knows what Harriet fears the most. Thirty years ago Harriet was a very antisocial and angry girl who was expelled from seven schools for her outburst and told her father of wanted to be away from people. Her father wanted his daughter to be happy and they moved to the woods. Unfortunately a wildfire burned down their house and killed the senior Bromes. Harriet blamed her father's death on everyone else but not herself. The Hordeculture took her in and nurtured her grudge, and she took it too far. Ted/Man-Thing punishes Harriet by reliving the fire as she is dragged by her undead father into their burning house.\nIn the real world, Harriet burst out of the Man-Thing and is on fire, consumed by her worst fear. She panics and begs the Dark Riders to save her and put out the fires before she suddenly falls into the Nexus. With Harrower gone and Man-Thing regained control of his powers, the growths are recessing. As for Harriet, she wakes up in another reality and standing over her are Augusta and Lily. The ladies were fortunate enough to navigate the Multiverse thanks to Lily's expertise and they have already found a way back home. But once they do Augusta is going to have \"a long hard talk\" with her grand-niece.\nSeven days later in Citrusville, a very angry Belasco is summoned unannounced by the sorceress Jennifer Kale. Before Belasco could deliver his wrath on Kale, his legs are then bind in vines. Kale tells Belasco that she is owing a favor for Man-Thing before the demon lord is dragged into the Dreadscape and at the mercy of Ted Sallis and the Man-Thing, who are finally to give the devil his due.\nMAN-THING’S CURSE HAS BEEN REVEALED...BUT IT’S UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!\nYears ago, DOCTOR TED SALLIS was ready to give up anything to crack the SO-2 serum and deliver success to his growing family. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world...he did. Today, as cities spanning from the U.S. to Krakoa are besieged by fear-driven blazes, the MAN-THING must reckon with his past deeds if he hopes to emerge renewed and rescue a world on fire. But fighting from his lowest means that Man-Thing can rise to his highest, especially with the unexpected help of the X-MEN’S resident sorceress MAGIK and her debuting team of monstrous mutants known as THE DARK RIDERS!"

The fight takes a different turn as soon as Ironheart notices von Bardas possesses a force field generator, which theTony Stark A.I.theorizes could be extremely dangerous if von Bardas decides to use it offensively. Riri proceeds to fly away from the base, and Lucia gives chase. Riri takes an abrupt turn and attempts to land a punch as von Bardas is coming closer, but she's knocked down by several energy blasts that hit her from behind. As soon as she stands back up, Ironheart notices she's surrounded by an army ofDoombotsthat proceed to gang up on her.\nAboard theS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier,Sharon Carteris informed of Williams' involvement in Latveria. She's taken aback by the young girl's willingness to participate in the conflict as well as her quickness to take action. Carter then requests her subordinate to inform theWorld Security Councilthey are at World War threat level orange.\nInsideTony Stark's personal laboratory at theStark Industrial ComplexinDover,New Jersey, the Tony Stark A.I. accompaniesFridayas she also observes the ensuing battle between Riri and the Doombots. She questions Riri's prudence, as well as A.I. Tony decision to allow her to go over her head. While Friday demands Tony to get Riri out of the warzone, he argues he's supposed to guide her, not choose for her. Meanwhile, Ironheart has taken flight to evade the robots. As the discussion between Friday and Tony becomes hostile,MJ Watsonenters the laboratory, prompting A.I. Tony to leave.\nIronheart manages to fight back against the Doombots by deploying repulsor granedes on her trail, but she's immediately blasted from behind and swarmed. Riri gets the robots off of her with a blast, and continues fending off the Doombots. Back in Dover, Friday begins to explain MJ the differences between her kind of A.I. and Tony's. She describes herself as pure self-replicating and self-learning coding, while Tony is not. The battle in Latveria continues, and Riri suggests using the same tactic she used when training with the army of remotely-controlledIron Man suits, but A.I. Tony shuts her down. Riri takes numerous punches, and Tony makes her pay attention to Lucia von Bardas, noticing that she has returned to the military base for repairs because she took a hit.\nFriday's explanation continues, as she tells MJ that neither she nor Tony have actual bodies, with their holograms being merely projections used for the comfort of the humans around them. Friday points out to MJ that her emotions are programs to relate to real humans like her, whereas Tony's emotions are his own. He's a human program with no body to temper himself, so he feels, but has nothing to feel with. MJ is surprised by this revelation and its potential ramifications, and asks if A.I. Tony should be unplugged. Friday rebukes the idea, stating that she simply wanted MJ to know what she's dealing with. MJ makes Friday concede that she's indeed worried, but for the time being he's doing good with Riri.\nIronheart finishes off the two final Doombots, making them crash with each other with a flight maneuver. Lucia von Bardas prepares to engage her again, demanding the ensuing fight to be recorded. Both Riri and von Bardas are about to confront each other when Ironheart's armor suddenly appears to malfunction and she plummets into the ground. Von Bardas approaches her as she lies in a crater and prepares to take off her faceplate. It turns out Riri faked it, and proceeds to blast von Bardas away with a powerful repulsor ray that knocks the villain into a truck.General Karadickattempts to retaliate with a machine gun after Riri stands up, but she swiftly knocks him down with another repulsor blast as she walks up to von Bardas. Before von Bardas can get her second wind, Ironheart punches her and demands she stands down. Indignant, von Barda berates Riri, claiming Williams' actions constitute an act of war, and states that she has no authority. In light of that, Ironheart proclaims her attack is an act of dethroning, and declares herself the new queen of Latveria.\n• Riri Williams strikes out on her own as her idealism is put to the test by a world she does not understand yet."

The threats of Nazi Gerany have been defeated. However, the world is still in peril, so a super-team has formed - the All-Winners Squad! We see them in action against a time-traveler called Future Man, who threatens to summon his army across time and conquer present-day Earth. However, a happy accident on the part of Captain America destroys his machinery, and Future Man, his paramour Madame Death, and his timeship, and sent careening through time.\nThe heroes escape, and are met by the press. Cap seems uncomfortable with them, since he is the second man to wear the mask but must pretend to be the first. Miss America deflects probing questions by setting ap up as the hero of the piece and implying a relationship between her and him.\nA week later, the All-Winners Squad is at their HQ in the Flatiron Building. They think that the current Captain will do well, but is being beaten by having to measure up to the original. Miss America and the Whizzer are going for a night out in their secret identities.\nAs they walk, the Whizzer says he is having trouble seperating Miss America's feelings for Captain America from Madeline's feelings for him. Miss America waves it away as part of the act, but the Whizzer is worried that one day, he won't be jealous any more.\nThe two meet a soldier, who kisses Madeline, then explains that he is returned from the Pacific. As he tells them about the horrors of the battlefield, he turns into a zombie, and starts exhibiting murderous PTSD, repeating \"You die, I live.\"\nMore zombies appear from exploions around Times Square, and the heroes rush to action. The Wizzer moves all the civilians to Rockefeller Plaza while the rest of the team fight the zombies. The Whizzer tries to help his teammates, but is stopped by a forcefield.\nWithin the forcefield, the All-Winners Squad is confronted by the original Captain America and Bucky. They explain that if they can find someone to take their place in the afterlife, they can return to life. The team is shocked by this, but the current Cap offers his life in exchange for his predecessor's.\nToro, however, is not so trusting, and sees a woman in the shadows. As he hits her, all the zombies stop moving at once. She is revealed as Madame Death. She explains that Future Man was able to use some of the ship's technology to prevent their fall through time, and then started rebuilding the ship. Over the course of a few years, he filled her in on certain parts of ghistory as he knew it - including the \"death\" of Steve Rogers. Contracting a fatal illness, Future Man died in the past, leaving Madame Death to return to the present and gain revenge.\nToro tries to destroy what he assumes is her qweapon, but she planned for this - it is the weapon, but it is both flameproof and heat-activated. As the device explodes, the forcefield breaks down. Cap shields Bucky, Human Torch and Toro melt the shrapnel before it hits them, and Sub-Mariner is naturlly shrapnel-proof... but Miss America is not so lucky... until the Whizzer saves her. Madame Death is killed by her own bomb, and dies thinking of her love.\nThe next day, the All-Winners Squad decide that they should move their headquarters to avoid future collateral damage. Cap mentions that he knows a new building which would be ideal, and whose owner made his money selling paper to the comics industry. They call a press conference to detract attention from reports of undead soldiers. One of the reporters mentions the alleged \"relationship\" between Miss America and Captain America, which leads Miss America to sweep the Whizzer off his feet and kiss him. Cap, no longer the centre of attention, thankfully slinks away. Namor catches up with him,. and commends him for his bravery, noting that such an act is worthy of the mantle of Captain America.\nThe stpry ends with Jeff Mace, the civilian identity of Captain America, writing a piece on the events of the week. On the desk in front of him is a letter fromLeland Baxter, saying that he would be proud to accept the All-Winners Squad into his newly-constructedBaxter Building.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nLocations:\nItems:\nSuddenly, Captain America and Bucky are ambushed by their old foe the Red Skull and an army of Nazis. They attempt to gun down the heroes, but they manage to escape and decide to investigate the town. Within the town, the Red Skull is furious that Captain America and Bucky got away as they stand in the way of his plan: As Germany is losing the war, the Red Skull has begun a plan to take over the United States and turn it into a Nazi country from within.\nCaptain America and Bucky arrive in the town and rescue a group of vacationers who are being held prisoner and getting them food giving them freedom from want. He tells the people there that as Americans they are entitled to freedom from fear. Tracking the Red Skull to the outside of a church, Captain America prevents him from destroying it, protecting the peoples freedom of religion. The Red Skull manages to knock out Cap and Bucky and they are then taken to a local pool that has been drained and attempts to toss them into it from the diving board.\nhttp://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12432"

Meanwhile, the super-evolved inhabitants of the city prepare to defend themselves - also with the help of a Reed Richards.\nIn New York, the Future Foundation is preparing to depart for the battlefield. In this calm, Sue Richards corners Nathaniel and makes it clear that she does not like part in events to date. When Reed comes come in to break them up, Nathaniel gets him to admit that it was the actions of Reed and Valeria that brought them to this point. When Sue accuses him of acting like a soldier, he says that if the Council succeeds in their plan, the planet will dissolve into chunks, and what follows it will be even worse. He departs, and Reed orders Sue to rest from her recent concussion while everyone else goes to save the day.\nAt the city, Doctor Doom performs a magic to protect them from the effects in the city, and the group splits up to cover specific tasks. The High Evolutionary goes to shut down the engine at the heart of the lost city, while everyone else splits off into squads of two or three. Spider-Man worries that the villains need to be watched, but Reed brushes this off, pointing out the math is unassailable - one of the villainswillbetray them if given the chance, so considering the stakes, why worry?\nBack in New York, Valeria tries to break out of her room, but her father's programming turns out to be superior to hers. Frustrated, she is surprised by an area of the wall being cut out by a blowtorch wielded by her big brother.\nBack at the city, Reed, Nathaniel and Spider-Man have formed a secure zone using barricades made of webbing. Reed finally gets sight of one of the Reeds - his counterpart from Earth-4280, who lacks the creative spark of the other Reeds. Worrying about a stitch-up, he is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Medusa and Lockjaw, who teleport down from Attilan to find Reed. Catching him, they teleport back up.\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the city, Doctor Doom, Diablo and the Mad Thinker come across a pair of the Reeds. They demands answers, but the man they ask seems clueless. Suddenly, Doom is struck from behind. It seems that Diablo and the Mad Thinker have their own theories about how the fight should go..."

Reed, the Torch, and the Thing defeat the Mad Thinker--without Sue, who’s at home with Franklin, making dinner. Klaw tries to blackmail Ghana into leasing him its diamond mines until the Black Panther buys him off with a generous cache of Vibranium and tells him never to set foot on the African continent again. Captain America fights the Vietnam War--helping Vietnamese people who are being abused by American troops. The Sub-Mariner surfaces in Florida--and hangs out at a public library. Sue tries to campaign for the ERA, but Reed complains that being alone with Franklin is taking valuable time from his work on the Galactus problem and insists she come home. Reed’s obsession with Galactus and his friendship with Victor Von Doom both deepen. Von Doom is becoming an influence as unhealthy as Reed’s persistent visions of worlds being annihilated by the planet-killer. And it’s only going to get worse.\nAfter Sue and Johnny have a brother/sister bonding moment, Johnny mentions the “thing” that the world’s heroes are attending the next day--to which Sue has not been invited. After angrily confronting Reed about the “meeting of heroes” that he didn’t tell her about, Sue goes to Johnny’s place, where she meets Captain America, the Black Panther--and the Sub-Mariner. Just as he did in our world, Prince Namor finds himself instantly attracted to Sue. He personally encourages her to join them at the United Nations, where they will speak to the General Assembly about the state of the world and what super-people can do about it. Sue tells Namor that she thinks of herself mostly as a Mom. But later, at a book signing by Betty Friedan, the feminist author signs Sue’s copy of The Feminine Mystique with, “Don’t stay invisible forever”--which brings all of our heroine’s conflicted feelings to a head.\nSue is present at the UN along with Johnny, the Panther, and the other heroes. At the same time, at Reed’s lab, Reed and Von Doom have finished their construction of a powered suit of armor that Von Doom declares they will use to attack the UN and the heroes gathered there. Reed suddenly realizes that his “friend” from Latveria has been using him all this time, but it’s too late. Now fully emerged as Dr. Doom, Victor blasts Reed and heads for the fateful meeting. By the time Reed has caught up with him, Doom has blasted his way into the UN and immobilized all the heroes--except one. The Invisible Girl has cloaked herself and grabbed Captain America’s shield, and now uses it to tackle Dr. Doom, bringing him down single-handedly, saving the UN and all the champions of humanity.\nMr. Fantastic is humbled before the world by his own wife. Sue leaves him, takes a resentful Franklin--and moves in with the Sub-Mariner. Reed gets an urgent message from the Arecibo Observatory that “something big” is heading right for Earth."

After getting on the plane, two passengers recognize him as Captain America.\nIn the past, Sam, as Captain America, is flying around ahelicarrierevadingHydraforces whileMisty Knightprotects an innocent scientist from their grasp.Dennis Dunphyis also helping Cap by trying to hijack the aircraft and landing. After reminding his allies to stay alert, Cap is ironically caught off-guard byCrossbones, Hydra's muscle in the operation Wilson is trying to thwart. It's revealed the scientist Sam is trying to rescue is aS.H.I.E.L.D.top scientist who had been lured to an officially decommissioned helicarrier by Hydra, with numerous of their soldiers posing as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to create an atmosphere of false security for the scientist to work with no problems or need to use force. Cap and Crossbones proceed to fight one-on-one.\nBack in the present, Wilson's co-passengers are bombarding him with questions, primarily wondering why isn't he flying on aQuinjetor any mean other than commercial flight. When the passengers try to get the attention of a flight attendant and tell her about Cap's presence, she acts indifferent.\nSwitching to the the aftermath of Cap's fight on board the helicarrier, he brings Crossbones handcuffed to the feet of S.H.I.E.L.D. DirectorMaria Hill, who receives Wilson with indifference. After Crossbones is taken to custody, Wilson informs Hill that it appears S.H.I.E.L.D. is completely Hydra-free for once, adding that Hydra is having problems with rebuilding their ranks. Hill continues acting Sam with disregard, as he no longer works for S.H.I.E.L.D. or the government.\nSam recalls his past as the partner of the previous Captain America,Steve Rogers, and how he wanted to simply follow his footsteps after succeeding him. However, he feels theUnited States of Americaare as divided as it's ever been. People in opposite ideologies are more aggressive towards each other, inequality is soaring, and certain \"good\" agencies are each day more morally dubious. And the part that scares Sam the most is that he too has a political side, opinions and beliefs. While Steve didn't get involved in politics if it wasn't necessary, Sam decided that Captain America needed to be more than a symbol, and that he should step into the fray and make the change happen. However, his announcement brought Sam a wave of criticism and detractors, transforming Captain America ino a politically dividing figure.\nIn order to work closely to the people, he established a hotline. Most of the calls were for trivial matters, except one which caught Sam's attention. A Mexican immigrant namedMariana Torreswhose grandson disappeared. Her grandson,Joaquin, was a good Samaritan, accused of being acoyotefor leaving supplies in theSonoran Desertfor immigrants. The local authorities suspected he had merely died or had gotten lost in the desert, but Mariana believed he had been kidnapped by theSons of the Serpent.\nSam tried to get Dennis to charter a jet toArizona, but their finances prevented doing so. Sam had to resort to seeking assistance from his brotherGideon, who agreed to help fund him, but couldn't help him beyond that, which forced Sam to ultimately take a commercial flight.\nIn the desert, a group of immigrants were sustaining the harshness of the sun until they found the water Joaquin had left. Their leader told them they would get a new life, but they are stopped by the Son of the Serpents, who try to force the group to come with them or die. Just then Captain America confronted them, with the Supreme Serpent pointing out that he and theAvengersare also vigilantes. Sam says that he will have to learn to live with that and fights them off with the help ofRedwing. After dealing with them, a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet descends, and Commander Steve Rogers emerges, ordering Sam to stand down."

Among them are Lindy Nolen and Tre Owens. They try contacting Worldmind to inform him of their situation. Just as Warstar is about to destroy them, his heads are blasted off by Richard Rider, who had reclaimed his title as Nova Prime. He then destroys the Shi'ar destroyerIonclad, before returning the Centurions to Nu-Xandar; Lindy is more surprised to see that Worldmind is a she now. He urges them to return to Earth and live normal lives, but Tre and Lindy insist on staying.\nRider then goes to Irani to ask where his brother Robbie is. The Rigellian informs him that Robbie and Qubit had left for the Kree colony of Nil-Rast, where Cohort 86 had been killed in action. Rider takes both Irani and Morrow to find Robbie. As they approach Nil-Rast, Worldmind reminds Rider then this is the place whee Gamora killed her template: Ko-Rel. Rider reminds her that though she talks like Ko-Rel, she isn't her.\nUpon arriving on the surface, the Centurions are attacked by the Kree and Inhumans, who use echo-weapons. Rider calls out that they are on a peacekeeping mission, but the Inhumans consider their arrival an act of aggression. Among the charging Inhumans is Triton, whom Rider refuses to fight. Luckily, Ra-Venn, a veteran of the Phalanx Conquest, calls for everyone to stand down, personally vouching for Rider. Showing Rider to the infirmary, they find Qubit. When asked as to where Robbie, Qubit could not provide an answer. Triton then shows Rider the pile of Centurion helmets.\nMeanwhile, the Shi'ar assault the ceded Kree homeworld of Kree-Lar, home to Ravenous' forces. In his own palace, Ravenous tells his advisor Orbus that Vulcan could've made an alliance against the Kree with him. Instead, he wants to simply conquer Kree-Lar. Orbus assures Ravenous that they will push back the Shiar and adds that Vulcan is overstretching the Shi'ar's resources to annex the ceded territories as well as the Kree.\nThen suddenly, an extremely fast object strikes Ravenous and kills Orbus. The object is in fact Xenith, who was sent by Vulcan to assassinate Ravenous to demoralize his forces. Ravenous attempts to fight back but is no match for the Strontian. Then suddenly, Xenith is pinned down by a gravimetric beam, emanating from Robbie, who declares that Ravenous is under his protection and she is under arrest.\nEvents:\n| Solicit                 = \nA WAR OF KINGS TIE-IN!

He asks if the Avengers can get inside, and Eden says he can.\nInside, the Avengers and the Canadian liaison find the ruins of Regina completely covered with alien vegetation and fauna. Small yellow creatures speaking the Builders’ language guide them to a glowing pool where they find a transformed Validator, who says something in the Builders’ language and teleports them outside of the alien zone. The Canadian liaison asks Captain America if he saw it too, and whether anyone can force him to reveal what he saw. Cap says no. The liaison says he has an implanted visual recorder that will be reviewed by Dept H, and once they see it, they will ask questions. He then commits suicide.\nLater, after the Avengers have left claiming to remember nothing, Maria Hill says that an additional 327 hours of footage was found on the liaison’s recording device, not just from the present mission but from the past and future as well. They realize that Validator told him something.\nFlying home, the Avengers are silent; each contemplating how they themselves were altered and transformed (or ripped into and out of time) within the alien zone. Eden asks why the liaison killed himself; Wolverine says that Validator was his daughter, and whatever secret she told him he wanted to protect with his life.\nWe learn that she told him that “the system is now online.”\n\"VALIDATOR\"\n• We learn that the Canadian super team Omega Flight got lost in a Garden Origin Site.\n• Discover what happens when the Avengers go in to rescue them."

Doom doesn't help the situation by mocking Ben for watching helplessly while the Human Torch sacrificed his life to stop an invasion from the Negative Zone. The two are about to come to blows, but the Invisible Woman interrupts, telling them not to fight in the house. Valeria and Nathaniel explain that Doom is integral to their plans and they need to keep their friends close and their enemies closer. Ben has had enough and drags Dragon Man out with him to find the nearest bar. Reed tells Sue to go with them to try to make Ben understand why the need Doom's help. Sue doesn't like the situation any more than Ben does, but concedes, hoping that her husband knows what he is doing.\nMister Fantastic takes Spider-Man and Doctor Doom into the \"Room\" where the children of the Future Foundation use their minds to come up with solutions to their problems. Putting her mind to it, Valeria comes up with a solution: repair Doctor Doom's mind with a back-up copy. After some pressing, Doom agrees to take them to Kristoff Vernard. Meanwhile, at Muk's Bar, Sue tries to talk some sense into Ben about having Doom on the team. After hearing how Dragon Man is now a pacifist, Sue tells the Thing that they need to find their place in this new world that they are creating for themselves.\nThe following day, Mister Fantastic, his father, Valeria, Doctor Doom and Spider-Man arrive in Latveria, where Doom presents himself to Kristoff who has assumed the throne since Doom's brain has been damaged. Doom recounts how when Kristoff's mother was murdered, Doom took the boy as his ward and groomed him to become his successor. During a period in which Doom was believed to be dead, Kristoff had his mind programmed with Doom's memories. They soon begin building a machine that will allow them to transfer the missing portions of Doom's from Kristoff's brain. After they prepare to begin the experiment, Reed briefly considers purging Doom's mind instead of healing it, but decides against it. Although the device explodes, the experiment is a success and Doom's mind is restored to normal. Doom then explains that now that his mind has been restored, he will now live up to his end of the bargain he made with Valeria. When Reed asks what he means, Doom tells them that they were going to work together to defeat Reed Richards."

Stolen fromClan Akkabaat birth, he and his sister,Eimin, were raised and abused by the fiendish time tyrantKang the Conqueror.[4][5]In adulthood, they hatched a plan to betray Kang and destroy his empire. They attempted to manipuate theCelestialsinto destroying theEarth, killing allhumans, and also erasing all of Earth's futures while they would savemutantkindon theirArkto bring them toparadise.[6]However, they were outmaneuvered by Kang, hisChronos Corps, and theAvengers Unity Divisionand were killed.[7]\nUriel as a newborn infant\nUriel andEiminwere born from the union of theFinal HorsemanIchisumiandArchangel. The twins were conceived after Archangel's ascension to become thenew Apocalypseand the leader of theClan Akkaba.[8]The much anticipated twins were born inAkkaba Cityunder theNorth Pole. Although the pair was highly guarded by the Clan Akkaba and the Horsemen, the twins were soon abducted byKang the Conqueror. Kang took the pair into thetimestreamwith plans to use them for his own purposes.[4]\nKang adopted the twins as his own children and brought them toEarth-13044. There they were raised in concentration camps, constantly fearing recruitment byAhabto becomeHounds.[9]\nThe adolescentApocalypse TwinsalongsideKang the Conqueror\nDuring their adolescences, Kang brought the twins from concentration camps to his palace in the year 4145 AD. The twins were then dispatched on a mission to murderColonel America. However, their mission failed, though the twins did successfully murderHavokandRogue, the first lives they ever took. As punishment for their failure, the twins were sent back to the concentration camps.[10]\nThe Twins reappeared in the modern era, whenGenocide, son ofApocalypse, contacted aCelestial Gardener. He hoped to receive theDeath Seedand replace Apocalypse as Archangel had. As the Gardener judged his worth, Uriel and Eimin appeared. Using the axeJarnbjorn, Uriel killed the Gardener. Together, he and Eimin defeated Genocide's forces. They then attackedthe Peak.[11]They next travelled withThorandSunfiretoAkkaba City. Seeing how most ofClan Akkabawasdepowered, they killed most of them and destroyed the city.[9]The Twins usedLife SeedsandDeath Seedsharvested from the Gardener to resurrectSentry,Banshee,Grim Reaper, andDakenas theFour Horsemen of Death.[12]\nThe appearance of theApocalypse Twins\nThe Twins framed the Earth for the death of the Celestial Gardener so thatExitar the Executionerwould arrive to the planet and destroy it.[13]This was part of their vengeance against their father as they wanted to eliminate the Earth and all of its futures, thus erasing Kang's kingdom.[14]Thanks to their Tachyon Dam, neither Kang norImmortuscould travel to the past to stop the Twins.[12][14]The Apocalypse Twins convinced theScarlet Witchto cast a spell in order to bring everymutantto theirArkto ensure the survival of mutantkind while humanity died with the Earth, so that mutants could live in paradise onPlanet X.[15][16]\nUriel using his wings to fly and releasing his energy razors\nUriel is amutantand has demonstrated the following powers:\nUriel'sChronokinesis"

Covering the story for the Daily Bugle is veteran reporter Betty Brant. Arguing against the Fantastic Four is chief prosecutor Aiden Toliver. The case is off to a rough start when Toliver asks Reed Richards about the first time he used the Fantasti-Flare to summon the Fantastic Four. As there was no immediate threat, Aiden points out how the fledgling Fantastic Four counted a great deal of property damage, including the destruction of military aircraft at the hands of the Human Torch.\nNext, Tolvier calls the Thing to the stand to talk about one of the Thing's early battles against the Hulk. Although She-Hulk, who is defending the Fantastic Four, points out that her cousin is now an authorized agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and that the Avengers were also involved in the clash which Tolvier mentions, he still is allowed to question about this incident. Aiden points out how the Thing continued to antagonize the Hulk and cause countless millions of dollars in property damage provoking further battle when the Hulk was clearly trying to get away. Next Toliver calls the Invisible Woman to the stand and brings up the Fantastic Four's relationship with the Sub-Mariner, mentioning his many attacks on New York City. He also points out how the Fantastic Four has never worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. or another agency to trap him once and for all, something that the people of Wakanda would have appreciated now.\nJohnny Storm is called up next and his past relationship with Crystal of the Inhuman Royal Family is brought up. He mentions the damage caused to New York during the Fantastic Four's first encounter with the Inhumans, their long association and the recent destruction of Attilan that could have been prevented had Johnny shared what he knew with various intelligence agencies. Mister Fantastic is called to the stand again, and he is questioned of his long history with Doctor Doom. Pointing out that regardless of the many times that the Fantastic Four fought Doctor Doom, even terrorizing his Reed and Sue's children in the process, he allowed his daughter Valeria to run off to Latveria to be with that same foe. After a lunch break, the trial resumes and Aiden Toliver brings up the Fantastic Four's first encounter with Galactus. How Galactus was defeated with the Ultimate Nullifier. When Tolvier asked where the Nullifier went, Reed said he doesn't entirely know. This leads to the admission that at one time Reed had the Nullifier in the Baxter Building. This leads to Reed also admitting to having a portal to the Negative Zone, also in the Baxter Building, That the Negative Zone is where invaders such as Blastaar and Annihilus comes from. He also gets Reed to admit that he has other portals to other dimensions, like the one where the most recent invaders came from.\nNext. the Invisible Woman is brought back to the stand to talk about how she was once turned into Malice by the Hate-Monger. Toliver next brings a witness to the stand who testifies that his father's career as a cab driver was ruined thanks to one of the Thing's temper tantrums and that they have never been able to recoup money for the loss because of all the other lawsuits file against the Fantastic Four. In his closing arguments, Toliver points out that the Fantastic Four have saved the city and the world many times over, they are responsible for years of careless and reckless behavior. The Fantastic Four soon lose their case, and although the She-Hulk is planning on filing an appeal, this has done nothing to stop the courts from seizing the children of the Future Foundation.\nMeanwhile, in Italy, Doctor Doom is trying heroics for the first time by liberating the town of Puglia from the tyranny of Count Neferia. When Valeria suggests they do something about famine ravaged reasons in Somalia, Doctor Doom notices that there is something wrong with her. She admits that she misses her brother Franklin and hopes that he is okay. At that very moment at S.H.I.E.L.D. Base 4201 (formally Camp Hammond), the children of the Future Foundation are offloaded from an aircraft. When the soldiers there tell Alex Power that he has to go, as he is not a minor and his parents have requested his return, Alex refuses to go. The situation gets tense when the man in charge arrives. As it turns out it is Jim Hammond, the original android Human Torch. Upon seeing this legend from World War II, Alex assures the children that they will be okay here.\n“THE FALL OF THE FANTASTIC FOUR” PART 5 - Super-Sized issue!\n• The Baxter Building is quarantined and shut down!\n• The Fantastic Four held accountable for the destruction in Manhattan!\n• A major turning point for the team and a dire blow to the family!"

Anna Maria thinks he's joking but then sees that \"Peter\" is missing, not realizing he just jumped into action as Spider-Man. While he's seeking Lamaze, he's called by hisSpiderlingsabout Stunner's attack in thecity. Otto decides to confront her personally and once he arrives, he gets a full assault from her, and Stunner screams her motives: to avenge the death of her beloved Otto Octavius (since she doesn't know that Otto is now inhabitingSpider-Man's body). Meanwhile, at Potter's Field,Carlie Coopervisits the tomb of Otto Octavius, now knowing the full truth about the mindswitch, and reminisces about how Peter died as a hero but no one knew. Suddenly, the ground crumbles underneath her, revealing that the body is missing and she is then kidnapped by agreen-skinned assailant.\nStunner's assault against Spider-Man continues, with Otto trying to talk her out of attacking but she refuses to listen, bent on making her revenge complete, forcing Otto to wrap her in his new enhanced spider-web, buying some time to send his Spiderbots to track the source of Stunner's VR Interface and shut it down, although once Otto leaves, she easily escapes. Otto returns to E.S.U. to find Lamaze, who is talking with Anna Maria. Otto adjusts his earpiece to listen in on their conversation, hearing Anna Maria determined to convince Lamaze that \"Peter\" is not doing anything wrong and is one of the smartest men she ever knew, making Otto discover how much she understands him. Suddenly his Spider-Sense alerts him of a bus flying by after it was launched by Stunner, heading straight into Lamaze and Anna Maria, but Otto catches it with a thick layer of his Spider-Web in time to save them, which unfortunately leaves him open to Stunner's assault, who goes as far as tearing his mechanical legs apart. Stunner attacks Spider-Man, wanting him to beg for mercy and avenge Otto's death, but in the nick of time, theSpiderbotsmanage to shut down Angelina's interface.\nAfter the attack, Otto arrives to the secret lab, finding Angelina unconscious, managing to take away her Virtual Reality System. Once she wakes up, she is shocked to see Otto Octavius in person, just the way she knew him, not realizing that Otto is using the same method of Stunner by making his own \"Doctor Octopus\" avatar, however, Otto tells Angelina that he moved on while she was in a coma, but he'll always care for her. Afterwards, Otto visits Lamaze, who the next day drops all his accusations against \"Peter\". After they leave, Lamaze reveals to \"Peter\" that Otto Octavius visited him and revealed that it was \"Peter\" who gave Otto all the ideas for his inventions. \"Peter\" asks him to keep it a secret to avoid hurting Otto's ego, and Lamaze and Anna Maria congratulate him for his earned doctorate.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:"

A very dark secret. NORMAN OSBORN IS ALIVE. They are currently holding him in a very secret containment facility. Two guards walk in to watch him and move him to another location is S.H.I.E.L.D.'s absence. One of them even punches him in the face. All he says is, \"Yri gna brn\", which means \"You're gonna burn\".\nMeanwhile, two guys discuss whether or not Captain America is alive, when all of a sudden two guys called the \"Spider-Twins\" barge in and attack them. They beat the guys up, kick them to death, and rob them.\nAt school, Miles can't stop worrying about his dad. Jefferson has pretty much abandoned Miles after he discovered his identity. This has prompted Miles to launch countless things such as Google Alerts, but there is no sign of him. The only thing keeping him sane is Katie Bishop, as his relationship with her is getting extremely serious, much to Ganke being unintentionally ignored. Miles also is struggling with revealing his identity to Katie. When the teacher walks in, she says that no one cares about Jefferson at this moment in time, making Miles furious. As this happens, Osborn is being transported in a police car, when he suddenly unleashes his goblin powers, destroying the highway and allowing him to roam free.\nWhile Miles and Ganke hang out, Miles texts MJ, saying he really wants to reveal his identity to Katie but doesn't know how. The two meet up with each other, and MJ said that knowing Peter's identity came with risks, but that he has to stay true to Katie. She warns him, however, that if Katie is told of Miles' identity, they will never truly go their separate ways, as MJ will always love Peter no matter what, and vice versa until his untimely end... or was it?\nFor when Miles goes home wondering about the Spider-Twins, there stands a teenager rummaging through Miles' stuff to claim some of his own and resume his costumed identity.\nAND THAT TEENAGER IS PETER PARKER.\nPART ONE OF THE BIGGEST SPIDER-MAN STORY OF THE YEAR “REVIVAL”!\n• MILES is back in action with a new status quo and a new outlook on life!\n• A BIG BIG BIG villain from PETER PARKER’s past is alive and well and about to turn New York upside down!\n• The last page will have ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN fans SCREAMING!"

Thanos, wrought with despair from his defeat, is ready to accept whichever fate Mephisto decides for him, but is unexpectedly rescued by a spectre of his future self wielding the Infinity Gauntlet. The spectre explains that the future Thanos saw his inevitable defeat through the Time Gem and created several avatars to explore his past and future to solve certain mysteries, including the lost memory of how he recovered from his first defeat. He realizes that it was his own interference in his history that prevented himself from being enslaved by Mephisto at that moment, and that when Nebula uses the Gauntlet to reset the timeline, Thanos will only retain the subconscious effects of their atemporal encounter. The avatar then leads Thanos on a tour through significant events in his future:Infinity Gauntlet,Infinity Watch,Infinity War,Infinity Crusade,Infinity Abyss, ultimately building up to theInfinity Revelation. They reach a barrier in the Gem's ability to see through time, apparently not as a limitation of the Time Gem, but of time itself.

Upon finding his corpse, Nick Fury began an investigation along with the Avengers. Meanwhile, a parallel investigation was carried out by Ant-Man, Punisher, Doctor Strange, Emma Frost, Moon Knight, Black Panther, Winter Soldier and Gamora, who were gathered by a mysterious boss.[1]\nNick Fury's investigation led the heroes to theOrb, who had acquired one of Uatu's eyes with the help ofExterminatrixandDoctor Midas, but claimed not to be the killer. The other investigation unveiled a hidden trace of bodies of monsters left by whomever killed the Watcher, using gamma-irradiated bullets. When the Nick Fury, the Avengers and numerous other heroes raided the Orb's base, the villain activated Uatu's eye, which unleashed a wave of energy,[2]said energy emanation caused anyone within its short range to suddenly discover deep secrets related to them.\nThe Orb was taken into custody and interrogated while Exterminatrix and Midas escaped. In the meantime, the Winter Soldier, Moon Knight and Gamora discovered the corpse of anEgo-like living planet, killed by the same type of gamma-irradiated bullets as the Watcher. In a turn of events, Bucky left Moon Knight and Gamora stranded in the dead planet by exploding their spaceship before teleporting away. Winter Soldier's destination was the Avengers Tower, where Nick Fury was questioning why the wave of energy didn't cause him to discover any secret, and who could have the second eye of the Watcher. Bucky mercilessly killed Nick Fury and took the eye of Uatu he had seized from the Orb as he stated there would be no more secrets.[3]\nDoctor Strange and Punisher's investigation took them to another realm, where they discovered somebody had been killing monsters. Realizing that the killer had been doing that for a long time, Strange concluded that someone already knew about this, and merely sent him and Punisher to pick up his trail. Black Panther, Ant-Man and Emma Frost were returning from having discovered numerous underground monsters killed with gamma-irradiated bullets as they received the alert that Nick Fury had been killed, believing that couldn't be right, he deviated their shuttle's trajectory. As Wolverine and Hulk discovered Fury's corpse, Doctor Strange and Punisher arrived at the Tower, incapacitating the Avengers and taking the Orb with them, who Strange detected as being useful for the investigation, as he could lead them to Uatu's eye.\nBlack Panther's team arrived to a hidden satellite, from where the same signal which contacted him for the investigation came from. They met Punisher and Doctor Strange there, as well as Bucky. As the Winter Soldier was explaining why was he there, Gamora and Moon Knight arrived to the base, having being rescued from the dead planet by Rocket Raccoon. As Gamora fought Bucky, the head of Nick Fury the Winter Soldier was holding was revealed to be a LMD's. Bucky revealed he had tracked down the signal of the LMD's chip to the satellite. As Emma Frost was questioning Black Panther whether they were actually working for Nick Fury or not, an elder Nick Fury revealed himself, accompanied by other LMDs of him.[4]\nIn order to give an explanation, Nick Fury told the heroes a story about his past. During a mission in Kansas, Fury found himself trying to fight off the aliens known as Tribellians. His forces were overpowered, but the tables were turned onceWoody McCordarrived and defeated the monsters before being fatally injured.Howard Stark, McCord's partner, arrived to the scene and discovered Fury alongside Woody's corpse. He decided to show Fury the work McCord had been doing as defender of Earth, the Man on the Wall, neutralizing any potential threat for the planet, and offered him Woody's job. Fury accepted and over the next years would secretly fight different super human threats, from aliens to Subterranean monsters and extra-dimensional beings, and those had been the corpses the different parties had found.\nBefore he could answer other questions, the Orb collapsed in the floor. Fury stated that his body was still absorbing what he stole from the Moon, and that they had to put him in the interrogation room as the clock was ticking. When Black Panther asked what happened to the Watcher, Fury replied merely that he had died, but also that he now supposed it was his turn.[5]\nMeanwhile, the Exterminatrix and Midas travelled to a certain location from which he activated a hidden vessel to go back to the Moon. Back to the satellite, Fury explained the heroes that because he now lacked the Infinity Formula in his blood, he was rapidly aging and was going to die. Fury had carefully chosen those heroes to follow his trail, as he wanted one of them to be his replacement. At the Avengers Tower, Iron Man was examining the corpse of the LMD killed by the Winter Soldier, and before it self-destructed as a self-defense mechanism, Stark managed to get the location to where the LMD had sent a signal. When Fury received the alert that the LMD had self-destructed and concluded that he would soon be discovered, he took one of the Watcher's eyes from Bucky and enclosed himself in a secure room, as he tried to activate the second eye he had all this time. When the Avengers arrived to the satellite, Fury confronted the heroes, equipped with armor while holding the two eyes of the Watcher, claiming that his eyes had been opened.[6]\nThe Avengers failed to stop Nick Fury, who arrived to Uatu's citadel at the same time theOrb(who had escaped Fury's custody), andDoctor Midasdid.[7]\nFury confronted Doctor Midas, who was trying to acquire more power than he had before when he attacked the citadel. Fury fought Midas' Mindless Ones, during which one of the Watcher's eyes was taken from him by the Orb, and was almost defeated until the heroes chosen by Fury arrived and also managed to get a confession from him that he was the one who had killed Uatu and took the second eye. Fury had done this because when he went to aid Uatu as soon as he had been attacked and robbed by the Orb and Doctor Midas, the Watcher refused to tell him the names of the culprits, at it was against his oath of non-interference. Fury had realized the eyes were where Uatu kept what he had seen, and that the only way to know the identities of the criminals before they did something with Uatu's armory was to have one of them, for which he had killed Uatu and took the remaining eye.\nFury then confronted Midas, who was becoming more powerful by absorbing the powers from Uatu's corpse. By forcing Midas to absorb the power of the Watcher's eye he had left, Fury overloaded him and killed the villain in an explosion, which also seemingly killed Fury.\nWalk the Road to Original Sin"

Upon finding his corpse, Nick Fury began an investigation along with the Avengers. Meanwhile, a parallel investigation was carried out by Ant-Man, Punisher, Doctor Strange, Emma Frost, Moon Knight, Black Panther, Winter Soldier and Gamora, who were gathered by a mysterious boss.[1]\nNick Fury's investigation led the heroes to theOrb, who had acquired one of Uatu's eyes with the help ofExterminatrixandDoctor Midas, but claimed not to be the killer. The other investigation unveiled a hidden trace of bodies of monsters left by whomever killed the Watcher, using gamma-irradiated bullets. When the Nick Fury, the Avengers and numerous other heroes raided the Orb's base, the villain activated Uatu's eye, which unleashed a wave of energy,[2]said energy emanation caused anyone within its short range to suddenly discover deep secrets related to them.\nThe Orb was taken into custody and interrogated while Exterminatrix and Midas escaped. In the meantime, the Winter Soldier, Moon Knight and Gamora discovered the corpse of anEgo-like living planet, killed by the same type of gamma-irradiated bullets as the Watcher. In a turn of events, Bucky left Moon Knight and Gamora stranded in the dead planet by exploding their spaceship before teleporting away. Winter Soldier's destination was the Avengers Tower, where Nick Fury was questioning why the wave of energy didn't cause him to discover any secret, and who could have the second eye of the Watcher. Bucky mercilessly killed Nick Fury and took the eye of Uatu he had seized from the Orb as he stated there would be no more secrets.[3]\nDoctor Strange and Punisher's investigation took them to another realm, where they discovered somebody had been killing monsters. Realizing that the killer had been doing that for a long time, Strange concluded that someone already knew about this, and merely sent him and Punisher to pick up his trail. Black Panther, Ant-Man and Emma Frost were returning from having discovered numerous underground monsters killed with gamma-irradiated bullets as they received the alert that Nick Fury had been killed, believing that couldn't be right, he deviated their shuttle's trajectory. As Wolverine and Hulk discovered Fury's corpse, Doctor Strange and Punisher arrived at the Tower, incapacitating the Avengers and taking the Orb with them, who Strange detected as being useful for the investigation, as he could lead them to Uatu's eye.\nBlack Panther's team arrived to a hidden satellite, from where the same signal which contacted him for the investigation came from. They met Punisher and Doctor Strange there, as well as Bucky. As the Winter Soldier was explaining why was he there, Gamora and Moon Knight arrived to the base, having being rescued from the dead planet by Rocket Raccoon. As Gamora fought Bucky, the head of Nick Fury the Winter Soldier was holding was revealed to be a LMD's. Bucky revealed he had tracked down the signal of the LMD's chip to the satellite. As Emma Frost was questioning Black Panther whether they were actually working for Nick Fury or not, an elder Nick Fury revealed himself, accompanied by other LMDs of him.[4]\nIn order to give an explanation, Nick Fury told the heroes a story about his past. During a mission in Kansas, Fury found himself trying to fight off the aliens known as Tribellians. His forces were overpowered, but the tables were turned onceWoody McCordarrived and defeated the monsters before being fatally injured.Howard Stark, McCord's partner, arrived to the scene and discovered Fury alongside Woody's corpse. He decided to show Fury the work McCord had been doing as defender of Earth, the Man on the Wall, neutralizing any potential threat for the planet, and offered him Woody's job. Fury accepted and over the next years would secretly fight different super human threats, from aliens to Subterranean monsters and extra-dimensional beings, and those had been the corpses the different parties had found.\nBefore he could answer other questions, the Orb collapsed in the floor. Fury stated that his body was still absorbing what he stole from the Moon, and that they had to put him in the interrogation room as the clock was ticking. When Black Panther asked what happened to the Watcher, Fury replied merely that he had died, but also that he now supposed it was his turn.[5]\nMeanwhile, the Exterminatrix and Midas travelled to a certain location from which he activated a hidden vessel to go back to the Moon. Back to the satellite, Fury explained the heroes that because he now lacked the Infinity Formula in his blood, he was rapidly aging and was going to die. Fury had carefully chosen those heroes to follow his trail, as he wanted one of them to be his replacement. At the Avengers Tower, Iron Man was examining the corpse of the LMD killed by the Winter Soldier, and before it self-destructed as a self-defense mechanism, Stark managed to get the location to where the LMD had sent a signal. When Fury received the alert that the LMD had self-destructed and concluded that he would soon be discovered, he took one of the Watcher's eyes from Bucky and enclosed himself in a secure room, as he tried to activate the second eye he had all this time. When the Avengers arrived to the satellite, Fury confronted the heroes, equipped with armor while holding the two eyes of the Watcher, claiming that his eyes had been opened.[6]\nThe Avengers failed to stop Nick Fury, who arrived to Uatu's citadel at the same time theOrb(who had escaped Fury's custody), andDoctor Midasdid.[7]\nFury confronted Doctor Midas, who was trying to acquire more power than he had before when he attacked the citadel. Fury fought Midas' Mindless Ones, during which one of the Watcher's eyes was taken from him by the Orb, and was almost defeated until the heroes chosen by Fury arrived and also managed to get a confession from him that he was the one who had killed Uatu and took the second eye. Fury had done this because when he went to aid Uatu as soon as he had been attacked and robbed by the Orb and Doctor Midas, the Watcher refused to tell him the names of the culprits, at it was against his oath of non-interference. Fury had realized the eyes were where Uatu kept what he had seen, and that the only way to know the identities of the criminals before they did something with Uatu's armory was to have one of them, for which he had killed Uatu and took the remaining eye.\nFury then confronted Midas, who was becoming more powerful by absorbing the powers from Uatu's corpse. By forcing Midas to absorb the power of the Watcher's eye he had left, Fury overloaded him and killed the villain in an explosion, which also seemingly killed Fury.\nWalk the Road to Original Sin"

To make matters worse, Angie Huang informs her that the Latverian Franc's that Kristoff paid her in were confiscated by the bank due to the fact that they are considered illegal tender. It's then that Jennifer decides to take some time off and get some legal advice from another lawyer. Jennifer flies to San Francisco to get advice from Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil. He takes her to the top of the Golden Gate Bridge to see the sights. He explains that this wide open space is like heaven for his radar senses. However, he admits that he misses New York, his life had taken a strange turn for the better after he was disbarred when his identity was revealed. Jen gets down to business and explains how her attempt to get Kristoff asylum went and asks if she should go to Latveria and liberate him. Matt relates to how he recently represented Felicia Hardy on a murder trial as Matt Murdock. However, as Daredevil he helped Spider-Man break into Ryker's Prison and get the evidence needed to clear Felicia's name. Ultimately, Matt tells her, that she has to determine if she wants to go because for the benefit of Kristoff, or for herself. After going on patrol with Daredevil, She-Hulk thanks him for his advice.\nInstead of flying back to New York, Jennifer travels to Latveria instead. Once she arrives in the country she waits until nightfall to try and break Kristoff out of Castle Doom. Smashing her way into the castle she is opposed by an army of Doombots and easily trounces them. When the reinforcements begin flying in, she uses a mortar cannon to blast them out of the sky. By this point, Doctor Doom is aware of her presence and confronts her in a massive suit of robotic armor. Caught in the She-Hulk's grasp, she convinces him that she has come for Kristoff's best interests and asks if he cares about them. Doom is offended, but his outrage allows her to break free from his grasp. She then explains how Kristoff doesn't want to rule in his place. Doom asks Kristoff if this is true. His son explains that he knows his father would not let anyone else rule in his place, why would his son be any lest. This convinces Doom to let Kristoff leave Latveria and find his destiny elsewhere but orders him to take She-Hulk with him immediately. As they depart, She-Hulk asks if Kristoff can pay her in anything but Latverian Francs. Unfortunately, he does not, which she is less than enthusiastic about hearing.\nBack in Brooklyn, Jennifer calls a meeting with Angie and Patsy Walker. She tells both of them of the trouble she has paying them at this present moment. Their meeting is interrupted by Rufus Randall, a local inventor who rents an office in the same building. He apologizes for interrupting but wanted somewhere to test his latest invention as he is not allowed to test it in his lab because his colleague thinks it is dangerous. When he accidentally blows a hole through an empty chair, Rufus decides to leave the women as they were. Getting back to business, Jennifer decides that it is time to solve the blue file case once and for all. She details how it is a lawsuit filed by one George Saywitz of North Dakota and named She-Hulk, Wyatt Wingfoot, Doctor Druid, the Shocker, Tigra, Pulsa, Nightwatch, and Vibro as defendants. She can't remember anything that might tie her into all of this, but has a feeling that whatever it is, it is important.\n• Jen's new client Kristoff Vernard has been kidnapped by his dad, DOCTOR DOOM!\n• What does fellow lawyer (and recently outted Man Without Fear) MATT MURDOCK know about it?"

Now that the general public is aware that S.H.I.E.L.D. has the Hulk in their roster, the organization is starting to be scrutinized. Hill dumps a bunch of pills into a glass of water. She considers drinking it, but she is distracted by a ping alerting her of an e-mail. She sees that it is regarding Bruce Banner's assistant, Patricia Wolman. Maria slams the glass down and reads the confidential communique.\nNow\nBruce Banner has started a personal journal to keep track of his work and his thoughts, as a private way of sticking it to Director Hill. He comments on the reason why he selected the assistants that he did, and it was because each has their own secrets to hide. At first, he wasn't entirely certain the full scope of Patricia's secret but eventually, he figures out that she clumsily almost spills a cup of coffee and makes Banner drop his tablet on the ground. However, Bruce keeps his emotions in check and has the group get ready for their next experiment. He uses the sliver of Uru taken from Thor's hammer and uses it to power a device that opens a portal to Asgard. Elsewhere, Thor is awoken from his sleep by a discharge of energy from Mjolnir. Having everyone suit up in S.H.I.E.L.D. bio-suits he leads an expedition through the portal, leaving Melinda Leucenstern behind to keep an eye on things there.\nSoon, Banner is leading his team through the portal and they have a rough landing in the middle of Jotunheim. Their arrival does not go unnoticed, as the Frost Giants that live in the region become aware of their presence immediately. Bruce then goes over the mission with his assistants, telling them that they have come looking to get a sample of Eiderdürm, a liquid that he hopes to use as a coolant for new superconductors that will leapfrog humanity ten years ahead of completely abandoning fossil fuels. When they arrive at a waterfall of Eiderdürm, they are approached by Thor, who was drawn there by his hammer. Banner explains that it was likely because of the Uru they used to open a portal to Asgard. Bruce is shocked to discover that Thor doesn't recognize him. When Thor demands to know how they got ahold of Uru, Bruce questions if that is truly what he is upset with, or the fact that mortals were able to create their own bridge to Jotunheim. Hearing that they are mortals brings the Thor a great deal of joy, as he has not interacted with any for some time. This confirms to Bruce that they not only traveled to Asgard, but they also traveled to the past. Still, Thor warns them of the Frost Giants and how they are incredibly protective.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nLater, Bruce Banner is brought up to speed on the She-Hulks mission to capture the Trapster. Needing time to search for the Mad Thinker, Wizard, Red Ghost, and Klaw. He decides to send the two women to Manhattan so Lyra can learn about the outside world. To aid in this, he gives She-Hulk a chemical based on SPIN Tech that will allow Lyra to maintain her strength when she is angry and also allow her to change into human form. He then informs her that Lyra will need to be able to revert to human form as he enrolled her in high school. Soon, Lyra is taken to Midtown High School. She is not impressed with this part of her integration, but Jennifer insists that it is in her best interest. When the school bell, Jen has her go over her cover story one more time and warns her to keep her powers a secret before sending her on her way. Lyra assures her that she knows how to blend in. However, no sooner does Lyra enter the halls that she is noticed by Amelia, one of the most popular girls in school. After she and her friends make fun of her while she is out of earshot, but pretend to be Lyra's friend when she asks where she can find her homeroom.\nMeanwhile, Jennifer Walters arrives at her new condo while talking to Bruce. He has no leads on where the Wizard might be. When Jen sees the size of the condo that she is going to be living in, Bruce tells her that he figured she needed an upgrade from the trailer park. The place brings her to tears. She immediately takes advantage of the amenities believing that she needs to enjoy it after all of her recent trials and tribulations. While at Midtown High, Lyra eats lunch. While she is criticized from afar by Amelia and her friends, two boys from the football team try to convince her to come to their party after the big game and have some \"fun\". She tells the two jocks that they should fight to the death to prove who is worthy to mate with her. She then gets up and sits at another table and makes fast friends with Jake Constantine. This gets the attention of Amelia who is instantly jealous that he is paying attention to the new girl. Later, once school is out, Lyra meets with Jennifer who tells her that she will have to attend school five days a week. She then informs her that they caught a lead on the Wizard and they are leaving right away.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nWith this, Betty has concluded her recounting of events that led to her one person war against Project Echelon. Machine Man questions how sure she was that this doomsday scenario was going to pass. She explains that it the images were so vivid they couldn't have been anything but the truth. In order to confirm her visions, she suggests that the go back to Eleanor and see her both at the same time so that X-51 can confirm everything she has seen. She suggests that they should go immediately and not stop until they get there so they don't get captured by the military or the Avengers.\nMeanwhile, Captain America has come to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on the behalf of General Reginald Fortean. Fortean shows Cap the advances they are making in cybernetics which they are using to help rehabilitate soldiers who have lost limbs in combat. One of the soldiers, one seriously injured when the Red She-Hulk destroyed an Echelon facility, tells Captain America that when he gets better he intends to go back into action. Cap is impressed by this, as most people on the receiving end of a Hulk rampage aren't typically eager to put themselves in the middle of one again. Fortean takes Cap aside and gets to the reason why he asked the Star-Spangled Avenger to come see him. Aware that Cap knows the true identity of the Red She-Hulk, he asks him to reveal who she really is. While on the road, X-51 ignores another summons from Captain America. The pair arrives at the home of Eleanor Bennett, only to discover that it had been recently destroyed by a fire.  She asks the firefighters on the scene about Eleanor, but they didn't find anyone inside the home. It's then that the police on scene recognize Betty from an APB that had been sent out by the military.\nWhen Betty and X-51 leave the scene their vehicle is blocked by a military roadblock. Soldiers order her to stand down, but she refuses to surrender. X-51 converts into a flight mode and tries to fly himself and Ross away from the scene. However, he is blasted with an electromagnetic pulse emitted by a Project Echelon soldier named Devereaux. This causes Machine Man to malfunction and drop Betty. When the soldiers try to move in to apprehend her, she transforms into the Red She-Hulk. However, she is forced back to human form by a telepath named Martens. Betty flees from the soldiers under a hail of bullets, she manages to keep ahead of them until one of the bullets strikes her in the arm. However, she manages to find cover in a nearby marsh. The soldiers then start looking for her, and she uses the cover of the marsh to sneak up behind Martens and knock him out with a blow to the head. With Martens down, she is able to transform into the Red She-Hulk once again. She then leaps away from the soldiers and saves X-51 from Devereaux. Recovering Machine Man, she tells him that she is going to find Eleanor and asks if there is somewhere she can drop him off. X-51 decides to accompany her as he has lost any Avengers protection when her secret identity was outed. The Red She-Hulk then leaps away with her robotic ally in her arms."

Tiberius watches the fight and decides to use a miniaturized Spider-Jammer to nullify Otto's Spider-Sense, causing him to stumble and drop the limo on top ofNormie Osborn, who got saved by Spidey 2099.Liz Allanargues with Spider-Man, which allows Miguel to take Tiberius into his custody.\nOtto contacts hisSpiderlingsto put them onto search mode for Spidey 2099, while also search forHobgoblin, afterwards, he receives a call fromAnna Mariawho offers her help for his doctorate but Otto replies that all of his equipment is at his lab in Horizon, to which he rushes there to avoid being taken by Allan Chemicals.\nSpidey 2099 takes Tiberius to safety while Tyler reports that his existence is stabilizing. Miguel reflects that being in front of Tiberius means thathis timelinewill be restored, includingAlchemax, the evil organization that rules his world, but he has the power of stopping that from ever happening, even if that means sacrificing himself, but doesn't realize that Tiberius overheard their conversation, connecting the dots to discover that he's with a time traveler and that if he saved him, it means that something big will happen to him in the future. He puts his theory to the test by jumping off the roof, forcing Miguel to jump and save him. Miguel stamps Tiberius onto a wall and shuts down his line with Tyler in order to download his personal A.I.LYLAso she can help him discover the connection between Tiberius Stone, Alchemax and Horizon Labs.\nMeanwhile, Grady crosses the Time Gate to the day of theAlpha Incident, right during Peter's demonstration, only to witness Tiberius sabotaging the machines that made the incident happen, while the rest of the team wonders about asking \"Peter\" for help. Otto is removing all of his inventions from his lab, and bumps intoMax Modell. Max andHectortry to tell \"Peter\" to keep his things until the issue with Allan Chemicals is done, but Otto doesn't want to take a risk with them. Max is shocked that he's not the man he hired and then is brushed off by Otto who receives a call from his Spiderlings warning him about the appearance of theoriginal Hobgoblin, only that unbeknownst to them, is actually theGoblin Kingposing as him. Otto orders theLiving Brainto send his equipment toSpider-Island II,while Max warns him that if he leaves, he will be fired.\nMeanwhile, LYLA reveals to Miguel that Tiberius' acts of sabotage led to the actual destruction of Horizon Labs that led to the rise of Alchemax and that today is the day it will happen. Otto curses himself for all of his troubles in one day (he just got fired, theSpider-Botsare failing, his minions are useless, he barely worked on his thesis and his discoveries might be stolen by Allan Chemicals) and to top of that he receives a call fromMary Jane, only to brush her off very rudely after he catches Spidey 2099 swinging over.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nAs Klaw's arm-cannon malfunctions, Spider-Man tackles the Wizard out the window and into the crowd of reporters and journalists, who immediately begin taking pictures and asking what his goals are. Spider-Man angrily reprimands the media for giving the Wizard the exposure he wanted, but is berated for attacking a feeble-minded old man. Seething, Otto webs up the Wizard in order to take the fight somewhere private. Holding onto the flagpole, Spider-Man tells the Wizard that he's lost and should surrender, but the Wizard infiltrates his mind to discover Spider-Man's secret identity, learning of Otto's brain-jacking. Spider-Man drops the Wizard in shock sending him plummeting to crash-land onto a parked car, where he remarks that his brain must finally be shutting down since he can't even read the right minds anymore.\nInside the city hall, the Carnage symbiote jubilantly takes over, killing the Spiderlings before turning to confront Klaw. Realizing something has happened to the Wizard, Klaw attempts to subdue Carnage, but his arm-cannon malfunctions as Carnage attacks. Outside, Otto berates himself for dropping the Wizard, landing next to him. Recalling how he was once in the Wizard's position, Spider-Man reveals his identity and tells the Wizard to get Carnage to stand down and then he'll let him see his son. Carnage abruptly slashes Spider-Man from behind, and Otto scolds himself for letting his guard down before radioing for backup. Carnage tells him help won't be coming, quipping that he originally thought the jacket was a pointless addition as he reveals he'd hunted down and removed the tongues of all the Spiderlings. Furious, Spider-Man attacks, but Carnage shrugs him off, saying that the weapons were fun but that nothing beats the taste of flesh. As Carnage transforms the coat into a flurry of tendrils, Spider-Man grabs the Wizard and urges him to take back control. Klaw grabs Spider-Man from behind and smashes him into a wall, not realizing they're on the same side as he prepares to explode Spider-Man's head. Carnage abruptly impales Klaw with some vibranium taken from the Wizard's arsenal, quipping that the metal is Klaw's one weakness and that he was waiting for the right moment to use it on him. As his body destabilizes, Klaw berates Carnage for ruining their plan when they were so close to winning, apologizing to the Wizard before exploding into a shockwave of sound that sends everyone flying.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:"

One of the effects of this was the restoration ofCaptain America'smemory, which had been tampered with by theIlluminati. As Steve lies sleeping, he has a nightmare in which he remembers the events that were removed from his memory.\nSome time ago, Steve and the rest of the Illuminati were summoned byBlack Panther, who revealed to them the existance of theincursions, events in which parallell universes collide with each other with each universe's planetEarthas the point of impact. Steve feared that the Illuminati would become open to destroying the other planets colliding with theirs as the lesser or two evils, and attempted to steer them away from this. He suggested instead that they assemble theInfinity Gauntletand use its power to avert the next incursion.\nUsing the gauntlet, Steve succeeded in pushing away the other Earth, but theInfinity Gemswere destroyed in the process, with the exception of theTime Gem, which disappeared. Despite the destruction of the gauntlet, Steve was adamant in refusing to entertain the prospect of destroying another world. When the discussions reached an impasse, the rest of the Illuminati decided that the only way forward was to erase Steve's memories of their existence and exclude him from the group.\nIn the present, Steve now awakens from his nightmare and goes to findHawkeyeandBlack Widow. The pair are monitoring various surveillance networks in search of theTyrant Avengers, who seemingly vanished without a trace following their battle against theAvengersofEarth-616. Steve interupts them, telling them to come with him and to follow his cue, as they have a traitor to confront;Tony Stark.\nThoris already waiting for them outside of Tony's lab, and despite being asked to come alone, he has also broughtHyperionandStarbrandwith him, fearing that Steve's temper might cause him to lose control of the situation. On Steve's order, he breaks down the door, as the group confront Tony. While Tony initially talks around their intrusion, Steve quickly reveals that he remembers everything. He asks Tony if they have killed a world already, and before Tony can answer, goes on to ask whose moral code cracked first. When Tony retorts that Steve's moral code was the first to crack, Steve breaks his nose.\nHawkeye holds Steve back, demanding answers as to what's going on. Steve reveals the truth behind the incursions and the Illuminati's re-formation, accusing Tony and the Illuminati of blowing up parallell worlds to save their own. Tony tells them that it hasn't come to that yet, at least not in the way that Steve means, but that it might. He proceeds to power his workshop on, revealing a myriad of armedIron Man Armorsbefore asking Steve if he's going to continue his beligerance or if they're going to calm down and talk about what's happening. Still angry, Steve accuses Tony of simply using him and the other Avengers, and Tony admits that he did, and asks what they're going to do about it. Steve retorts that he's going to beat him bloody, prompting a brawl between the Avengers and Tony's armors.\nThe fight is interrupted by the sudden appearance of the Time Gem, which appears in Steve's hand only to fracture and break, catching the assembled Avengers in a white flash as they awake 48 years in the future."

Black Panther debates with them, saying that while he has killed in the past, he will not take innocent lives, as he fears he must during the coming incursion. The other Panthers tell him that he must do what is needed to protect Wakanda, no matter the consequences to others, and that as a king, T'Challa has already committed acts of evil. Finally, his father asks him why he has not yet killed Namor.\nNamor himself sharpens his trident as he is interrupted by the return of Doctor Strange, clearly changed by whatever he has experienced on his journey.\nIn the arsenal, Bruce Banner is asking Beast why they have so many anti-matter bombs, and why Beast is arming one of them. Beast tells him that, as Tony Stark informed him, they are facing countless doomsday scenarios of possibly infinite variations. Banner remarks that they need better ideas, and Beast answers that that is why Banner is there. He asks him to hold out his hand, and implants him with the same detector device the other Illuminati have in their hands. Banner asks why the device is flashing, and Beast responds that that is the answer to the question of why he is arming one of the bombs.\nTony Stark desperately demands answers from the Black Swan, who taunts him, before they are interrupted by Reed Richards, who calls Tony away. When Reed asks the Swan what that was about, she responds that it was \"a man coming to the ends of himself.\"\nThe Illuminati travel to the incursion point in Egypt, and prepare for battle. Tony asks the Black Panther if he's sure of what he saw, and Panther responds to say that he is. He adds that they have seen much evil in their time fighting the incursions, but that now they will see something truly wicked; facing heroes with the fate of their worlds hanging in the balance.\n• In all of creation, only one Earth has successfully met and triumphed over each Incursion that has threatened it: the Earth of the heroes of the Great Society!"

The guns suddenly crumble, as Cyclops, Magneto and Emma Frost then attack.\nStorm, Iceman and Kitty Pryde watch it on the news and Iceman says he's astonished that Cyclops would go so far.

Kitty argues that they need to do something or the government is going to shut their school down.

Unfortunately, the grass beneath it is burning, indicating that the gold is irradiated, and she forces Sam to take it back into space and throw it into a sun to get rid of it before it can harm anyone. Coming home, Sam nearly admits that he knows that the family is facing Eviction but dodges the issue at the last moment, and takes a nap on the couch while Eva heads to work, where she overhears that Sam's activities have attracted a large number of UFO watchers.\nMeanwhile, back at home, Sam falls asleep dreaming of Jinin, while his younger sister Kaelynn plays, spotting his helmet and putting it on, transforming her into Nova, accidentally blowing up a hole in the wall with the Nova Force powers.

When Sam lets her know that the Watcher told him that his father is still alive, Eva thanks him but tells him that she doesn't need someone to tell her that- she can feel it. As Sam heads to bed for school the next morning he reflects that the next time he sees the Watcher, he'll directly ask him where his dad is, reasoning that they're friends so maybe he'd be willing to help him, not knowing that Uatu was recently murdered.\nSam is back from outer-space and discovers his greatest threat right on his doorstep!"

There are 153 people inhabiting the city and have mysteriously disappeared. Prior to their disappearance, Machine Man had registered a massive surge of transdimensional energy.\nAfter docking their submarine, Iron Man detect life signs below them. Doom takes point and senses something behind a door. The door bursts open and out comes Namor, who immediately attacks Doom given that he had imprisoned him. Doom doesn't seem to acknowledge his previous encounter with Namor. Susan restrains Doom and Namor and ordering them to calm down. They consent. Their fight however had caused significant damages to the docking tunnel, forcing the FF and Namor to escape into the city proper and their access to the submarine cut off. As Susan contacts Coulson on their situation, Namor continues where he left off in finding the people who have taken him prisoner in Lemuria. Susan assigns Falcon to find out what is happening on topside and making sure that there aren't any structural damages, Iron Man and Doom to hack Lemuria's computers while she accompany Namor to find those life signs.\nOn the surface, Coulson and Machine Man digest on what they gathered from Susan. They know of Namor to be an exiled ruler of the Atlantean empire and held in prison until his release by Dr. Mary Storm, and his attempt to flood the American eastern seaboard. Dr. Mary Storm was declared missing following theUltimatum Wave. Machine Man suggest of calling Susan's brother Jonathan for any leads. Just then Machine Man detects more life signs appearing on the monitors numbering within a hundred.\nNamor discuss with Susan about Doom. He is confused of how Doom is currently alive as he saw his death at the hands of Benjamin Grimm. Before Susan could question him, Namor senses something very familiar and promptly dashes off.\nIron Man and Doom talk about what Namor said to the latter about watching him die. Doom is puzzled by Namor's statement to which Iron Man recalled that he went intoanother universeto save their universe and returned to kill everyone in the Ultimatum event. Doom profess that it wasn't him and conclude that it was an impostor who committed those acts. Iron Man and Falcon find more life signs and fluctuation in the dimensional rift, which Falcon theorize that the missing inhabitants are trapped in between dimensions.\nSusan calls to the others that she and Namor has found something that she needs their help. They are confronted by Atlantean soldiers, who are not too pleased to see Namor and identified him as the betrayer. Susan stalls the Atlanteans with her force-fields and urging Namor to get the others for help. Namor reluctantly does so but only to encounter more Atlantean soldiers. Doom, Iron Man, and Falcon have arrive in time. Iron Man analyzed the Atlanteans to be from another universe, specifically Universe-14727. The Atlanteans overwhelms the FF and Susan's shields finally breaks. But the Atlanteans are then ordered to be stop by their leader, Queen Namora, who commands her followers to bring her \"ex-husband\" and his companions before her while she personally dealt with Susan, whom she presumes her to be Namor's \"concubine.\"\n“PALACE OF THE BRINE” (PART 1 of 2)\n• A lavish vacation spot for the super-rich suddenly goes dark, with hundreds missing...\n• And the only suspect is an old frenemy of the FANTASTIC FOUR"

The Avengers then scan him to see if he is telling the truth, and they get their answer. Captain America tells him this better not be another excuse, after last week's encounter withFlash Thompson. Spidey then says \"That's… right. YOU KNEW!\" and punches Cap. Suspecting Spidey is still being controlled by something, the Avengers get ready to attack, when Spidey says that he hit him because they never told him Venom was his friend, Flash. Cap says that Venom is now in space, with theGuardians of the Galaxy.

Black Cat says that she and Electro are even.\nSpidey and the Human Torch meet at theStatue of Liberty, and then learns he lost his powers. He comes down to speak, and Johnny Storm gives him all the TV he missed. Peter then reflects on all the villains who have escaped, and comes up with an idea that Parker Industries could work on. They would help Electro with his out-of-control power, and then buildNew Yorka new Super Villain Prison.\n• Electro’s power is out of control! And only one person can fix it...\n• ...the Superior Spider-Man!\n• Wait. This book’s the AMAZING Spider-Man now.\n• So we’re probably out of luck."

Maxie holds up the paper and exclaims that a crook was caught using a web and believes that Spidey was the one who caught him. Maxie suggests that they use the news to their advantage and get more money, angering Spider-Man at the idea of using Uncle Ben's death for money. Spidey says that he is no hero, and he will not profit off of this in any way. Maxie says nervously that he will do what he says. Spidey leaves Maxie's office, thinking about how preforming has gone from being a star to being a dancing bear.\nAtMidtown High,Liz Alleninvites Peter over to see Spidey live. Because he is Spidey, he makes up a bad excuse about seeing the doctor. Liz takes offense to his horrible excuse and storms away, thinking that Peter lied because he didn't want to go.Flashoverhears the argument and pushes peter against his locker, angry that Peter had shut Liz down.

Who just happened to get a call from one of Peter's teachers that he has been skipping classes (due to his performances as Spider-Man), and the teacher suggests that Peter sees an Counselor. Aunt May thanks the teacher and hangs up, walking with Peter to the cab.\nDuring the Funeral, Peter thinks again on how this was entirely his fault, and promises he'll always be there for Aunt May.

They are surrounded by Friends, loved ones, and every one of their lives Ben has touched and made better for it. It was a life well lived.

He realizes something big is going to happen to him and, while he is scared, he confronts it head on, meeting his soon-to-be-killer and telling it \"I see you.\" With that, his base explodes.\nOn Earth, Steve, Logan, Natasha and Fury talk over different steaks they've had, with Logan ribbing Steve over his figure and Natasha declaring that bear steaks are the best. However, the more jovial tone screeches to a halt as a panicked Thor calls them. Steve asks Fury to join him and, even though Fury declares himself retired, Steve insists. Reaching the Moon, they find Thor, who explains what he saw before finally discovering the Watcher's dead body. They realize the killer was a professional and that they took a lot of the gear he had. Again, Steve asks Fury to help them and, despite Fury warning them that the Watcher's murderer may be a hero, Steve just wants the truth.\nIn The Necropolis, T'Challa is confronted by a mysterious man who gives him various data about possible leads. While the man knows that T'Challa can't investigate them all, he reveals three teams he's gathered to investigate those leads - Emma Frost and Scott Lang go with T'Challa to the center of the Earth, Moon Knight, the Winter Soldier and Gamora head into deep space and Dr. Strange and the Punisher investigate elsewhere.\nOn the Moon, Fury gives his report to someone when Steve walks in. Fury is reassured that no one knows he's around as Steve gives him pieces of what may be a bullet. However, things get worse when there's a call from the Fantastic Four: a Mindless One is wrecking New York and smacking the Thing around. Spider-Man shows up to give Ben a hand. Spidey recognizes the beast and realizes that they're not supposed to be telepathic. The beast screams in agony over the things he's seen and the things he's done. Ben realizes he's wielding an Ultimate Nullifier and tries to talk the beast down. However, it doesn't work and the beast shoots himself with it. By this time, Fury and the Avengers arrive. Steve wants the Nullifier left alone until it is contained and Fury declares the battlezone a murder scene.\nElsewhere, a group of villains realize the other Mindless Ones are evolving and they are, too. However, one of them notes this, but doesn't care - he wants to know what's inside the Eye of the Watcher..."

Or trying to, as his attempts at doing so are being interrupted by someone climbing towards him. It's Sigurd, the Ever-Glorious, and he has an offer to make, with Gram as payment. Kaluu rebuffs his claims of being Asgard's greatest hero, before asking how he re-acquired his old sword.\nSome nights before, Sigurd scales an apartment building in Manhattan. Inside, Loki and Verity Willis are talking, the god of mischief having gone to the effort of cooking for her. Verity decides to skip to the business, and asks Loki if he has an ulterior motive for inviting her around. Meanwhile, Sigurd sneaks inside the apartment, using an invisibility belt stolen from A.I.M.. Verity tries to tell Loki she won't help him break into somewhere, only to stop on noticing the invisible Sigurd, carrying Loki's sword.\nSigurd's attempts to flirt with Verity quickly fail, at which point he informs Loki of his intent to borrow his sword for a while, and that there's no need for them to fight. Loki flashes back to some time earlier, to another inconvenient summons from the All-Mother, who are still incensed about his previous failure to retrieve Lorelei, and express hope he's better at finding Sigurd. Loki questions why he needs to bring Sigurd in, when the Dirsir are supposed to be tracking him, only to be implicitly threatened with his own freedom being revoked. Therefore, it's down to Sigurd's freedom, or Loki's. Loki draws his backup sword, Laevateinn, which Sigurd mocks. The two fight, resulting in Loki being kicked out of the window. Fortunately, he's saved by the local washing line, and his seven-league boots. He provokes Sigurd into attacking him again. The two parry, until Sigurd cuts the line, sending both gods plummeting into a dumpster. Violence quickly follows, ending with Gram stabbing through the dumpster, and Sigurd slinking off into the night.\nIn the here and now, Kaluu asks what exactly Sigurd wants. Conversation turns to the wheel of reincarnation. Since Sigurd, like all Asgardians, is destined to end up in Valhalla, he's concerned about any potential injuries the Valkyrie waiting for him will inflict. In essence, he wants to avoid going there at all, to reincarnate into someone else. Kaluu agrees to help. Using the sword's truth-bearing properties, the two sign an agreement in blood, at which point Kaluu turns out to be Mephisto, who is overjoyed to have tricked a god. The promised \"wheel of reincarnation\" turns out to be a torture device called \"the wheel of rein-incarnation\". As Sigurd tries to attack Mephisto, he is restrained, and the carpet Mephisto was sitting on turns out to be the contract. Mephisto goes to examine it.\nOnly he discovers it's not his contract, it's Loki's. He switched the prayer mats while Sigurd was explaining things, using his vanishing coat, Lorelei's amulet of invisibility, and the invisibility belt to disguise himself. Mephisto is outraged, on account of Loki using cheap misdirection to fool him, something \"the young punk\" would do. Whispering, Mephisto reveals that he knows what's happened to the younger Loki, and offers his commendations.\nAngered, Loki tells him to leave, and Mephisto merrily does. Sigurd, meanwhile, is teleported right into the All-Mother's throne room, still in chains. Gaea and Igunn both express reservations about imprisoning Sigurd, though Freyja states it is necessary.\nLater, Loki addresses someone, stating his guilt over Sigurd's imprisonment, and his intention to go to Asgardia's dungeons and break Sigurd out. He asks Verity, Lorelei and Thor if they are with him.\n• Ancient hero Sigurd wants his magic sword back from Loki… The All-Mother wants Sigurd back from Midgard…\n• …and Loki wants to put a crew together for a caper that’ll rock the nine realms."

Meanwhile, Alexander Summers visits his brother in jail. They argue about what Cyclops did and after Havok leaves, he is approached by Captain America and Thor. Captain America offers Havok a spot on the Avengers and to lead a squad of both Avengers and X-Men in order to represent mutantkind. Havok refuses them however.\nMeanwhile, the man who had part of his brain removed is revealed to be Avalanche who goes on a rampage in the middle of town. Captain America, Thor and Havok team up to stop him and he throws himself off of a cliff.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nCap tells Wolverine that Havok has agreed to lead the squad and appeal to the mutant and human communities. Wolverine dismises the idea, saying that there is no such thing as a mutant community and that it's just the same nonsense Cyclops was spouting. He appears to change his mind however, when an elderly human who Havok saved gives Havok a hug and tells him he doesn't care what they say about mutants.\nMeanwhile, the Red Skull is appearing on television and using his telepathic powers to make humans kill mutants all over the world. Meanwhile, Rogue is approached by her captors, two of whom have arrived to feed her. Rogue manages to steal Dancing Water's powers and teleports away.\nMeanwhile, Red Skull watches over the sleeping form of the Scarlet Witch and contemplates that despite the fact that she is a mutant, gypsy, and a jew, she is beautiful and deceptively human. He wakes her and she attempts to fight him off. He remarks that what she did when trying to save Rogue was remarkably brave, and tells her that he learned of her father's mutant powers during the war, but that he was distracted by duty before he could focus his attentions on him. He shows Wanda his \"School for Gifted Humans\" and tells her that he believes they have interjecting interests, like her attempt to erase mutantkind. Wanda tells him that she'll never share any insights with the likes of him.\nSkull explains that for him, 1942 was mere months ago and that Arnim Zola recorded his consciousness in a cloned body, which was preserved in a safe bunker to be awakened 70 years later. Skull woke to find the climate in America to be very similar to that before the rise of Nazi Germany and that mutants were the ultimate scapegoats for a country looking for someone to blame. Wanda attempts to excuse what she did, but the Red Skull uses Xavier's powers to brainwash her, and she tells him that with enough casting time and an immense source of power, she can erase mutantkind again.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nThe newest Collectors' Edition is here!

Suddenly, she is attacked by Omega White, who accuses her of killing his brother and the rest of his family.\nElsewhere, EVA has tracked down Nightcrawler, and accuses him of leaving the team to perish, so he could have his revenge. He claims he would have come back to save them. She says he is a coward and stabs him. In desperation, he runs away.\nBy now, Evan has found the Skinless Man, the one who killed Fantomex. Looking for revenge, he chases the killer, until Skinless Man offers him a trade - the still-viable heart of Fantomex, to jump-start the mutate hero, in exchange for Skinless Man's safety. Then he shatters the heart. He is immediately killed by Deadpool, but Evan, losing his sanity, releases a blast of energy which rocks the complex.\nElsewhere, the Shadow King is looking for Psylocke, and finds Omega White, who says he killed her. However, this is a ruse: Psylocke wiped Omega White's artificial mind, and controlled his body to capture the Shadow king and contain him. He will now be trapped in Omega White's psychic link with no way out.\nDeadpool finds Wolverine and resuscitates him. Wolverine immediately rushes to find Daken, but tells Wolverine to find the rest of the team and get them out.\nMeanwhile, Evan has started muttering to himself about power. He encounters Psylocke, but it is actually Mystique is disguise. He prepares to kill her, but Nightcrawler teleports her away.\nFinally, Wolverine finds Daken outside the base. The two men fight to the death. As the fight goes on, Wolverine acknowledges to himself that he is holding back his animal side, as Daken deserves to be killed by a man in full control of his actions. Meanwhile, Daken is considering what he would say to his father, how he would explain that he had years of Romulus' tortures to imagine what his life would be with the love of a father and mother. Wolverine gets the upper hand by slashing Daken. Eventually, Wolverine overpowers Daken by drowning him. At the end of the fight, Wolverine kneels over the drowned, beaten corpse of his son.\nEvan comes to him and explains that there was nothing he could do. Sabretooth steps out and explains that this was all his plan, to destroy Wolverine by making him kill his own son. As the villain gloats, Evan attacks him and begins punching him. However, Logan talks him down, saying that revenge leads to nothing but misery. The villains and the heroes depart. Psylocke leaves her sword behind in the wreckage of the base as it sinks into Hammer Bay.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nMeanwhile, in the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, Evan is reading a book about meditation he received from Wolverine when Deadpool breaks into his room. Evan questions if it's wise to sneak up on an Apocalypse, and Deadpool tells him never to refers to himself as \"an Apocalypse\", telling him he's nothing like him. Evan tells him that he has the same capacity for evil as Apocalypse and that he would have killed Mystique unless Nightcrawler had rescued her. Deadpool responds that everyone has the capacity to be people with bad tempers, but the difference is that Evan never stopped fighting, just like Fantomex taught him. Evan says that his entire life was a lie, but Deadpool responds that no one really remembers their childhood, but what they learn is built into their fiber and that no matter if it was real or illusion, Fantomex raised him right. He adds that he'll always be there for Evan when he needs him. Evan thanks him by calling him a hero, something Deadpool claims to never have been called and he decides to leave before he spoils the mood with a fart joke, taking with him Evan's meditation book, claiming that meditation is for hippies or psychopaths trying to be hippies, and that Evan would get more use out of some \"Playguy\"-magazines he left him."

The superhumans living there have powers than range from minor significance to intergalactic threat; Kree interference created the Inhumans; use of magics; repetitive abuses of the space-time continuum; surviving Badoon and Skrull invasions, Thanos and Galactus; a Watcher visits it more frequently than any other planet in the galaxy; and the Phoenix Force was recently destroyed.

Freyja takes offense that the greater universe would consider a planet in her protectorate a threat because it bothers them. She warns them that any move against Earth would meet reprisals from Asgards and takes her leave. J-Son then takes it as a suggestion to declare Earth off-limits to offworlders.

This has led to a battle with the Hulk. While Maria Hill tries to get a local real estate agent to safety, three agents of the organization attacks. At first, it appears that Maria is using Buddy as a human shield, however, she is merely doing this to protect him from a sonic device she unleashes that incapacitates the three attackers. After Buddy runs for cover, Maria unmasks one of her attackers and injects him with a drug that wakes him up, incapacitates him, and prevents him from lying. When the man wakes up, she demands to know who is responsible for this attack.\nMeanwhile, outside, the Hulk and the Abomination continues to fight, devastating the entire town. Before Hill can get answers from her attackers, they begin to teleport away. Despite this, Maria manages to get ahold of one of the teleportation wristbands, but her assailants escape. With the Hulk having to battle a foe that is mindless and more powerful than him, Maria calls backup. Just as the Hulk begins losing ground in the fight, Captain America, Iron Man, Captain Marvel and Sunspot of the Avengers arrive on the scene to lend the Hulk a hand. As the Avengers attack the Abomination, the battle is being watched by the man who put all these plans into motion. When his subordinates question his ability to destroy the Hulk, he points out that he faced the Hulk on the day the monster was born. Since then he has been studying gamma radiation and has become the world's greatest gammacrinologist. As such, when he recreated the Abomination he added something that the Avengers will never expect.\nBack at the scene of the battle, Captain Marvel and Iron Man blast the Abomination with full power. While Captain America checks on the Hulk, he sends Sunspot to look for survivors to bring them to safety. Cap is joined by Maria Hill as the Hulk reverts back to human form, and he demands to know where the Hulk has been in the last while. When Hill is reluctant to answer, Captain America realizes that she had known where Banner was the entire time. Meanwhile, Iron Man realizes the reason that the Abomination has not been fighting back is due to the fact that he has been increasing his gamma radioactivity, bringing it up to a highly toxic level. While not far away, Banner wakes up screaming in agony. Maria Hill tells Captain America to take it easy on Bruce as he is suffering from severe brain damage. However, they are both shocked when Banner appears to be back to normal intelligence, but he doesn't know who Maria or Cap are. Even more troubling, Banner begins flipping between his normal self and having amnesia. The amnesiac version of Banner doesn't believe the Hulk is real and tells people to leave him alone.\nBy this point, the Abomination has fought off the other three Avengers and resumes his hunt for the Hulk. As Captain America scrambles to get control of the situation, Bruce -- between spates of gibberish -- insists that he should turn into the Hulk to save his friends. Hill protests against this, pointing out that the Hulk's healing factor might be repairing his brain, but not his mind. With the Avengers losing the battle against the Abomination, Banner runs into the fray, turning into the Hulk along the way. The Abomination manages to overpower the Hulk and beats him senseless. Maria orders the Hulk to stand down, saying they'll get help. However, the Hulk refuses to surrender, and when he pulls himself out of the rubble he is carrying Captain America's shield.\n“BANNER D.O.A” GETS READY TO TAKE YOU INTO A NEW TWIST IN HULK HISTORY!\n• BANNER goes to a dark place and could take the AVENGERS with him\n• Only HULK can save Banner…but will he?"

The captain declares that he would rather die, so Rocket kills him. He then demands the helmsmen activate self-destruct sequence and kills them when they refuse, activating an override. He then flies out of the doomed ship as it is set to crash into a ship Drax is on. Gamora attempts to rescue him before Iron Man catches them both.\nSix weeks previously, dignitaries from major galactic empires meet in the Negative Zone. This includes J-Son of Spartax, the Supreme Intelligence, Gladiator, Annihilus, the Brood Queen, Freyja, All-Mother of Asgard, and Y-Gaar of the Brotherhood of the Badoon. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss Earth, the planet where all sorts of chaos has spawned. The superhumans living there have powers than range from minor significance to intergalactic threat; Kree interference created the Inhumans; use of magics; repetitive abuses of the space-time continuum; surviving Badoon and Skrull invasions, Thanos and Galactus; a Watcher visits it more frequently than any other planet in the galaxy; and the Phoenix Force was recently destroyed. Gladiator agrees with J-Son's points, arguing that Thanos was in believing that the Infinity Gem are on Earth, and implies that they should conquer the planet. However, J-Son says it can't be done. Freyja takes offense that the greater universe would consider a planet in her protectorate a threat because it bothers them. She warns them that any move against Earth would meet reprisals from Asgards and takes her leave. J-Son then takes it as a suggestion to declare Earth off-limits to offworlders. Y-Gaar only smiles deviously.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nRaces and Species:\nItems:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nArcade seems to have sufficient technology to physically capture and hold all 16 of them.

TheIlluminatiassembled to deal with these incursions in secret, after they had captured aBlack Swan.[5]They reverse engineered the Black Swan'santimatter bombso they could destroy other incursion worlds, for an incursion can be stopped or prevented by destroying even just one of the Earths.[6]\nBuilder systems:Ex Nihilo, Aleph, and Abyss\nCaptain Universesensed that the universe was dying (a symptom of the incursions) and chose a \"broken\" host,Tamara Devoux, to reflect that.[7]Her first \"children,\" theBuilders, had created \"systems\" to help shape the universe. Three Builder creations—Ex Nihilo,Abyss, andAleph—forced theAvengersto expand after they had flung Origin Bombs to Earth from theirGardenonMars. The new Captain Universe, now an Avenger, ordered Ex Nihilo and Abyss to stop and she destroyed theirAleph.[8]\nBuilder systems:Nightmask and Starbrand, ascended by the White Event\nMeanwhile, the incursions caused awave of destructionacross theSuperflow, where the Builders had created structures and stations to fireWhite Events. The last of these stations fired their last White Events in desperation before they collapsed. OnEarth-616, this resulted in the ascension ofNightmask (Adam)(a creation of Ex Nihilo) andStarbrand (Kevin Connor). These were newer Builder systems compared to theGardeners.[9]\nStarbrand, Nightmask, Abyss, and Ex Nihilo as Avengers\nRecognizing Earth as the \"multiversal fracture point,\" some of the lifeforms from Ex Nihilo's Origin Bombs sent a signal to the Builders in space: \"System failure. Multiversal fracture point. World terminal.\"[10]The Builders soon began their aggression on the universe. Captain Universe noticed this and told the Avengers that they must get bigger. As per Captain Universe's suggestions, the Avengers recruited Builder systems Ex Nihilo, Abyss, Starbrand, and Nightmask.[11]\nThe Builders' World Killer destroying Galador on their way to Earth\nThe planetGaladorbecame one of the earliest victims of theBuilder Armadaduring theBuilders' campaign. Located 60,000 light years away formEarth, it faced ruthless attacks from the Builders' ground forces, the mechanical exterminators calledAlephs. Galador was not undefended and its heroes, theSpaceknights, fought bravely against the invaders. ACuratorand aCaretakerreported the resistance to their Builder masters, who simply replied that all worlds resist. AfterGaladorianchildrenSannoandKiruhad been saved by the Spaceknights,Captain Universeappeared and told the hopeful youths that it was not enough. The Builders arrived with theirWorld Killer; Sanno and Kiru embraced one last time as their planet was destroyed.[12]\n\nThe Avengers gathering to discuss the Builder threat\nAfter the attack on Galador, Captain Universe reappeared at thePeak, headquarters ofS.W.O.R.D, in a comatose state. S.W.O.R.D. had been busy dealing with a significant influx of potential alien invaders, who were actually nonviolent refugees, and had the Avengers help. Once the Avengers (includingEx Nihilo) were called in about the return of Captain Universe, they were also informed about aKreeopen channel distress signal, something they would never normally do. As they watched the footage of a doomed crew from a Kree moon being slaughtered by Alephs and Gardeners,Abigail Brandrevealed that the trajectory of the Builders' path of destruction was heading directly to Earth.[12]\nHours after the distress signal, S.W.O.R.D. picked up military chatter from almost all members and space empires of theGalactic Council.Smasher, a Superguardian of theShi'arImperial Guard, confirmed that she had been recalled and noted that the order included all Subguardians to be on standby, meaning heavy losses was expected. After Ex Nihilo andAbysshad confirmed that Earth alone stood no chance against the Builders, the Avengers decided to stand alongside the other worlds in space, thoughTony Starkstayed behind.[12]\nThe Galactic Council rallying together against the Builders\nAs the Builders continued to terrorize everything in their path, an assembly was called for war on the Citadel of theGalactic Council, located in the neutral territory of Nomad. Although the former greatSkrull Empirehad fractured into warring factions,Kl'rt the Super-Skrullmanaged to convince most of theSkrullwarlords to unite under him and presented himself to the Council for admittance. Among the council leaders wereGladiatorof theShi'ar Empire, theSupreme IntelligenceandRonan the Accuserof theKree Empire, andJ'sonof theSpartax Empire. Even historical enemies such as theBrood QueenandAnnihilusof theNegative Zonehad agreed to join forces for the Builder threat was bigger than them all.[13]\nRepresentatives from hundreds of thousands of worlds gathered, including the Avengers of Earth, but even with all of this, the Council did not believe they could challenge the Builder fleet in direct combat. The Super-Skrull showed the Council footage of the Skrull warlordDm'yr's victory against a small advance fleet by catching them by surprise, though at the cost of the Skrulls' lives. The Council decided to do a surprise attack of their own at the Corridor, which lay in the Builders' path.[13]\nThe Council ambushing the Builders at the Corridor\nThe alliedCouncil Armadahid among the dense circling asteroid belt of the singularity at the Corridor. The plan was to pin the Builder fleet between the black hole and the allied forces. After lying in wait for three days, they detected the enemy Builder fleet passing by and launched a massive ambush. In the midst of the intense fire fight, Ronan the Accuser alerted the allied armada that the Supreme Intelligence had deduced the identity of the Builders' command vessel, based on the observed movements. The Council Armada focused their attack on the ship and destroyed it.[13]\nThe Builders decimating the allied forces\nHowever, just as the allied worlds believed that they had won, the actual Builder fleet uncloaked themselves and completely overpowered the Council Armada in a sudden, decisive attack. Within just a minute, the Galactic Council lost a third of their entire fleet and was forced to retreat.Manifoldmanaged to teleport half of the Avengers out of the battlefield, but a ship containing the remaining Avengers was caught in the explosion of a destroyed Shi'ar cruiser. They were captured by the Builders.[14]\nScattered, the Shi'ar retreated to the rendezvous point, the agri-worldWhaan Prime. With the Avengers'Quincarrierdamaged beyond all repair, they boarded the Shi'ar flagship,Lilandra. Smasher noted that all communication networks went dark right after they had retreated. Meanwhile, Gladiator discussed next steps with his councillors but they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of four Builder crafts. Gladiator rallied the Shi'ar, and with help from the Avengers, they defeated the persuit fleet.[15]\nJerran Ko being ordered by the Builders to kill himself and poison Whaan Prime\nThe Shi'ar and Avengers watching the spoils of their first \"victory\"\nHowever, in defeat, anEx NihiliinamedJerran Koand hisAlephwent down to Whaan Prime, a harmless, helpless farming world. While happy to see a garden, Jerran Ko knew the task his creators ordered him to perform and asked his Aleph if it believed in the afterlife. Aleph revealed that it would live on in the code and reminded Jerran Ko to wound the enemy if defeated. Jerran Ko asked the Aleph to tell the others that the days when the Gardeners meant life were better and were now long gone. He commited suicide and poisoned the entire world of Whaan Prime. The Shi'ar and Avengers could only save a few lucky hundreds of thousands of refugees, while everyone else died from disease and decay. It was worse than just death.[15]\n100,000,000 refugees at the Behemoth to escape the Builders\nThe broken Galactic Council converged at the ringworldBehemoth, located in trans-galactic space. 100,000,000 refugees and counting were gathered there, having fled their home worlds to escape the Builders. Some of the rufugees came from plague worlds such as Whaam Prime, overloading the already stressed medical teams. Guilty for all the pain and suffering his creators had wrought, Ex Nihilo provided the ringworld with thousands of gardens and encouraged them to continuously yield food. Many refugees tended to these gardens to distract them from what they had lost.[16]\nDuring the Galactic War Council meeting, J'son and the Supreme Intelligence revealed the true strength of the Builder armada: 17,000 light cruisers, 3000 carriers, 2000 heavy cruisers, 600 worldships, and 12 World Killers. Furthermore, that was only the main fleet and there were smaller ones tearing through clusters at the edge of Council space. Outnumbered, outgunned, and outmatched, the Council debated whether or not to surrender and live or to fight to their almost certain deaths. When Gladiator noted their ignorance of their enemy,Captain Americaoffered the Council to see Ex Nihilo. However, Ex Nihilo was confused as much of what he saw in the war, especially Jerran Ko's suicide, went against everything he had been taught; he believed that there was something wrong. Nevertheless, Ex Nihilo provided the insight that the Builders were efficient, direct, and linear, and the Supreme Intelligence realized that the true target of the Builders was Earth.[16]\nMeanwhile, on the Builders' command vessel, the captured Avengers were visited byEx Nihila, the Builders' aide. Ex Nihila decided to bring theKree-humanhybridCaptain Marvelto her Builder masters, who explained to Carol that they were not destroyers by nature and in fact much of the universe was cultivated by them, either directly or through theirsystems. Among the captured Avengers were several of these systems:Starbrand,Nightmask, andAbyss, whom the Builders and theEx Nihiliiwere surprised to see as they had thought all theAbyssihad died out. Even more surprising was the still-comatoseCaptain Universeamong them, the Builders' Great Mother. The Builders' interrogation was interrupted by a messenger linking toJ'sonofSpartax.[16]\nThe Builders attacking the Behemoth\n40,000,000+ refugees dead in a single attack\nBehind the backs of the Council, J'son pleaded to the Builders for a truce and asked the Builders what they wanted. The Builders revealed that they simply want to perserve the universe, which could only be done by destroying the Earth. J'son offered to give the Builders Earth and end the war, but the Builders did not even see it as a war, only a cleansing. They thanked J'son for giving them the Council's location, as the signal was tracked. Realizing what he had done, J'son tried to warn the other Council members, but it was too late. The Builders sent two ships to crash into the ringworld, obliterating the sanctuary. Out of the 100,000,000 refugees escaping from now-dead worlds, over 40,000,000 died.[16][17]\nWorld after world, including Hala, surrendering to the Builders\nThe catastrophic loss at the Behemoth greatly diminished the hope in the universe. It was a message, and one that the Builders would repeat to all worlds in their path in the weeks that followed: \"You cannot run from us.\" \"There is no place in this universe you can hide.\"[17]\nIn a surprising turn, the Builders offered terms to the remaining resistant worlds. They may live, so long as they completely and utterly submitted to the Builders. Proud, ancient worlds decided to pick life and surrendered. TheCentauriansofCentauri-IVand theKymelliansofKymelliawere the first to bend the knee, and then a hundred more desperate worlds followed. When the Builder Armada closed in onHala, the Supreme Intelligence conceded that they could not win.[17]\nThe Council luring out the main Builder forces at Hala\nUpon Hala's surrender, Ronan the Accuser and his forces were recalled despite his wish to stay and fight. The Kree had represented a fourth of the remaining Council Armada, turning an already hopeless situation critical. The Spartax Empire also withdrew shortly after; before leaving the Behemoth ruins, J'son informed the remaining Council members and the Avengers that the Builders were keeping the Avengers lost from the Corridor battle as prisoners, which he knew from his failed negotiation with them. For the rest of the Council, Captain America devised a plan to defeat the Builders at Hala.[17]\nThe Council capturing a Builder World Killer and using it against the Builders\nThe following day, Ronan and the Kree fleet returned to Hala to publicly lay down arms in front of a single Builder. The Builders thought themselves as great teachers to humble entire empires with merely a single member. However, just as the ceremony finished, the Council fleet arrived at Hala to attack the Builder fleet gathered there. As Captain America expected, the Builders counterattacked; the Council fleet was merely a diversion and bait to lure away the bulk of the Builders' attack vessels, leaving behind only their command ship and their World Killers. The teleporting AvengerManifoldsent an elite team of Avengers and Shi'ar Imperial Guard members to take control of one of the World Killers and used it to fire against the others. Thor and the Skrulls soon captured another World Killer and caused massive damage to the Builders' fleet.[17]\nStarbrand signalling the Council's first major win against the Builders\nWith the World Killers turned against them and the command ship damaged to the point that it could not escape, the Builders bitterly called a retreat for the majority of their forces, except for their third wing. Before teleporting away, the Builders ordered Ex Nihila to scuttle the ship and join the third wing in battle, asked her to make her death \"mean something,\" and then abandoned her.[17]Manifold transported a rescue team to the Builders' main vessel and freed the captured Avengers. They were discovered by Ex Nihila, but instead of attacking them, she decided to turn away and left them alone.[18]The now-freedStarbrand, who had accidentally gotten hispowerfrom a defectiveWhite Event, resolved to use the Brand's power and destroyed the leftover Builder forces. For the first time ever, the Council defeated and scattered the Builder armada.[17]\nThanks to intel gathered by the Shi'ar, the Council learned that the Builders had lost all of their World Killers in the recent attack, meaning they could no longer destroy planets on a whim. However, the Council only had half of their fleet remaining. The Brood Queen birthed many newBrooddrones to serve. Meanwhile, Annihilus gathered a newAnnihation WaveandMentorconfirmed to Gladiator that they could convert threeStargatesto access theNegative Zone. Captain America suggested to use the recent victory to talk to the Builders.[18]\nOn Hala, the sole Builder emissary stayed as he knew the Builder loss was only temporary. To prove it to the Accuser Ronan, he asked the Supreme Intelligence to calculate the chances of Builder victory against the Council armada, which was 83.2%, and the chances of the Builders retaining control over the Kree Empire, which was 70.1%. The lone Builder declared Hala his. Soon after, he received a message from Gladiator to discuss a parley. The Council seemingly agreed to surrender to the Builders.[18]\nThor killing a Builder in front of the universe\nThe Kree Empire rejoining the war against the Builders\nAfter the emissary had discussed with his fellow Builders, the Builders agreed to drop their interference on the communication networks so they could broadcast the surrender to the universe. The Builder on Hala ordered Ronan to gather all Kree of any political, societal, and militiary importance to witness \"the finest day in the history of the Kree Empire.\" When the Council diplomat,Thor, arrived, he threwMjolnirto the heavens to appear unarmed. The universe watched as Thor knelt before the Builder, who agreed to spare all worlds except for Earth; however, the universe also watched as Thor recalled his mighty hammer and slayed the Builder in front of him. Before dying, the Builder warned that their resistance would result ineverything dying. Thor and Ronan rallied the Accuser Corps and the liberated Kree Empire rejoined the war.[4]\nThe Council fighting back against the Builders\nAgainst the will of the Supreme Intelligence, who knew that the Council was still outmatched and preferred to survive by remaining subservient to the Builders, Ronan led the Kree Empire's armies into battle once more. Ronan's Accusers launched a surprise attack onKymellia III, destroying the Alephs there and freeing theKymellians, who rejoined the war. Meanwhile, the survivingSpaceknightsfromGaladorhelped liberateCentauri IVfrom the Builders, and the Skrull warlords managed to saveKorm Primebut with a heavy cost to themselves. However, none of them paid as heavily as the Shi'ar.[19]\nThe Council unleashing the Annihilation Wave\nA Builder extinguishing the Council's last hope\nThe Shi'ar forces and the Avengers fought alongside each other at the hottest battlefields:Rigel,Formuhaut, andChize. Across all of them, they suffered heavy casualties; Formuhaut was a stalemate but they were not going to hold, and they lost the battle for Chize. Despite the successive outbreaks of victory, the Council was losing momentum and it became apparent that they were still going to lose. As one last resort, they reluctantly opened a portal to theNegative Zonevia aStargateand unleashed theAnnihilation Wave, which hadravaged the universepreviously.Annihiluscommanded his drones to kill all Builders, but a Builder noted the simple hive-mind nature of the drones and manipulated them into wiping each other out. With the Annihilation Wave decimated, the Council ran out of options and Gladiator prepared to meet his end head-on, barring some unforeseen miracle.[19]\nAbyss and Ex Nihilo finding the other Gardeners, who have left the Builders\nBack whenAbysswas freed during thebattle at HalaandEx Nihiladecided to abandon her post, Ex Nihila telepathically communicated with last Abyss: \"Come find us.\" Abyss had informed her brotherEx Nihiloof this when they reunited and they ventured away from Builder War to find Ex Nihila. Abyss' psychic link to Ex Nihila enabled them to track her to a faraway planet where they were greeted by theGardeners, who had left their Builder masters.[18]\nAbyss and the Ex Nihilii restoring Captain Universe\nThe Gardeners gathered around the last Abyss and explained to Ex Nihilo that all of theirAbyssihad died and the Builders had recalled them following the creation of thenewuniversal superstructure. In turn, Ex Nihilo revealed that he did not stop creating life, making it apparent that the Abyssi's deaths were tied to the Ex Nihilii being forbidden from creating life-giving gardens, their entire purpose of existing. No longer willing to be expendable servants for the Builders at best, or killers of worlds at worst, Abyss and the Ex Nihilii banded together and restored Captain Universe, bringing forth a miracle.[20]\nFinally awake from her comatose state, Captain Universe boarded the Builders' command vessel and asked her first children why and when did death become their way, as they had always revered life before. The Builders explained that all universes in theMultiversewere dying (from theincursions) and the only way to stop this was to destroy the \"axis point\" that wasEarth. Still, Captain Universe would not let her children do that and killed one of the Builders, who did not believe that she was going to stop them. The other Builders retaliated and she was forced to kill the rest of them. One Builder survived and departedEarth-616to another universe. Before doing so, he activated the \"black band command\" to have theAlephsdestroy everything.[19]\nIncursion between Earth-616 and Earth-13131\nBack onEarth, anotherincursionstarted where the Earths ofReality-616andReality-13131began to collide, threatening to destroy both realities unless one of the Earths was destroyed. With the Avengers off fighting the Builders in space, Earth had been under attack by the Mad TitanThanosand his army, including theBlack Order, but the threat of the incursion was far greater than any of that. TheIlluminatiassembled once more to the site of the incursion: theTwelve Apostles,Australia.[17]\nAs the Illuminati discussed destroying the other Earth, a seemingly friendly Aleph suddenly appeared from the other universe and requested them to come with it. They arrived at theWorld Killerof the other universe where they met that universe's Builders, as well as its peculiarly red Ex Nihilii, one of whom extractedEbony Maw'sMind WebfromDoctor Strange's head. The Illuminati learned that the Builders used to freely travel across theMultiversethrough theSuperflow, the space between universes, but the incursions collapsed it and the Builders pledged to stop the end of everything.[21]\nThe Builders of Earth-13131 destroying their Earth to stop the incursion\nThe other universe's Builders informed the Illuminati that the local Builders of Earth-616 had been defeated. They knew this from a captured Builder, who was actually the same Builder who withdrew from Earth-616 to escape Captain Universe; he had landed in this universe due to its extreme proximity as the result of the incursion. Before sending the Illuminati home to their universe, the Builders revealed that they planned to destroy all Earths to preserve theMultiverse, but their World Killers were too big to travel through the incursion point, so they urged the Illuminati to destroy their own Earth. When the Illuminati returned home, they watched as the Builders' World Killer destroyed the other Earth, ending the incursion.[21]\nDockrum VII declaring itself an Avengers World\nWith the Builders gone, the World Killers destroyed or captured, and the Ex Nihilii defected, only the Alephs remained of the Builders' once-great military. Inspired by the Avengers and the public slaying of a Builder at Hala, the rest of the universe rebelled against the Builders' leftover forces. Once the Avengers and Shi'ar helped liberate the planetDockrum VII, its grateful people decided to erect a giant \"A\" symbol as a monument to their saviors. Before Captain America could protest, Oracle of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard reminded him that the Galactic Council by itself fell apart; every victory they had against the Builders to turn the tide was thanks to the Avengers and Captain America's strategies. Dockrum VII was free and was now an Avengers World.[22]\nBuilder-controlled worlds becoming Avenger Worlds\nWorld after world raised the Avengers banner as they retook the universe from the Builders' Alephs, and at the end, they were all Avenger Worlds. However, the Council's great celebration was cut short when Gladiator got word from the reestablished universal communication network that Earth had fallen under attack by the ruthless Thanos. To repay the Avengers for defeating the Builders, the Galactic Council was more than willing to devote a portion of their armada to reclaim Earth from the Mad Titan.[22]\nThe Council offered what they could spare, tookTitan, and made their way to Earth, but Thanos' fleet was greater than anticipated while the Council's fleet was extremely battle weary from the Builder War. Furthermore, Thanos' forces controlled the formidable defense station known as thePeak. Gladiator, Ronan, Super-Skrull, and Annihilus personally helped the war heroes take back the Peak, Ronan executedBlack Dwarfof theBlack Order, and the Council fleet broke through the enemy barricade, enabling the Avengers to go save their own world.[23]\nThe Gardeners healing the universe devastated by the Builder War\nIn the aftermath of the Builder War, theGardenersgathered aroundWhaan Primeto mournJerran Ko. Newly reformed, they went around the universe to rejuvenate the worlds ravaged by the Builders and returned to their original purpose as a force of life. Elsewhere, the Galactic Council went back to their worlds; Gladiator expanded the Imperial Guard and the Skrull Empire was united once more, with Kl'rt being crowned emperor. However, Annihilus captured the Stargatesfrom the warthat linked to the Negative Zone and turnedPraxis-2into Annihilation World.[25]\nBlack Swan warning that there are threats greater than the Builders involved in the incursions\nMeanwhile, after Thanos' defeat on Earth, theIlluminatireturned to their capturedBlack Swan, who offered them her counsel. Thanks to herincursionsensor, she knew about the recent incursion and laughed at the Builder involvement. As the Builders wereone of the factionsin the incursions, she possessed great knowledge of them. The Black Swan revealed that the Builders were hindered by the collapse of theSuperflow, which was why it took them so long to get to Earth in the Builder War. To the Black Swan, the Builders were just dogs and there were even greater threats, such as theMapmakersand theBlack Priests. Worse was coming.[24]\n\nWhen theAvengersdepartedEarthin order to face theBuilders, an ancient and powerful race with the objective of destroying Earth,Thanosand hisBlack Ordertook advantage of the absence of Earth's Mightiest Heroes from the planet in order to raze it.[12]\nThanos' army invaded Earth, and the Black Order confronted theIlluminati, as one of Thanos's minions had gathered the information they had on the Infinity Gems. Black Panther managed to forceBlack Dwarfto withdraw, while Doctor Strange was embarked in a mental fight againstEbony Maw. Beast and the X-Men foughtCorvus GlaiveandSupergiant.Proxima Midnightconfronted Namor in the ruins of an Atlantis where its inhabitants were annihilated by an attack from Wakanda, part of a conflict caused by Namor's attack on Wakanda during theconflict between the Avengers and the X-Men. However, the Black Order left their different locations as soon as they discovered the Illuminati didn't have the Infinity Gems.Black Boltwas visited by Glaive in order to demand a tribute, the heads of Inhuman younglings between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two, or face the annihilation of Earth's inhabitants. Meanwhile, the Avengers allied themselves with theGalactic Counciland their first battle against the Builders proved a disaster, as numerous Avengers were captured in the process. Back on Earth, Black Bolt used theInhuman Codexto discover Thanos used the tribute demand as a cover for his true mission, to kill his secret Inhuman-descendant son whose identity and location were unknown even to his father.[15]\nWhen the Illuminati headed to numerous locations around the world whereThanos' sonmight have been, Doctor Strange found the boy in a secret Inhuman town in Greenland. But as he had been under the influence of Ebony Maw, Maw remained in the location and forced Strange to forget about the discovery, and to leave, now freed from Maw's control.[26]In Attilan, Black Bolt is confronted byThanoshimself, and the Inhuman city is destroyed during the battle. During the destruction of Attilan, Black Bolt took the opportunity to activate an Inhuman Bomb which spread theTerrigen Mistsupon the entire face of Earth.[17]As millions of Inhuman descendants suffer from Terrigenesis across Earth, including Thanos' son,Thane, Thanos defeated Black Bolt in combat in the ruins of Attilan.[4]\nAfter the Avengers won theBuilder War, theGalactic Councilinformed the Avengers that Earth had fallen to Thanos' invasion. In Greenland,  Maw posed as an ally and offeredThanea suit to control his powers, but also captured him in a containment field, followed by Maw alerting Thanos about the discovery of his descendant. Thanos and the rest of the Black Order arrived toWakanda, followingNamor's declaration that the Infinity Gems were there when he was forced to surrender by Proxima Midnight, and found inNecropolisthe Illuminati's hidden headquarters, along with theantimatter bombs, which they planned to use to destroy Earth by activating them using Black Bolt. After the Black Order exceptSupergiantdeparted Wakanda to go to Greenland, the Illuminati arrived with the help ofMaximusandLockjawand started fighting back Thanos' army. Meanwhile, the Avengers and their numerous allies begun approaching Earth.[22]\nAfter breaking thrown the barrier settled by Thanos' army around Earth with the help of the Galactic Council, the Avengers managed to arrive to Thanos' location and fight him and what was left of hisBlack Orderand freeThane, the son of Thanos, who his father had captured. When the Illuminati arrived to Necropolis and the room where the antimatter bombs were, they found themselves against Thanos' generalSupergiant, who defeated them by mentally controlling Black Bolt. When Supergiant activated the bombs,Maximusappeared with the trigger. He triggered the bombs, but also usedLockjawto transport the antimatter bomb along with Supergiant to a distant uninhabited planet where she died in the explosion. Back in the battle of the Avengers against Thanos, Ebony Maw double-crossed the Mad Titan and freed Thane to let him fight his father. Thanos, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive's glaive were trapped by Thane in an amber construct which left them in a state of \"living death.\"[25]"

He tries reasoning that Kang could've tried killing them all in their sleep, yet he wants them to save space-time. However, Hill informs him that Kang is completely insane, thinks he's \"Pharaoh\" of the world. They then enter a section of the building where the time machine is being constructed.

When they see the future Kang was describing,Spider-Mannotices that he exists in that time andSpider-Womansees that she has a child. They then see their children, theNext Avengers, murdering Immortus. If that, all time and space collapsed. The last image seen is the face of an elderlyHulkbefore the image vanishes.

But before they could utilize Noh's device to travel to the future, they are attacked byWonder Man, who screams that he warnedSteve Rogersnot to put the Avengers back together. He goes into a berserker rage and refusing to listen to reason, attacking his fellow Avengers. Noh-Varr is able to blast him out of the tower and into a nearby building. He then comes charging back, before disappearing, as soon as he collides with the tower, destroying Noh's machinery.Iron Man becomesconcerned, fearing that another Avenger, just like theScarlet Witchand theSentry, has snapped.

She finds him stuck in one of Spiders Man's illusions, and tries just about everything she can to pull him out of it, including beating on Spiders Man, (who only cries without moving). She finally gets the idea to bond with her father through hersymbiote(which is both the carnage and venom symbiotes reunited).\nAs they bond, she finds herself in her Spiders Man's illusion, which is a version ofNew Yorkwhere none of the mutations happened. She goes looking for her father and stumbles upon Spiders Man, who in the illusion has no mutation and therefore no power over the illusion he's currently casting. May learns that it's her father who is in control, and continues to search for him.\nMay finds her father hanging out withGwen Stacy,Harry Osborn, andMary Jane Watson(who was her mother before she died). Only, in this illusion,Captain George Stacynever died, which led to the arrest ofNorman Osborn, and in turn saved Gwen's life (since the Green Goblin didn't throw her off the bridge). All of this resulted inPeterand Gwen getting married as well as Harry and MJ ending up together. As she's learning all of this, Peter is interpreting May as a threat, and is chasing her out of their house and fighting her in New York, with May trying to convince him that this 'reality' he has created isn't real the entire time.\nPeter gives turns a corner, and Spider-Man turns back towards her. She assumes it's her father back in his webs, but is surprised when he takes off his mask and he'sBen Parker, son of Peter and Gwen. It's then that she realizes that this whole illusion is about him still being in love with Gwen, and that he never really wanted her mother or her (or so she thinks). The unbearable sadness of this causes her to break her bond with him, kicking her out of the illusion. She's so angry and upset about it she starts beating on Spiders Man again, who somehow comes out of the illusion as well.\nPeter comes to his senses and realizes how he hurt her shutting down the illusion on his own, and stopping her from beating Spiders Man senseless. As he's apologizing to May and explaining why everything happened, she's forgiving him, and together they ask Spiders Man to leave the Church and join their cause."

MGH can be extracted and isolated.\nThe Mutant Growth Hormone, or MGH, has been marketed and available even before the start of the super-hero age:Wilson Fiskhad access to it before he became a powerful crime lord[7]and it was also available beforeDr. Stephen Strangestudied magic[8]in the1960s.[9]\nAfter these events, biochemistDr. Henry McCoy, while working for theBrand CorporationonLong Island, developed an experimental serum that purportedly acted as a catalyst to activate latent mutations, with effects similar to the MGH. This may have been either a re-discovery of the MGH, or alternatively a different chemical compound.[10]\nYears later, an unknown party provided a crowd with an experimental drug that gave them powers similar to some popular super-humans such asThor,Cyclops, orDaredevil. The drug also made them extremely aggressive.Iron Manmanaged to control the situation. It is, however, unclear if this was exactly a release of MGH, or a similar drug.[11]\nStephen Strange, the man who would later become the hero Doctor Strange, used MGH from street dealers to try and control the pain in his hands after disfiguring them in a car accident.[8]\nThe MGH reached prominence when the mutate crime lord,Owlbegan refining his own genetic material to obtain a drug he could sell, trying to build a new criminal empire with the profits. Daredevil stopped him.[12]\nTheVanishersold \"designer genes\" on the black market -- later confirmed in a Marvel handbook to be MGH[13]-- until he was stopped by theX-Men.[14][15]\nMattie Franklinstrung out with her \"boyfriend\",Denny Haynes\nWiccandiscoveredPatriotinjecting Mutant Growth Hormone\nAt one point,Mattie Franklin, the thirdSpider-Woman, fell in with and was abducted by a man namedDenny Haynes. For weeks, Haynes kept Mattie high and sedated while harvesting her blood and tissue from a wound on her back. While strung out, Mattie entered the apartment ofJessica Jones, but quickly fled before she could be questioned. After the encounter, Jones began investigating Mattie's disappearance. Jones was able to rescue and return Mattie to her foster parents, theJamesons, after a team-up withJessica Drew, the originalSpider-Woman.[16]\nTheYoung Avenger,Patriotwas a regular user of MGH. Having no superpowers, he lied to his friends and teammates, claiming to have inherited hisgrandfather's powers via a blood transfusion. When his secret was revealed, Patriot was ashamed and quit the team.[17](He later rejoined the team after receiving an actual blood transfusion from his grandfather that did give him the powers of a trueSuper Soldier).[18]\nTheRunawaysand theNew Avengersfound some evidence of the superhero,Cloak, beating his partner,Dagger, which landed her in the hospital. However, after chasing Cloak, they discovered that the attack had been performed by orderlyReginald Mantzwho mimickedCloak's powerwith MGH.[19]\nAt some point, the TV documentary show60 Minutesran an episode about MGH.[20]\nDuring theCivil War,Wolverinediscovered that the super-villainNitroused MGH to increase his power level, which allowed him to annihilateStamford,Connecticut.[5]It was revealed that his provider was none other thanWalter Declun, the CEO ofDamage Control,[21]using Nitro to generate damages in order to create contracts for his business.[20]\nWhile trying to reverse the effects ofM-Daywhich robbed most of the world'smutantsof their powers andX-Genes,BeastandBishopshook down an MGH dealer,Charlie Hustle, to obtain active MGH samples. Unfortunately, they discovered like most mutants, most MGH lost its viability (Hustle possessed only viable samples ofWhirlwind, which he sold for a fortune).[22]\nTo convinceWeapon Omegato join theDark X-Men,Norman Osbornaffected a building site and a school with MGH gas, making all humans in those areas become temporary mutants, and possible targets for Omega's powers. According to a conversation betweenDark Beastand Norman, they had many active MGH samples left, and the resources to make it again.[23]\nDuring theFear, a few drug dealers used MGH on themselves to mimic the strength, size, and aura of Natives Americans devils to create a clash between the natives and their white neighbors. They were defeated by theAmerican Eagle. The origin of this MGH is unknown.[24]\nNot long afterDazzleraccepted a position as Mutant Liaison toS.H.I.E.L.D., she was abducted byMystique. Mystique masquerade as Dazzler while keeping the real Dazzler comatose onMadripoorand harvesting MGH from her for months.[25][26]She was eventually rescued byMagneto.[27]\nDuring a training session,Emma Frosttook youngJean Greyto Madripoor to break upBlob's MGH smuggling ring.[28]\nTodd Zillerwas a volunteer in the newSuper-Soldierprocess. They could not recreate the serum so they used existing transformative substances. The final result includedGammaenhancements, Mutant Growth Hormone,Pym Particles, and theConnors Formula. The resulting application of the serum in Ziller's body turned him into a giant reptile similar toGodzilla, for which he was given the alias of \"American Kaiju.\"[29]\n...[30]\nBlack Catpurchasing some ofDiamondback'sI.G.H.\n\nWhile it is most of the time extracted from mutants, it can also be extracted/synthesized from other super-powered individuals, but the source of their superpowers must alter their genetic make-up. For example,the OwlorSpider-Womanare not mutants, but their powers come from genetic mutations, and they were both used as MGH sources.[12][16]Recently, it appears to be derived fromInhumansand is often referred to as I.G.H.[3]\nThe MGH is a drug having effects on the superhuman capacities of the users and varies according to the user' initial abilities.\nMGH is known to be highly addictive[22][28]especially in baseline humans,[citation needed]and a known side effect of MGH use is increased aggression.[19][17]\nWhen used bybaseline humans, will result what's known as a\"temporary genetic shift\".[citation needed]In other words, it temporarily grants super powers[4][20]likeflight, fire breath,teleportation, orincreased strengthto its users.\nMost of the time, the powers are duplicates of those belonging to the donor, but results are known to vary.\nWhen MGH is used by a mutant or a metahuman, it increases the powers they already possess.[22][20]\nIt was described byNitroas\"steroids for powers\".[5]\nIn a related but different way,Magnetohad an MGH chemist produce for him a refined MGH of his own DNA, in order to grant him a higher level of power.[30]It is unclear if Magneto looked for the power-granting or the power-boosting effects of his own MGH.\nBlob, a depowered mutant, had his own powers (temporarily) restored thanks toDazzler's MGH.[26][31]\nMGH is most commonly available in tablet[5]or capsule[32]forms for oral ingestion. However, MGH can also be made available in a liquid form for intramuscular injection[33]or a gaseous form for inhalation.[23]\nInHouse of Mreality, MGH is used on vegetables, and those produces are recommended in order to obtain mutant offspring and are said to encourage a healthy gene stock.[34]\nMGH is an illegal drug.[28]Possession, trade and consumption is completely illegal in theUnited States.[citation needed]Other countries have passed similar laws.[citation needed]"

He was created as both use as an agent and as a potential prototype for the next generation of \"Super Sentinels\".[13]The product of a \"mating\" between his human \"Mother\" and a machine.[14]He is highly cunning, skilled in misdirection, and has a ship that is an extension of his nervous system namedE.V.A.Originally three-brained with mutated autonomous Nervous System; Later the embodiment of only one of those brains.[12]Adopting the name \"Jean-Phillipe Charles\", a French accent and a love forFrenchculture.[5]\nHis quasi-mutantstatus and rebellious nature lead him to join the mutant cause, joining theX-Men,[18]Magneto's team,[19]Cable'sX-Force,[15]and theX-Force Strike Team.[20]After he was killed E.V.A. deposited his body in a cloning chamber and all three of his brains were intact, and the machine mistakenly cloned a new body for each brain. One of them was a female version namedCluster,[12]and the third clone wasDark Fantomex, the cruellest of the three.[12]\nFantomex, orWeapon XIII, was a result of theWeapon Plus Program's experimentation with technological-human hybrids.[4]He was born and was artificially \"evolved\" inThe World, a man-made environment designed to createSuper-SoldiersusingSentineltechnology.[4][21]Though his true identity remained unknown, he had on at least one occasion gone by the name \"Jean-Phillipe,\"[8]and his experiment designation at The World facility was \"Charlie Cluster-7.\"[1]In terms of nationality, it was first assumed that Fantomex was French due to his heavy French accent and villa seemingly nearParis.[8]However, he explained that he was not French (further adding to his mysterious origin), but rather spoke with a French accent because he found that it annoyed and distracted others when speaking to him,[1][22]and also because he liked that accent.[6]\nFantomex sought a safe haven at theX-Corporationin Paris while fleeing from authorities. He claimed to be amutantthief with the ill-defined power of misdirection and Superhuman intellect later on.[3]Bleeding profusely from bullet wounds, he asked for asylum, whichProfessor Xgranted him. Fantomex explained to Professor X andJean Greythat he was being hunted because he was one of the most wanted thieves inEurope. Neither Professor X nor Jean Grey were able to use their telepathy to verify his claims due to his ceramic mask, a device that blocked their mental probes.[8]\nHowever, they agreed to aid him, and after escaping the soldiers who surrounded the building, Fantomex usedE.V.A.to take Professor X and Jean Grey to his \"home\" in France.[8]While there, he introduced them tohis \"mother\"and continued to describe his success as a thief. In fact, he told the two that he had stolen sensitive information about the Weapon Plus project while in theChunnel, and offered to sell it to Professor Xavier for one billion dollars. After submitting his proposal, he put himself in a light hypnotic trance and removed the bullets that riddled his body. Finished, he asked Professor X and Jean Grey to accompany him back to the Chunnel in an effort to destroyWeapon XII. The three left in E.V.A., leaving the house and elderly woman behind.[8]However, both the house and the woman turned out to be a highly elaborate ruse designed by Fantomex to hide his true origin.[4]\nFantomex then led Professor Xavier and Jean Grey to the Chunnel disaster. Packed full of people and animals that Weapon XII had turned into mindless slaves, confusion ran rampant. Knowing that those who had fallen prey to Weapon XII's influence were lost, Fantomex killedDarkstarand any others who were mentally connected to the creature. After Fantomex destroyed Weapon XII by using a remote detonator, it was noticed that there were two empty Weapon Plus transport tubes in the Chunnel: one that had held the violent Weapon XII and another that held something called Weapon XIII.[4]\nAfter the battle, Fantomex's ceramic mask slipped a bit and Jean Grey used her telepathy to deduce his true identity: Fantomex was actually Weapon XIII and had also been in transit in the Chunnel. It was during the accident in the Chunnel that he had escaped and was subsequently chased to the X-Corporation building. He confessed to Jean Grey that he was not the master thief that he had claimed, but was now set out to earn that reputation. He assured Jean Grey that he refused to be anyone's soldier, and as a result Jean Grey allowed Fantomex to disappear into the Chunnel before the authorities arrived.[4]\nFantomex saves Dust\nFantomex later traveled toAfghanistanin an attempt to steal a list of theEarth's richest mutant slaver traders, the names on which he intended to blackmail. There he encountered an unconscious mutant known asDust, a former mutant captive who had unwittingly killed her captors by turning into a deadly sandstorm. Upon his exit, he encounteredWolverine, leaving Dust in his care.[23]\nSoon after, Fantomex contacted Wolverine and offered him information about his mysterious past if he helped Fantomex destroyUltimaton, also known as Weapon XV, a deadly product of the Weapon Plus program. Fantomex, Wolverine, and theX-Men'sCyclopstraveled to The World, an artificial, time-altering environment designed by the Weapon Plus program to quickly develop and evolve new generations of super-soldiers.[21]The team was defeated by Ultimaton, who escaped by breaking through the barriers of The World and flying to the Weapon Plus space station.[1]\nThe team pursued their target in E.V.A., Fantomex's biological spacecraft, and upon arriving at the space station Fantomex kept his word by showing Wolverine the complete Weapon Plus database. Shocked at learning the terrible details of his past (including his slaughtering of the entire population of Roanoke while under the influence of the Weapon Plus Program), Wolverine initiated the self-destruct sequence for the space station before catching and ultimately killing Ultimaton, who was also wondering about his condition.[24]Fantomex and Cyclops escaped the explosion in one of the station's shuttles.[25]\nReturning to Earth to find the X-Men scattered andManhattanunder siege bya mutantimpersonating their arch-foeMagneto, Cyclops recruited Fantomex, E.V.A., and a group ofXavier Institutestudents into an ad-hoc X-Men team to oppose the villain. Fantomex led the assault, cutting a path through the faux-Magneto’sBrotherhoodand liberating Xavier, precipitating the villain’s downfall.[26]\nResuming his crusade against Weapon Plus, Fantomex found the grave of the Program's director,John Sublime, but found it empty, except for a slip of paper bearing the word “Roanoke.” He located the secret facility of the splinter programWeapon Xand found it abandoned except for Weapon X’sAgent Zero. After a brief scuffle with no clear victor, the pair reluctantly joined forces and traveled to the site ofRoanoke, a town whose inhabitants were slaughtered after Weapon X unleashed a brainwashed Wolverine on them years earlier. There, they encountered Sublime but were opposed by hisU-Menand forced to flee against overwhelming odds. Believed to still be under the Program’s control, Fantomex was left for dead.[citation needed]\nLater, Fantomex was contacted by the diminutive mutantShortpackwho sought his help in assassinating mutant arms dealerSteinbeckin revenge for his killing of an agent under Shortpack’s care.[27]Fantomex refused, not wanting to become responsible for allowing the good-natured Shortpack to become a killer. Shortpack was captured by Steinbeck soon after, and whilst investigating his disappearance the shape changing mutantMystique, who was working for both Xavier and Steinbeck's allyShepard, learned of his meeting with Fantomex. Though despising him after a past encounter inMadagascar, Mystique found Fantomex inMonte Carlo, once again operating under the pretense he was a mutant thief, and learned of Shortpack’s plan.[citation needed]\nAs she left to rescue him, Fantomex followed and uncovered her intent to assassinate Xavier. In exchange for his silence, Fantomex bade Mystique perform a heist for him. After she returned with the goods, Mystique infected both Fantomex and E.V.A. with a techno-organic virus, seemingly killing them both to keep her plan secret. However, it was all a ruse as Mystique knew she was being monitored by Shepard. Fantomex later resurfaced and helped Mystique capture Shepard, giving her access to Steinbeck whom she defeated.[citation needed]\nFantomex next appeared defending The World fromNorman Osborn's zombie hordes. After Wolverine and the zombie soldiers were infected byAllgod. As atheists, Fantomex andNoh-Varrwere immune to the World's latest weapon. Fighting off the zombies and a mind controlled Wolverine, Noh-Varr manages to placate the World, releasing Wolverine from the Allgod's influence. The trio then proceed to defeat Norman Osborne's zombies. Fantomex used a shrink-ray stolen fromDoctor Doomto keep an eye on the World.[28]\nFantomex hunts down a Predator X\nNext encountering the X-Men after being hired by a young mutant boy to kill aPredator X, Fantomex was crucial in helping to subdueLobe'steamuntil they released a mutant-specific influenzaHX-N1, forcing the X-Men to flee. Fantomex was later seen wooingPsylocke.[29]\nOnce part of the X-Men, he helpedEmma FrostandKitty Prydeget rid ofSebastian Shaw, but he released him from the pair, thinking to kill him but instead powering his kinetic absorption power, which led Shaw to battle the three X-Men for a short but intense confrontation.[30]\nHe was later seen fighting theNimrodsentinel units sent from the future byBastionto attack the mutants ofUtopia.[citation needed]\nHe then joinedX-Force.[20]He went with the team on a mission to kill a clone ofthe original Apocalypse. The team was shocked to find that the clone was a child. The rest of the team argued, but not bring themselves to kill the boy. Fantomex, believing the child was beyond saving, took matters into his own hands and killed him.[31]\nLater, an army ofDeathloksattacked Fantomex, killed his mother, and stole the miniaturized World, wherein Fantomex was working on an experiment he believed would save the world. It was later discovered that this was another clone of Apocalypse created by Fantomex, namedGenesis, being grown in his lab in The World.[32]\nDue to killing Apocalypse, X-Force memberArchangelbegan to turn into the newApocalypsebecause of the Succession Protocol put in place to assure that upon Apocalypse's death, one of his Horsemen of Death would succeed him. X-Force traveled to theAge of Apocalypse, an alternate universe where they hoped to find a CelestialLife Seedwhich they could use to reverse the process Archangel was undergoing.[33]\nTogether with theX-Menof that world they managed to secure a Life Seed despite heavy losses for the X-Men. They returned to their own world only to find that they had been tricked by Archangel who had already completed his transformation and wanted the Life Seed in order to re-make The World. Fantomex and X-Force attempted to fight him and hisHorsemenbut were forced to flee, leaving behind Psylocke, who still believed Archangel could be redeemed.[34]\nWith Wolverine seriously injured Fantomex was forced to lead what remained of X-Force in order to stop Archangel and retrieve The World which he had stolen. During the final battle to stop Archangel, Fantomex appeared to flee but in fact went to bring the AoA X-Men as back-up. Fantomex was also forced to release his secret weapon, the clone of Apocalypse, who managed to buy them enough time to defeat Archangel.[35]\nFantomex was then kidnapped byCaptain Britainand taken toOtherworldto stand trial for his murder of the child Apocalypse. After Otherworld was attacked and Fantomex helped in its defense, however, he was allowed to go free.[36]\nFantomex returns\nAs X-Force came face to face with the newBrotherhood of Evil Mutants, Fantomex was poisoned by Mystique with a poison that completely blocked his powers. Psylocke was mind controlled byShadow Kingforcing Fantomex to intervene. He removed his mask which contained his mind shields and gave it to Psylocke, breaking Shadow King's control over her. This, however, left him vulnerable and after just managing to send Psylocke away with E.V.A., he was killed by the Brotherhood.[37]\nE.V.A. and the rest of X-Force managed to recover his body and E.V.A. deposited it in a cloning sample hatch in theWhite SkyFacility, the Cloud. All three of his brains were intact, and the machine made a mistake and cloned a new body for each of his brains. Fantomex reunited with Psylocke and took her and his new \"sister\" to meet his mother.[12]\nFantomex and Cluster escaping after a heist\nFantomex, Cluster, and Psylocke worked as thieves in Paris, six months after their reconstitution, Cluster learning the job from Fantomex. During this time a love triangle emerged between Fantomex, Psylocke, and Cluster, until Weapon XIII kidnapped Fantomex. While trying to rescue Fantomex, Weapon XIII professed his love for Psylocke, this lead to all three of them agreeing to become one again.[38]Fantomex was even offered a spot by Wolverine in theJean Grey School, which he turned down.[39]\nFantomex and E.V.A. joinedCable's newX-Forceteam and went on several missions with them in the hopes he'd be reunited with his still as of yet dissociated parts of himself.[40]After a time, he slowly went insane and plotted against the team wanting to be the best there is.[41]Eventually turning on them he also revealed that team member MeMe was really Hope using her powers to impersonatethe real one.[42]Using her to copy the imperfect Volga Effect onto himself in digital form in order to complete his flawed being only to find it useless, untilDominoshot him in the head did the serum take full effect giving him full control over it bestowing upon himself a wide range of new abilities.[43]\nFor a time, Fantomex would travel across the globe, deposing every branch of super spy agency, super people coalitions, super anything that stood in his path to being the best which unbeknownst to him was a clever ploy by Nathan himself to demolish any threats to the mutant nation agenda.[44]Hope Summers eventually copied his god-like powers and instead of fighting him directly, she implanted a thought into his mind: that in order to be perfect you need inadequacies and personal faults. Fantomex couldn't comprehend being perfect through imperfection so he had a mental break down, having E.V.A. purge himself of all flaws afflicting him along with his almighty attributes. Psylocke then used her psychic blades to scramble his brains seemingly clipping his connection to his core mutant power, wherein the rest of X-Force proceeded to paste the now depowered perfectionist.[45]\nBoth Fantomex and E.V.A. were restored to normalcy byMagneto,[19]who subsequently had Jean-Phillipe work for him through theHellfire Club, investigating the activities of a shady company calledSomeday Enterprisestogether with Mystique.[46]After discovering that Someday used biotechnology stolen from The World in their experiments with mutants, Fantomex entered its system to ensure it was no longer compromised. Upon finding Someday's access point into The World and destroying it, Fantomex took advantage of the void left by it to plant the seed of his very own own consciousness in The World's network.[47]\nUpon returning to the real world, Fantomex became partners withGambituntil being paid the money LeBeau owed him. When Gambit was psychically called by Psylocke to London for help, Fantomex accompanied him. After helping free Psylocke from the influence of the Shadow King, some of the mutants summoned by Psylocke ventured into theAstral Planeto defeat the villain. Fantomex volunteered, on the grounds that he needed to ensure Gambit's safety only so he could pay his debt.[48]\nThe team eventually split up in once they reached the Astral Plane, and Fantomex ended up with Mystique. Mystique took advantage of the properties of the Astral Plane to conjure upMadripoorand essentially enjoy a vacation while they waited for the Shadow King to come for them. Fantomex and Mystique enjoyed numerous activities together, eventually sharing a kiss before being teleported elsewhere in the Astral Plane by the soul of the late Professor X to help him fight the Shadow King.[49]Near the end of the conflict, Fantomex agreed to donate his body to Professor X's astral form so that he could return to the real world while his mind remained in the Astral Plane. Fantomex hoped his sacrifice would earn him a clean slate and break his cycle of always returning to his status quo of a thief, a role he felt he was chained to.[50]\nSome time before his passing and the loan of corporeality to X, Charlie had investigated Weapon Plus. In the event of his demise, Fantomex left a recorded memoir of himself detailing his trail and leads on uncovering the clandestine super-soldier sanction within his neurological biome partner E.V.A., who would later seek out and find other Weapon program initiates to continue his quest.[51]\nFantomex is an artificially-evolved human, an engineered mutate with three brains for independent parallel processing and 'nano-active blood'.[24]Fantomex's primary nervous system is actually a detachable techno-organism called E.V.A.[1]\nAfter being killed, he was cloned in a way that his three brains each received a body, leading to the existence ofFantomex,Cluster, andWeapon XIII. Later, the clones were thought to have been reabsorbed back into his original body but this was not the case. He is also amutant.[15]\nSelf-Power Bestowal/Volga Effect:After having pirated a copy of Hope Summer's affliction who in turn had copied the fatal chemical augment from her strickenfather, Fantomex managed to fabricate a digitized version of what ails them both.[61]Rewriting it to enabling him use of its empowering effects without self-destructing but also bestowing and developing whole new powers on the fly onto himself whenever he pleases.[62]\nFantomex gets ready for a fight\nFantomex is a skilled marksman and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. He can also read the body language of others with unparalleled precision. This, coupled with his superhuman abilities, makes him a master of misdirection. Fantomex is also able to place himself in a state of light auto-hypnosis to perform critical tasks, such as self surgery.[8]"

The Apocalypse Twins inform the Scarlet Witch that they want her to cast a spell which will lift all of mutantkind to safety - to Planet X. They reveal to her that in this timeline, she is the weapon used to destroy Earth’s heroes, and that the rapture, taking the mutants to Planet X, is the only way to stop it. The Scarlet Witch refuses to have any part in the Apocalypse Twins’ plan, but they kneel before her, and reveal that they have a weapon to help boost her power should she change her mind.

He killed the Red Skull without the use of his mutant gifts, offering him a \"pure\" death, but also unleashed a more powerful persona of the Red Skull - theRed Onslaught.[7]\nThe Red Onslaught used his powers to spread hate across the world, unleashing a \"World War Hate\" which even affected theAvengers. OnceIron Mansnapped them out of the telepathically-induced fit of rage using a telepathic inhibitor, they located the source of the attack and arrived to Genosha to assist Magneto, Rogue and the Scarlet Witch, bringing reinforcement in the form of both X-Men fractions and other allies. Iron Man used a telepathic tamperer to stop the Skull's influence. When more heroes arrived to help, the Red Skull revealed that he had influenced Stark to create a model ofSentinels, based on the knowledge of different superheroes he acquired after theCivil War, before erasing the latter's memories of constructing them. The villain then deployed hisStark Sentinelsto fight the heroes.[8]\nWith the appearance of the Stark Sentinels, the tide of the battle was quickly turned to the Red Onslaught's favor. Using their opponents' own strengths against themselves, the Sentinels countered the heroes, bathing them inPym Particlesto shrink them and hold them prisoners. Rogue came up with a plan to defeat the Skull, proposing that Doctor Strange and the Scarlet Witch cast a spell to invert the axis of Skull's brain and bring out the fragment ofCharles Xavierto defeat Onslaught. The plan failed due toNova's inexperience, and the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange were targeted and captured by the Sentinels before they could cast the spell. As Magneto fled from the battle, the heroes hid in Genosha, hidden with the help ofQuentin Quire. After coming to, Iron Man organized a last attempt to defeat the Sentinels, but failed and was left the last one standing. The Red Skull told him he had seen into his mind, and that he was a sociopath fueled by competition, but his boast is interrupted by the return of Magneto. Magneto is accompanied by a group of villains he had recruited to fight the Sentinels, as the robots were not able to properly counter villains as well as heroes.[9]\nThe villains managed to defeat one of the Sentinels, which allowed the heroes trapped inside to break free.Doctor Doomand the Scarlet Witch attempted to cast the inversion spell again, and the Red Skull was knocked unconscious and reverted from his Red Onslaught form. The other Sentinel was defeated afterwards, freeing the heroes inside, but not before the villains had left the scene. Before the Skull could wake up to reveal whether Charles Xavier was now in control or not, as the X-Men wanted, the Avengers decided to be cautious and take the Red Skull toStark Tower. This caused Havok to resign from the Unity Division and side with the now-unified two teams of X-Men and his brother, with whom he reconciled.[10]\nDays later,S.H.I.E.L.D.gatheredCaptain Americato discuss what was going to be of the Red Skull, now that the Stark Sentinels had been dismantled and the concentration camps torn down.Nick Furytried to convince Sam to hand him over, but under the influence of the inversion spell, Wilson was violent and punched him before leaving. Meanwhile, inBrooklyn, a family held hostage was saved from theSquidby the now-heroicCarnage.Spider-Manarrived to the scene shortly after Cletus had left, and to his surprise, found the family unharmed, as well as the villain. InSan Francisco, Iron Man arrived to the Giants Stadium where he presented his new digital version of theExtremis, free for every citizen of the city to achieve perfection.Matt Murdockwas among the crowd, and noticed something was off with Tony, who had also started drinking once more. At theJean Grey School, the X-Men were revealing the unification of mutants as they also revealed their new agenda of no longer seeking coexistence betweenhumansand mutants, but to stand above them, with the help ofEvan Sabahnur, who had becomeApocalypsedue to the inversion. Back at the Avengers Tower, Captain America informed the team about the current movements of the X-Men, leading them to decide to execute the Red Skull, and any opportunity of Charles Xavier still being alive inside their shared brain, in response to the mutant's claims. Both theHulkandJarvistried to stop them, but were ignored and attacked. This caused a new persona to surface, the inverted Hulk,Kluh, who proceeded to attack the Avengers before fleeing the Tower, stating his desire to cause destruction. After deciding that Kluh was not their problem as long as he didn't stand in their way, the Avengers opened the Skull's cell, only to find it empty.[11]\nFollowing the Skull's escape, Captain America called a meeting in the Avengers Tower of all the heroes available who were or had been Avengers. After informing the guests of the Red Skull's disappearance, Sam Wilson told them that only somebody with Avengers clearance could have been able to have done that, making everyone in the room a suspect. Spider-Man's spider-sense triggered, and quickly escaped the Tower through the window along with Nova as Captain America activated a button which sprayed all the heroes in the room with Pym Particles, in order to send them toHank Pym's \"ant farms.\" Spider-Man and Nova were chased by theAxis of Evil Avengers, but escaped with the help of Magneto, who took them to theAvengers Mansion, whereSteve Rogersinformed them about the effects of the inversion, including the rampage of Kluh acrossArizona. After Nova took off to confront Kluh, who was approaching his hometown, a massive airship appeared aboveNew York, carrying the inverted X-Men. The inverted X-Men arrived to the Avengers Tower where they beat up Captain America, the only one present, so he would give the inhabitants of New York a message: every human was to evacuateManhattanwithin the next three hours or be slaughtered, as the island was going to be the first prize of the mutant uprising because of its importance to humanity, and mutants would take everything they cared about.[12]\nAfter broadcasting their warning to humankind, the X-Men, who had created a gene bomb designed to kill everyone on Earth without aX-Genein their body, were confronted byMystique, who attempted to make them see the errors of their ways.RogueandNightcrawlerconfronted her, and forced her to leave withSabretooth. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, Daredevil confronted Tony Stark about unleashing Extremis, and the problems it caused to society. Tony surprised Matt with increased agility and strength, and beat him up before throwing him from his headquarters. InLatveria, Doctor Doom admitted to a crowd that he was but a man in the eyes ofGodand claimed his desire to try democracy on Latveria before he was attacked by the Scarlet Witch, who wanted revenge for having tampered with her and indirectly causing theHouse of M. He was saved byQuicksilverand Magneto, who stated Wanda would never recover from killing Doom if she did so. InLas Vegas,Lokitried to unsuccessfully make his brotherOdinsonlisten to reason, and had to be saved by Steve Rogers,Nomad, and Spider-Man in theQuinjet. After returning with Loki to the Avengers Mansion, Steve revealed that he had assembled the solution to deal with the Axis and X-Men: he had reassembled the team of inverted super villains into theAstonishing Avengers.[13]\nAs the Astonishing Avengers stormed Apocalypse's ship and fought the X-Men,Zenpooland Spider-Man attempted to sneak past Apocalypse and try to defuse the gene bomb. Zenpool attempted to distract Apocalypse while Spider-Man deactivated the device, but both failed and were thrown outside the ship, where they joined the ongoing battle between the X-Men and the Avengers. Meanwhile, in Latveria, the Scarlet Witch unleashed her power to fight Doom, and seemingly killed both Quicksilver and Magneto, as well as discovering she actually had no blood ties with the Master of Magnetism since a curse she cast on members of her bloodline only affected her brother, before forcing Doctor Doom to flee. In San Francisco, Captain America arrived at Iron Man's Stark Island, where the Armored Avenger introduced him to the reassembled Axis, willing to join forces once again upon learning Steve Rogers was looking for the Red Skull to reverse the inversion. Back in Manhattan, Zenpool kept trying to reason with Apocalypse, but in the end he was beaten and beheaded, thus defeated like the rest of the Astonishing Avengers. As Apocalypse claimed his victory, the gene bomb's countdown was almost finished.[14]\nWith no options left, Carnage used thesymbioteto wrap around the bomb and contain the explosion, sacrificing himself in the process. Soon after Spider-Man confronted the X-Men for the death of Carnage, the Axis arrived on the scene and began fighting the X-Men. During the fight, Loki distracted Thor, and tricked him into following him into a portal to theMoon. In the Avengers Mansion, Steve Rogers and Nomad were watching the fight when Jarvis entered, announcing that he knew a way to stop them. Meanwhile, in Latveria, the Scarlet Witch began destroyingDoomstadt, as the defeated Quicksilver and Magneto tried to convince her not to do so. Doctor Doom returned with the resurrectedDoctor Voodoo, who used the spirit of his brotherDanielto possess the Scarlet Witch and try to defeat her. In the Avengers Mansion, Nomad received a message from Steve, who had equipped himself with his oldExoskeletonandEnergy Shield, that he was going to free the Red Skull. This piece of information was intercepted by Iron Man, who informed Captain America about it, and both set out to go to the Avengers Tower, where the Red Skull had been all along; he hadn't been freed, Jarvis had merely used one of Stark's cloaking devices to hide him from the murderous Avengers. When Sam entered the building, he encountered Steve holding the Red Skull, threatening Sam to stand down or face him.[15]\nUsing the Red Skull's telepathy, Steve managed to distract Sam for long enough to escape. After Cap's failure to capture Rogers and the Skull, the Axis set out to the Avengers Mansion after having defeated the inverted X-Men. While recovering from his defeat, Apocalypse was confronted by Zenpool's head and convinced to fight against the Axis. On the Moon, Loki was being chased by Odinson around theBlue Area. The trickster soon came acrossMjolnir, which had been left there since Thorbecame unworthy. He picked up the hammer, and started fighting Odinson with the power of Thor. Back at the Avengers Mansion, Steve and the Skull were attacked by the Axis right after arriving. Before Cap could beat Rogers to death, Apocalypse appeared and fought the Axis while the Skull was taken from the location. The rest of the Axis still managed to catch up with them, but were confronted by Spider-Man and Sabretooth while Rogers tried to get the Skull to a Quinjet, which was soon foiled by Iron Man. Iron Man was about to kill the Red Skull when Doctor Doom, Scarlet Witch (possessed by Daniel Drumm), Magneto, Doctor Voodoo, and Quicksilver arrived. After Iron Man was incapacitated, Doom and Daniel began a reinversion spell and the Skull broadcasted it to those inverted, having only the options to either reinvert all the heroes and the villains or none of them. Unwilling to return to his regular self, Iron Man activated a shield to protect himself from the reinversion, accidentally shielding Havok and Sabretooth from the effect as well. The reinversion was successful, and every person affected by the inversion, except the three aforementioned, were returned to their regular selves. After the spell, the still-inverted Havok used theWaspas leverage to escape. Magneto soon realized that due to the distraction, Iron Man, Doctor Doom, and the Red Skull had also escaped."

Wolverine tells Cap that Avalanche was reformed and that he doesn't believe he'd be capable of something like this. Captain America agrees, saying that his eyes were vacant. Thor declares that he will no longer stand idly by and watch humans and mutants fight each other anymore.\nCap tells Wolverine that Havok has agreed to lead the squad and appeal to the mutant and human communities. Wolverine dismises the idea, saying that there is no such thing as a mutant community and that it's just the same nonsense Cyclops was spouting. He appears to change his mind however, when an elderly human who Havok saved gives Havok a hug and tells him he doesn't care what they say about mutants.\nMeanwhile, the Red Skull is appearing on television and using his telepathic powers to make humans kill mutants all over the world. Meanwhile, Rogue is approached by her captors, two of whom have arrived to feed her. Rogue manages to steal Dancing Water's powers and teleports away.\nMeanwhile, Red Skull watches over the sleeping form of the Scarlet Witch and contemplates that despite the fact that she is a mutant, gypsy, and a jew, she is beautiful and deceptively human. He wakes her and she attempts to fight him off. He remarks that what she did when trying to save Rogue was remarkably brave, and tells her that he learned of her father's mutant powers during the war, but that he was distracted by duty before he could focus his attentions on him. He shows Wanda his \"School for Gifted Humans\" and tells her that he believes they have interjecting interests, like her attempt to erase mutantkind. Wanda tells him that she'll never share any insights with the likes of him.\nSkull explains that for him, 1942 was mere months ago and that Arnim Zola recorded his consciousness in a cloned body, which was preserved in a safe bunker to be awakened 70 years later. Skull woke to find the climate in America to be very similar to that before the rise of Nazi Germany and that mutants were the ultimate scapegoats for a country looking for someone to blame. Wanda attempts to excuse what she did, but the Red Skull uses Xavier's powers to brainwash her, and she tells him that with enough casting time and an immense source of power, she can erase mutantkind again.\nSkull is interrupted by a telepathic missive, telling him that Rogue has escaped. As he goes to find her, Rogue appears and attacks Wanda. A fight breaks out, but after accidentally fighting their way into the location of Xavier's brainless corpse, Wanda snaps out of her mind-controlled state. Rogue remembers how Xavier stood up for her against the rest of the X-Men when she first joined, and vows to kill the Red Skull. They are interrupted by the arrival of the Red Skull and his team.\n• What are The Red Skull’s new powers? How did he become the most powerful man on Earth?\n• Can Havok and Thor defeat the spreading influence of Honest John, The Living Propaganda?!\n• Rogue and Scarlet Witch trapped on the Isle of the Red Skull’s S-Men!"

Anna Maria thinks he's joking but then sees that \"Peter\" is missing, not realizing he just jumped into action as Spider-Man. While he's seeking Lamaze, he's called by hisSpiderlingsabout Stunner's attack in thecity. Otto decides to confront her personally and once he arrives, he gets a full assault from her, and Stunner screams her motives: to avenge the death of her beloved Otto Octavius (since she doesn't know that Otto is now inhabitingSpider-Man's body). Meanwhile, at Potter's Field,Carlie Coopervisits the tomb of Otto Octavius, now knowing the full truth about the mindswitch, and reminisces about how Peter died as a hero but no one knew. Suddenly, the ground crumbles underneath her, revealing that the body is missing and she is then kidnapped by agreen-skinned assailant.\nStunner's assault against Spider-Man continues, with Otto trying to talk her out of attacking but she refuses to listen, bent on making her revenge complete, forcing Otto to wrap her in his new enhanced spider-web, buying some time to send his Spiderbots to track the source of Stunner's VR Interface and shut it down, although once Otto leaves, she easily escapes. Otto returns to E.S.U. to find Lamaze, who is talking with Anna Maria. Otto adjusts his earpiece to listen in on their conversation, hearing Anna Maria determined to convince Lamaze that \"Peter\" is not doing anything wrong and is one of the smartest men she ever knew, making Otto discover how much she understands him. Suddenly his Spider-Sense alerts him of a bus flying by after it was launched by Stunner, heading straight into Lamaze and Anna Maria, but Otto catches it with a thick layer of his Spider-Web in time to save them, which unfortunately leaves him open to Stunner's assault, who goes as far as tearing his mechanical legs apart. Stunner attacks Spider-Man, wanting him to beg for mercy and avenge Otto's death, but in the nick of time, theSpiderbotsmanage to shut down Angelina's interface.\nAfter the attack, Otto arrives to the secret lab, finding Angelina unconscious, managing to take away her Virtual Reality System. Once she wakes up, she is shocked to see Otto Octavius in person, just the way she knew him, not realizing that Otto is using the same method of Stunner by making his own \"Doctor Octopus\" avatar, however, Otto tells Angelina that he moved on while she was in a coma, but he'll always care for her. Afterwards, Otto visits Lamaze, who the next day drops all his accusations against \"Peter\". After they leave, Lamaze reveals to \"Peter\" that Otto Octavius visited him and revealed that it was \"Peter\" who gave Otto all the ideas for his inventions. \"Peter\" asks him to keep it a secret to avoid hurting Otto's ego, and Lamaze and Anna Maria congratulate him for his earned doctorate.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:"

A demon-looking yet good-natured young person, Nightcrawler was a \"bamfer\" (teleporter), a fugitive, a circus freak, and a Roman Catholic man of God that would even become a priest at one point. Tragically, Nightcrawler would die trying to save the Mutant Messiah - Hope Summers - from the wrath of the now-also dead Bastion. But threeEarth-1218years later... that will all change. What if Nightcrawler could come back from the afterlife?\nFollowing the Battle of the Atom, Wolverine and his X-Men will figure it out themselves, with Firestar now at their side. Nightcrawler, now lonesomely residing in Heaven despite enjoying it there, keeps on thinking he has unfinished business on Earth. He is then attacked there by his father, Azazel, who uses his connection to Kurt to get into paradise. He finds a way via the Bamfs to contact the Jean Grey X-Men and does so. Knowing they can also resurrect him and bring him back to the school to combat Cyclops, some of them - Wolverine, Northstar, Storm, Iceman, and Firestar - go immediately."

Otto admits that the mini-slayers were clever but inadvertly reveals that his countermeasures are being powered by the Raft's Power Generators, distracting him at the revelation so Smythe takes the upper hand until he's narrowly shot down by a Raft guard, revealed to be Jameson.\nOtto accuses Jonah of leaving the force field but Jameson confronts Spider-Man to tell him he brought him to ensure that Smythe gets executed by any means necessary, implying that he's giving permission to Spider-Man to directly kill him. Otto accepts and tells Jonah to go back to the force field with the others. Meanwhile, the group discuss that the Avengers should be warned of what's happening but Norah replies that before she arrived, theBuglemade a report about them marching into space, as well as commenting that if Spider-Man made sure no one leaves the Raft, no one might get in as well, asking what would happen if they're still alive in the event that the force field's power runs out.\nSpider-Man hunts Smythe through his comm system, only to discover that he did the same trick and informed his allies, all heading for a full front assault against Spider-Man, who tries to convince them that Smythe is using them and will take back their enhancements once he's out, but all of them agree that even though that might happen, they'll make the best of the situation against him. Smythe manages to reach the Raft's generators, destroying them to shut down the power in the entire island, allowing the last remaining prisoner, theLizard, to escape; but once Smythe tries to escape, Otto reminds him about the emergency generators, but Smythe warns Spider-Man that, just like he does with his Spider-Bots, he can see through his Mini-Slayers, catching up on Jameson and the trapped civilians, sending their locations to the group. Scorpion rejects it at first, but is easily convinced once Smythe tells him that one of his targets is Jameson himself. Scorpion heads for Jonah, Vulture aims at the civilians and Boomerang stays to fight against Spider-Man, who stops him by blocking his bomb-a-rangs with his webbing, escaping the resulting blast in the process (and possibly killing Boomerang).\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:"

In order to commemorate the life cut too short that he was forced to live, Aunt May decides to plan a small get-together amongst the people closest to her late nephew in the house they once lived in, and sends the invitations out.\nMiles Morales and Ganke get to the house on bus when Miles notices a small present Ganke has with him. He asks what it is, and finally gets Ganke to say that it is a Lego set that he intends to give to Gwen Stacy. Miles immediately protests, claiming he is too old for Legos and too young for Gwen, but Ganke is confident that nothing will go wrong. Mary JaneWatson arrives at the house later and simply stands out in front of it. Her new boyfriend, Liam, asks what is wrong, and she says she has just realized that this is an important event, and that he probably shouldn't come. He agrees with her, kisses her on the cheek, and leaves. As MJ goes inside, it becomes clear by her expression that she does not like Liam and still desires Peter. Meanwhile, Firestar is going over to the get-together when Iceman sees her and stops her. Firestar says she somewhat does not want to go, since Peter's demise makes her sad. They go together when the Human Torch sees them and goes along with them. Due to the fire powers of two of the three, Iceman starts to melt and falls to the pavement below, but assures he is fine.\nAs Miles and Ganke come into the house, Miles hugs May and talks with her a bit by saying that he feels weird being here considering that he never knew Peter personally, looking at Ganke the whole time. Ganke goes over to Gwen and gives her the present, saying that he saw they both liked something while screwing around on Facebook (what exactly it is is not revealed), and subsequently made the Lego for her. To everyone's shock, she kisses Ganke on the lips and takes it up to display it in her room while being congratulated by Bobby. The doorbell rings, and May opens it to find Pepper Potts outside. Apparently, Tony Stark was not able to make it to the get-together, but subsequently has delivered countless culinary items from a top chef in exchange, much to May's overwhelming. As everyone just stares at the food, the doorbell rings again, and Kitty Pryde comes in. She hugs Miles, and everyone talks about how she just received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Gwen is relieved, as her defeating Galactus might mean that mutants finally get the credit they deserve, although Liz and Johnny are less sure. Kong then arrives, and Kitty immediately goes to talk to him. The others comment on how they haven't seen him in so long. J. Jonah Jameson then arrives, but immediately regrets coming and decides to head back to the city.\nAfter finally finishing the meal, and awkward silence comes upon everyone. Mary Jane decides to bring up what Peter would be like if he was still alive. She decides to bring up a very vivid dream that she had involving such a scenario. After talking about her run-in with Nick Fury, she mentions how she imagines him being the greatest superhero in existence, leading the Ultimates 10 to 15 years from now.\nAunt May says that for a while, she hoped that he would eventually go back to science like his parents, but decided it was unlikely. Instead, she hoped he would merge the two loves, creating new ways to fight crime for both the police and other super heroes.\nGwen mentions that Peter was haunted by the fact that men like the Kingpin could escape justice because they were rich and connected, and reminisces that Peter used to say that he wished he was a full-fledged reporter so that he could use his life as Spider-Man to break stories other reporters couldn't, putting men like the Kingpin behind bars.\nMiles imagines himself as Peter's sidekick and goes on to say that he did not know Peter all that well, but thinks about the fact that he got his powers before Peter died, and wonders what would have happened if he tried to take up the mantle before Peter's death, speculating that he might have become Peter's side-kick or intern and wondering what he would have called himself since there couldn't be two Spider-Men. He concludes by saying that if Peter was anything like thePeter he met, he would have loved to train under him.\nKitty Pryde imagines her life together with Peter, the two of them using their powers to fight crime together and eventually getting married and starting a life together. She chooses to keep this fantasy to herself however, telling the others that she doesn't think about what Peter might have become had he lived.\nBobby says that the superheroes Peter befriended in his life would go on to become the new Ultimates, and they will become really, really, really big superheroes, almost like celebrities.\nGwen finally decides that they should do a good deed in Peter's honour. Johnny wants a back rub, but everyone declines. Miles sees the food, and decides to give all the leftover food to a homeless shelter, which they do.\nEveryone says goodbye to each other later and leaves. But while this is going on, someone that looks a lot like Peter is hiding in the bushes watching them...\n• The world mourns on the anniversary of Peter Parker’s death\n• A gathering of Spidey’s friends and foes reveal some shocking truths about Peter and his world"

On a field trip of his school to the Alcorp Industries HQ, Sara Jane talks to him so she can get his help to uncover Alcorp's experiments on animals, even though her boyfriend, Gene, is picking him on.\nWhile the excursion goes off, Sara Jane and Patton sneak into the laboratory, setting off the alarm once they step in. While Sara rushes trying to save the animals, Patton becomes mesmerized with a spider, ignoring the warning label indicating that it's a irradiated female spider. As he picks up the spider, she bites him on the hand, just as he and Sara Jane are caught by security. After being reprimanded, they're both allowed to leave, with Sara Jane inviting Patton to join her since he reveals that his parents are dead and his Uncle works at night. Once at home, Patton starts to feel sick and then he's confronted by his uncle, who yells at him and beats him with his belt. Later on, Patton searches for food, finding a mouse behind the door, eating it as he discovers that the spider somehow imbued him with its powers.\nPatton starts hunting other animals as food, until his Uncle Ted comes home, discovering to his horror the house wrapped up with spider-webs. Patton states that it's dinner time before attacking his uncle. The next day, he resumes his normal life until he's confronted once again by Gene, who challenges him to a fight at lunchtime. Later, Patton meets a kid whose dog is missing, and tells the boy the dog is at his house, inviting him over.  That evening, Patton researches about the spider species that bit him, discovering that their females lay their eggs through their bite. Afterwards, Sara Jane visits him, asking him about Gene's whereabouts since he's not responding her calls. Patton tells her she deserves someone better than Gene and then kisses her, only to bite her neck immediately afterwards.\nSara slaps him, revealing his mutated eyes and Patton sheds his skin, transforming into a new spider-like form. Sara tries to run away entering into his room only to discover to her horror lots of cocoons hanging from the ceiling, including one with the kid from earlier and his Uncle Ted tied up in his bed. Patton professes his \"love\" to Sara Jane, while hundreds of baby spiders emerge from Uncle Ted's body as he screams in pain. As Patton approaches Sara Jane, Morlun suddenly arrives. When Sara Jane asks him who he is, Morlun simply introduces himself as a \"surprise dinner guest\", while acknowledging her presence with an indifferent glance. As Patton attacks Morlun, Sara Jane takes advantage of the situation to escape. Morlun muses that Patton is a very young totem, but he will suffice as an appetizer, dismembering him and absorbing his life force.\nThe next day, Sara Jane, thinks that the whole ordeal was just a dream until she checks the bit mark on her neck and sees hundreds of baby spiders emerging from it.\n• A radioactive spider bites a high school nerd who is already something of a monster."

The rest of the Spider-lings assist the civilians to clear the area until the work is done. During the battle, Spider-Man is called by MayorJ. Jonah Jamesonwho argues about why he's assaulting Shadowland, to which Otto replies that it was about time someone did it, and then \"asks\" Jonah to express his support or he will reveal their conversation from theRaft, while he also knows that Kingpin is tampering with his communications line, hoping he heard his intentions of taking him down for good.\nKingpin acknowledges that he's not thesame Spider-Manhe once fought, and then takes Hobgoblin with him to a secret room, where he introducesSmedley Kornfeld,  a man Kingpin hired as a döppelgänger to use as a decoy for events like this. Kingpin snaps his neck and takes his escape, leaving Hobgoblin to fend for himself. Hobgoblin escapes, but he's detected by aSpider-Bot, but to his surprise, the Spider-Bot engages theGoblin Protocoland ignores him.\nAfter the assault, Spider-Man is surrounded by the citizens who thank him for his work, and then he reveals to the media that his work was approved by Mayor Jameson, who is extremely angry by Spider-Man's manipulations. The citizens are relieved that Shadowland is gone and with it, the Kingpin's grasp on the people, but a new thug appears making deals in the alleys, carrying theGoblininsignia tattooed in his arm. One of the Spider-bots detects him and again, engages the Goblin Protocol and passes by.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nKainecomes out of the cocoon.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nThe next morning, Peter calls the doctor and he explains that Aunt May's health is worse and that she must go to the hospital. Aunt May is worried that Peter cannot look after himself, but he assures her he can. Later that day, Peter goes to class but ignores the taunts of Flash Thompson as his mind is focused on the well being of Aunt May. When Peter finally visits Aunt May, he finds Betty Brant there visiting. Peter has much on his mind and leaves abruptly, without seeing Betty home.\nMeanwhile, Electro decides to make a withdrawal at the Forest Hills Bank. There he uses electric shocks to keep the bank manager and his guest J. Jonah Jameson busy while he opens the timelock vault with his electrical powers. The next edition of the Daily Bugle is printed and there is an article claiming the criminal Electro is Spider-Man. Spider-Man searches for Electro and comes up empty a few times, and when he finally finds him, Electro defeats him. The next edition of the Bugle again claims to have proof that Spider-Man is Electro, which makes the public ask questions about who Spider-Man really is.\nAt a secret hideout after also reading the Bugle, Max Dillon tells his origin. When he's finished, he goes to the West Side House of Detention in downtown New York, where he sets about freeing some prisoners to become his flunkies. Jameson travels down there to see if Spider-Man shows up and to prove that they are one and the same. Peter is tied up looking after his aunt at the hospital but wants to go to the House of Detention to take photos for the Bugle. When Spider-Man finally turns up at the House of Detention, Jameson realizes his mistake: Electro and Spider-Man are different people.\nSpider-Man quickly puts rubber gloves on his hands and rubber boots on his feet to insulate him from the electric bolts he will face when he finds Electro. After a long fight with the inmates and Electro, Spider-Man finally defeats Electro with a fire hose and removes his mask, expecting to know who Electro is."

Anna Maria thinks he's joking but then sees that \"Peter\" is missing, not realizing he just jumped into action as Spider-Man. While he's seeking Lamaze, he's called by hisSpiderlingsabout Stunner's attack in thecity. Otto decides to confront her personally and once he arrives, he gets a full assault from her, and Stunner screams her motives: to avenge the death of her beloved Otto Octavius (since she doesn't know that Otto is now inhabitingSpider-Man's body). Meanwhile, at Potter's Field,Carlie Coopervisits the tomb of Otto Octavius, now knowing the full truth about the mindswitch, and reminisces about how Peter died as a hero but no one knew. Suddenly, the ground crumbles underneath her, revealing that the body is missing and she is then kidnapped by agreen-skinned assailant.\nStunner's assault against Spider-Man continues, with Otto trying to talk her out of attacking but she refuses to listen, bent on making her revenge complete, forcing Otto to wrap her in his new enhanced spider-web, buying some time to send his Spiderbots to track the source of Stunner's VR Interface and shut it down, although once Otto leaves, she easily escapes. Otto returns to E.S.U. to find Lamaze, who is talking with Anna Maria. Otto adjusts his earpiece to listen in on their conversation, hearing Anna Maria determined to convince Lamaze that \"Peter\" is not doing anything wrong and is one of the smartest men she ever knew, making Otto discover how much she understands him. Suddenly his Spider-Sense alerts him of a bus flying by after it was launched by Stunner, heading straight into Lamaze and Anna Maria, but Otto catches it with a thick layer of his Spider-Web in time to save them, which unfortunately leaves him open to Stunner's assault, who goes as far as tearing his mechanical legs apart. Stunner attacks Spider-Man, wanting him to beg for mercy and avenge Otto's death, but in the nick of time, theSpiderbotsmanage to shut down Angelina's interface.\nAfter the attack, Otto arrives to the secret lab, finding Angelina unconscious, managing to take away her Virtual Reality System. Once she wakes up, she is shocked to see Otto Octavius in person, just the way she knew him, not realizing that Otto is using the same method of Stunner by making his own \"Doctor Octopus\" avatar, however, Otto tells Angelina that he moved on while she was in a coma, but he'll always care for her. Afterwards, Otto visits Lamaze, who the next day drops all his accusations against \"Peter\". After they leave, Lamaze reveals to \"Peter\" that Otto Octavius visited him and revealed that it was \"Peter\" who gave Otto all the ideas for his inventions. \"Peter\" asks him to keep it a secret to avoid hurting Otto's ego, and Lamaze and Anna Maria congratulate him for his earned doctorate.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nThe Hulk is coming back from destroying a colony of intelligent super-tarantulas. As he approaches his S.H.I.E.L.D. pick up point, they prepare to deal with the gamma-spawned brute. When he arrives, they open a series of large metal containers which contain a whole bunch of playful puppies. This delights the Hulk who calms down enough to trigger a reversion back into Bruce Banner. Bruce learns that he is being deployed again, but this time they don't need the strength of the Hulk, but the mind of Bruce Banner. Soon a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter brings Banner to Empire State University where he meets with Spider-Man, time-displaced original X-Men, and Dr. Jude. After the pleasantries are exchanged, Banner does a double take when he realizes how young these X-Men are, prompting the Beast to explain the situation. They also explain the appearance of a younger, healthier, Doctor Octopus whom they have a prisoner. The X-Men believe that he must have followed them forward in time, although Spider-Man can't bring himself to believe it.\nWhen Banner suggests that they use the resources that S.H.I.E.L.D. has provided him, neither the X-Men or Spider-Man want to get involved with the anti-espionage agency. Banner agrees and they start working at Empire State University instead. Soon, Bruce, Dr. Jude, the Beast and Spider-Man get to work to try and understand who this Doctor Octopus was and why he is immitting gamma radiation. As they work on solving this mystery, Bruce Banner cannot help but be impressed at the scientific knowledge that Spider-Man has at his disposal. He also wonders how a great scientist like Dr. Jude could be reduced to such an undignified position at ESU after being such an accomplished scientist. They theorize the possibility that this is actually some kind of construct of Octavius, but they cannot figure out who could have made it or why. While Spider-Man carries out more tests, the Beast observes the proceedings with Dr. Jude's student Molly. Henry becomes bashful when she starts asking him if he is currently dating somebody when suddenly there is a large crash from outside.\nBruce, Spider-Man, and Hank rush outside and witness the rest of the X-Men battling what appears to be the Abomination. Banner suspects this may be another time displacement as the Abomination is dead. However, he realizes that the X-Men are no match for this foe and tells Spider-Man to get them to cover. Banner then approaches the Abomination and before his long-time foe can attack him, Banner transforms into the Hulk. With the battle between the two raging on, Spider-Man tells the X-Men that they need to get to their time machine and investigate what is going on. However, the blows between the two powerhouses cause a hole to open up in the ground. When Molly falls in, the Beast goes to save her, Dr. Jude says there is no time. However, Henry is not willing to leave the girl in danger and leaps down to recover her. As the Hulk and the Abomination battle it out in the nearby football field, Spider-Man commandeers the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter that brought Banner to them. When Iceman sees that he is bringing Doctor Octopus, he protests this move. However, Spider-Man is more interested in sending the apparent time displaced villain back to where he came from.\nMeanwhile, the Beast finds Molly, who is miraculously unhurt. However, she has discovered a secret lab beneath the school. At that moment on the surface, the Hulk strikes the Abomination with such force he decapitates his opponent, revealing it to be nothing more than a robot. Meanwhile, Beast and Molly discover a number of pieces of equipment that she had wrote grant requests for and was told that she was denied. They also find schematics to create a Doctor Octopus robot. Realizing what's going on, the Beast asks to use Molly's cell phone to tell the others. When Spider-Man receives the call he turns to confront Doctor Jude. Realizing his ruse has been exposed, the doctors eyes begin to glow and suddenly the helicopter explodes.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:"

Spider-Man begins to fight him but realizes he can’t fight Rhino head-on as he keeps charging and could easily destroy him. Spider-Man trips and flips Rhino onto his head knocking him unconscious for the police to arrest him.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nHe then starts beating them until Speed Demon unleashes a super-speed attack full of fists. Octavius is annoyed and swings away. Boomerang throws a boomerang at him but he dodges. It curves back and is about to hit an officer. \"Spider-Man\" jumps back in to shield the officer with his own body and Octavius doesn't know why he did such a thing. Boomerang comes up and is about to cut off Spidey's head when he turns around and scratches him with his newly implemented claws.\nFor some reason, at this revelation, Boomerang decides to leave along with the rest of the Sinister Six and the officers help \"Spider-Man\" up. The officer is grateful for the save and asks what he can do for him. He tells him to ship the Living Brain toHorizon Labswhere an \"associate\" (i.e. him) can study it.\nBack at Horizon Labs, \"Peter\" looks over his recent shipping of the Living Brain whileGradylooks on in envy. \"Peter\" leaves andMaxappears right behind him and asks Grady if he's seen Peter. Max goes to Peter's lab and asks him about \"helping\" Spider-Man. He says that he's developing weapons and that he can't condone that. \"Peter\" dissuades his fears by showing him the few of many revolutionary new technologies he's exploring that could be used for peace. Max is convinced and in awe of \"Peter\"'s work. He congratulates \"Peter\" and credits all this to the name Peter Parker.\nBack in the Octavius mindset, Ock is angry. All of his work is going to be credited to Peter Parker and not him. He brushes off these fears by repeating to himself that HE is Peter Parker now. Just then,Mary Janecalls \"Peter\" for their date.\nThey go to a restaurant and they talk. Mary Jane asks why Peter is wearing a headset at the date. He reveals to her that when he scratched Boomerang, he injected many nano-Spider-Tracers into him and that now he can hear and follow where they are. Mary Jane is flummoxed. She asks him why he isn't going after them when he knows where they are. Peter brushes it off as \"I know what I'm doing\" and pours himself a glass of wine. Mary Jane is skeptical.\nAt dawn the next day, the new Sinister Six break into Horizon Labs and steal equipment. They run outside to see the whole building webbed around. They are surprised to see Spider-Man already there. Speed Demon rushes him but Spider-Man pushes the spider on his chest and Demon slips. \"Spider-Man\" flashes back to when he swept the floor outside to coat it with a material to make it instantaneously friction-less. \"Spidey\" webs a line so that Speed Demon slips into it with his neck as he's slipping to stop him.\nThe villains are shocked at the brutality as Spidey clicks his spider again. The lights around them turn red. The lights are a power dampening field. The new Beetle collapses as the armor she's wearing is nonfunctional. Shocker's gauntlets are nullified and Overdrives hijackedWheelis useless. \"Spider-Man\" webs the Wheel vehicle and makes it tumble on Shocker. Norah Winters congratulates \"Spidey\" and Boomerang wonders why the press are here. As it turns out, \"Peter\" called them a while ago so that everybody could witness the defeat of the new Sinister Six.\n\"Spider-Man\" lunges at Boomerang just as he's admitting defeat and starts pummeling him. He wants to prove that this is what happens when anybody crosses Spider-Man. He's about to finish him off when something holds him back. The officers arrive and are about to cart the team of super-villains away when suddenly something shocking is revealed. Octavius can't seem to know why he held back when he was dead-set on killing him.Peter'sconsciousness appears and tells him that it was him.\nHowever, Octavius cannot notice him but Peter is still in his body. Peter swears not to let Octavius kill or do bad. He doesn't know how he's still in his body and alive but he swears on everything that he'll be in control again."

Fortunately for Peter,Silkarrives in the nick of time, covering his face with webbing. Black Cat andElectrobattle her but she manages to escape the place, impressing Peter with her good performance in her first supervillain battle, prompting Felicia to search for reinforcements.\nFelicia arrives to theBar with No Name, where the criminals present are giving an eulogy for Francine (who was accidentally killed by Electro). She requests their assistance against Spider-Man but all of them refuse since she's still allied with Electro and consider her a danger. Meanwhile, Silk brings Peter back home whereAnna Mariahelps him to take off the webbing off his face. Anna reminds Peter of another commitment from his company to demonstrate their Anti-Electro trap, bringing Silk again, since Peter considers her \"His Good Luck charm\".\nElectro pressuresSajaniinto telling him how effective the Anti-Electro trap will be in removing his powers but Felicia interrupts their talk in order to ask her about how the device works. They both infiltrate the demonstration, suiting Electro into the \"Fake Electro\" costume while Felicia disguises herself as one of the operators. Anna Maria brings Peter and Cindy into the demonstration, only to be warned by the lattermost's Spider-Sense of the danger ahead (revealing that her Spider-Sense is more acute and accurate than Peter's). They both suit up, but Anna complains that Peter is once again bailing out on his company, but Peter leaves Anna in charge, albeit after giving her a promotion with a better title and more pay. Silk wraps up Peter with extra webbing in order to give him better protection against Electro once they jump into action.\nAs Anna Maria arrives to announce the cancellation of the demonstration, Black Cat and Electro see that the News helicopter approaches, apparently being anonymously tipped off by her, since she wanted all eyes on them (but mostly on her). Felicia starts the machine, further enhancing Electro's power only to be interrupted by Spider-Man and Silk. Electro blasts him off but his insulated webbing protects him. Right then, he tells Silk to cover Electro with her webbing while he deals with Felicia. She changes the plan, using the wiring to overload Electro, putting his powers way out of control, shooting his lightning bolts against the helicopter, but Silk manages to make a giant airbag with her webbing to save them.\nPeter tries to stop Felicia who puts him to the test asking him if he will waste time confronting her or saving his enemy, this in order to see if it's really him instead ofOctavius. Peter jumps into the machine, using his webbing to cover Electro in order to take him out of there. Peter asks Felicia for help but she refuses, revealing that she wants to see him burn, since their relationship and the trust she had into him made her weak, calling him the unluckiest part of her life. Electro asks to let go, but Peter remains determined to save him, until they both are saved by Silk who pulls them out of the machine. Peter asks Silk to wrap the three of them into a webpod to save them from the explosion.\nThe Fact Channel reports the explosion, announcing that Electro is now depowered, while the police blames the incident on the poor security measures fromParker Industries, but Jonah once again launches another of his tirades against Spider-Man, giving his co-anchor Natalie the time to talk with Cindy who decided to take a job with them as their new intern (after hearing thanks to her heightened senses that her former intern quit during the explosion), determined to use their assets in order to find her missing family.\nAfter the incident, most of the low-level criminals visit Black Cat, who took over theEel'sformer hideout, in order to proclaim their new allegiance to her, impressed with how she fought Spidey, took out Electro, and gave the police force and Parker Industries a major blow. Felicia enjoys her newfound glory, leaving her determined to become the Queen of the criminal underground.\nIn Parker Industries, Sajani manages to return safely, while Anna and Peter discuss the fact that thecityhates the company, Black Cat is still on the loose and now he must face the danger of Morlun, but Peter considers the day a win since they managed to save Electro's life and also depower him. Sajani enters the room and tells them that in order to escape she had to reveal how the machine works, although unbeknownst to them she was willing to give them information, since she considers the \"Super-Villain Prison\" the worst business model, aside from the apparent strong dislike to Peter. Sajani asks Anna Maria for her help in Peter's other projects but tells her to keep this from Peter, who reflects that this was a good day for them, albeit with a few bumps, but things are looking bright for him ahead.\n• The finale of the record-breaking first arc of AMAZING SPIDER-MAN where all hell breaks loose on Peter Parker.\n• Parker Industries has promised a humane and secure super-villain containment system but Black Cat and Electro have other ideas…"

Max takes Otto out of his lapse, realizing that he spent eight minutes trying to figure out the answer, while the rest of the team and Tiberius pulled together a device to counteract the effects. Spider-Man still tries to figure out the equation, while the rest of the crew evacuates, all but Tiberius who is caught by Spidey 2099 and forced into staying with him until the explosion, with Spidey 2099 planning to rewrite the future withoutAlchemaxor the Stones (implying that he will also die in the process).Tyler Stonecalls to demand Spidey 2099 stop, while the effects of the timeline are altering everything.\nOtto finally discovers the answer of the equation, but starts to have self-doubts, since it's now too late to prevent the explosion. To make matters \"worse\", it is shown to the reader (not anyone else, due to it being in Otto's brain) that Peter, due to Otto attempting to access Peter's memories, is able to break back out of the rubble that apparently killed him months earlier. Meanwhile,Mayor J. Jonah Jamesonarrived to aid in the evacuation while confronting Modell and the Horizon Labs crew and Spidey 2099 and Tiberius escape in the nick of time before Horizon Labs explodes, but it ends up becoming a controlled implosion thanks to the equation. The time event ends and both Tyler Stone and Spidey 2099 are safe, but Tyler decides to destroy the time machine, leaving Spidey 2099 stranded in the past and knowing he won't hurt Tiberius without risking all of his life there while Tiberius is free since all of the evidence is now destroyed in Horizon.\nAfterwards, Tiberius andLiz Allencelebrate the birth of a new mega-corp, after merging her company, Allan Chemical, with her son's stocks atOscorpand Tiberius' remaining properties from Horizon intoAlchemax, but they are interrupted by a young man called Michael O'Mara, who is now hired as Tiberius' assistant. Unbeknownst to them, Michael is actually Miguel O'Hara, planning to stay close to Tiberius until he gets the chance to bring down Alchemax.\nBack in New York, Mayor Jameson tells Modell that if he agrees to no longer rebuild Horizon Labs in the city, he'll pull his contacts inWashingtonto shake the federals off his shoulders, doing it in the memory of his late wife who considered Modell a close friend. After Jameson leaves, Modell and Grady manage to find a life sign in the middle of the remaining chronotron energy, bringing Spider-Man back to the present, however, once he's back, Modell tells him that for the sake of everyone, they both should stay away from each other, and that goes for Peter as well. Once Otto returns home, he receives a string of voice messages fromAunt May,Anna Maria, and mostly, fromMary Jane. Otto angrily calls MJ, who replies that she's fed up with \"Peter's\" attitude and it's time for her to move on, bidding farewell to him.\nThe Horizon team prepares to depart from New York City to continue their work, since theZephyrboat is actually the personal property of Modell's.Uatuand Sajani stay behind (Uatu due to his family's request and Sajani because she lost Modell's trust after the reveal that she kept the dangerous Reverbium), but once they depart, Sajani receives a phone call from \"Peter\" who proposes a job opportunity for her.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nAs the Carnage symbiote takes over the Wizard, Klaw realizes that he can experience events that occurred across time and space, witnessing the birth of the Carnage symbiote and its first bonding with Cletus Kasady, experiencing the symbiote's solace and relief in finding a suitable host. As he views the times it was abandoned by Cletus and bonded to Ben Reilly, Norrin Radd, and Tanis Nieves, Klaw realizes that the symbiote has only grown stronger over time and with successive hosts, and that separating it from Cletus Kasady was the worst thing he and the Wizard could have done. Psychoanalyzing it, Klaw compares the Carnage to a human teenager, striving for independence while also craving a connection to its original host - its family. As Klaw nears the present, he witnesses the badly-injured Wizard telling reporters he just wants to see his son, and Bentley-23 seeing his father in a new light, realizing that the Carnage symbiote and the Wizard are angry about the same thing.\nLifting a car over his head, Carnage furiously demands to know where his family is. Malus regains consciousness and asks to know what is going on, but Spider-Man tells him to stay down and shields him from the car, radioing for backup and instructing his troops to bring the prototype flamethrowers. Spider-Man laments that the one bit of Peter Parker he couldn't purge was bad luck as Carnage lunges, forming an arm-blade and snarling that Spider-Man promised him his son. Spider-Man dodges and states that the deal was that he'd give him his son if he helped control Carnage, and the Wizard retorts that he did one better by becoming Carnage. Spider-Man tells the Wizard to turn himself in, reminding him that the symbiote killed his friend Klaw and asking how it feels to be in the skin of someone he despises. Carnage mockingly turns the question on Spider-Man, taunting him with his knowledge of Otto's secret. As a platoon of Spiderlings arrive, Spider-Man orders them to immolate Carnage but the prototype flamethrowers fail. Smashing Carnage with a parking meter, Spider-Man orders Malus to run, but Malus reminds him he's a paraplegic and can't even walk. Carnage pounces on Malus and devours him, spattering the Spiderlings with blood, while Klaw laments the Wizard's loss of control to the symbiote.\nA Spiderling runs up to Spider-Man saying a boy claiming to be the Wizard's son has arrived, but Otto furiously punches him hard enough to knock him out, snapping to never reveal intel that could be used against him. Carnage quips that he doesn't think the Spiderling heard him and mockingly asking if there is adoctorhiding amongst them. As Spider-Man furiously attacks, Carnage snares him with tendrils and demands that Otto make good on his promise, mauling him while threatening to destroy his life and undo the miracle that Otto pulled off. Spider-Man relents, telling his Spiderlings to bring Carnage's family in, but as the Wizard jubilantly proclaims his victory Spider-Man says he wasn't talking to him, but to the symbiote. A status pod containing Cletus Kasady's badly burnt but still-living body is wheeled out by two Spiderlings, surprising Klaw, who had assumed Kasady perished when the base was destroyed. The Carnage symbiote immediately leaves the Wizard, taking care to make the separation as agonizing as possible, and too late Spider-Man orders the Spiderlings to contain it before it reaches Kasady. As the symbiote reunites with Cletus, Klaw realizes he was wrong about his earlier assessment of the alien: it hasn't been continually abandoning, but has deliberately been separating itself from Cletus to become more powerful and mold him into the perfect host, its soul mate.\nAs the symbiote suffocates the Spiderlings, Spider-Man takes one of the sonic guns and aims it at Carnage. In control of Cletus, the Carnage symbiote speaks, snarling at Spider-Man to stay back and claiming Cletus's body as its property. Disarming Spider-Man and knocking him aside, Carnage prepares to devour the Wizard in retaliation for separating the symbiote from its beloved host. Using the last of his energy, Klaw manifests in the storm clouds above the battle and hits Carnage with a bolt of lightning, the intense heat and the point-blank shockwave of the thunder separating Cletus from the symbiote again. Spider-Man has the symbiote contained before it can recover, while Klaw is satisfied with being able to avenge his own death and save the Wizard, allowing his consciousness to fade into oblivion.\nThe Wizard is hospitalized, while the Carnage symbiote is taken to Spider-Man's base to be contained and studied. Some time later, at a maximum security prison hospital wing, a doctor tells a Spiderling that the Carnage symbiote cured the Wizard's dementia, while in his cell the Wizard and his son converse via instant messaging. The Spiderling asks the doctor if the Wizard remembers anything about Spider-Man's secret identity, but the doctor says they can't know for sure. As the Spiderling leaves, he stops and asks if the doctor is sure that the symbiote repaired the Wizard's brain. The doctor verifies this, asking why the Spiderling wanted to know."

However, Monster refuses to answer until she first knows who is behind the Goblin mask. Goblin replies that he's the original Goblin, Norman Osborn himself, but Monster remains skeptical about it and asks him to take off his mask, which he refuses to do unless she has proven herself to be part of the Goblin family, sending her to attack Kingsley's minions.\nThe Avengers are having a hard time battling against both  Venom/Otto and the Spiderlings, makingCapmake the call for reinforcements.Iron Manresponds but Cap sends him to pick upFlash Thompson, who is the actual host of the Venomsymbiote.

Goblin Knight reports to the King and makes one final hit to one of Kingsley's men killing him, while taunting Kingsley.\nThe Avengers are starting to fall against the power of the Venom-possessed Otto who boasts about his superiority, until Tony Stark arrives to distract him, allowing Flash, who was wearingTony's armor,attack from behind and attempt to retake the symbiote. The symbiote seizes control of Otto's body and lashes out at Flash, berating him for suppressing it and proclaiming itself superior. Otto realize the symbiote was undermining his control and that bonding to it was a mistake, and tries to cast it out. Finds out he can´t, he gives into despair andPeter Parker'sconsciousness, who managed to survive the mind purge, is forced to intervene. The symbiote finally leaves Spider-Man's body and returns to Flash. Peter sees that Otto doesn't know about his return and it's better to keep it that way until he manages to find a way to take action.\nOtto sees an opportunity to get away from suspicion once again, using the argument that he had some remnants of the Venom symbiote had infected him when they last fought and had been slowly taking over him, thus explaining his erratic behavior. The Avengers look skeptical about it, but let it be for the time being. At theNYPDPrecinct, AuntMayandJonah Sr.argue withDetective Watanabe, demanding to releaseMary Jane. She replies that she's free to go but both her and Peter Parker will be under observation to answer for the disappearance of Carlie. MJ buys some time to avoid answering to a worried May about Peter but she leaves the precinct to return to her apartment, finding \"Peter\" there. Peter also uses the symbiote argument to explain his behavior and apologizes, to which MJ believes, replying that she still sees the old Peter inside.

When Otto opens the door to his weapons cache, he curses as the room had been looted of everything. A pumpkin bomb sails through the air and Punisher shoots it, causing it to explode.\nDaredevil detects footsteps, and once the smoke clears, he says that the culprit is disguised as one of Otto'sSpider Patrol.

When the trio attempt to talk to the imposter, Daredevil realizes he is communicating with someone else, namely, theGoblin King.\nIn the Goblin Underground, theGoblin Knightquestions as to why the Goblin King did not send any further orders, to which he replied that Daredevil would have detected his voice and found out his true identity, and that it was not the time to reveal himself yet. The Goblin King then reveals that the imposter was not the only one present on Spider-Island.\nBack at Spider-Island, Otto tries to convince the imposter not to set off the bombs, saying he can protect him, but the imposter responds that Otto has no idea what he had done, and that he had practically helped the Goblin King to strengthen his empire, but is cut off by Punisher shooting his thumb off before he can finish.

Once inside, Peter reveals that Otto made a big mistake coming here, as Peter's friends and family begin to appear out of nowhere, restraining Otto.\nBut Otto is prepared, having been in Peter's head for months, and has everything to mount a defense, as he summons all of Peter's greatest enemies, including the likes ofKingpin,Sandman,Mysterioand theGreen Goblin- his fears and anxieties taken form and brought to life.\nOtto gives the order to destroy Peter's friends but to spare Peter himself. Peter tries to stop him, saying that Otto had promised that he would protect them, but the massacre continues, causing Peter to lose his memories of them.\nWith tears streaming from his eyes, he calls Otto a monster, pleading for him to stop, to which Otto  taunted the fragment by saying how everything would soon end and Peter Parker would be no more.\nPeter responds with a new resolve - he strips off his outer skin, remembering that he is also the AMAZING SPIDER-MAN! He launches an assault on Otto, before questioning him what would have been the right thing to do, the one thing that is responsible of him as a hero.\nOtto replies, with a wicked grin, that he has to give the world what it truly needs - a SUPERIOR SPIDER-MAN, tearing off his original facade to reveal his own Spider Man costume underneath, to Peter's chagrin.\nThey continue to fight each other, both questioning about who deserves to be Spider Man based on their actions. While Peter blames Otto for his brutality on criminals, causing theAvengersto doubt him and no one trusting him as a result, Otto retorts Peter for attempting to be a \"friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\", trying hard to make everyone love him, and cites theVultureusing children as his minions as a consequence - all because Peter took it easy on him. And that because Peter letMassacrelive, he killed over thirty innocent people.\nLastly, Otto reprimands Peter that due to his interference, he almost failed to operate onAmyand save her life. The memory fragment initially says that it was due to his distrust of Otto, but he realizes the true reason behind his actions - because Otto was about to get the scanner and find him, and loses the will to fight.\nOtto then determines that Peter isn't worthy of being Spider-Man and that he is nothing. He then puts the final nail in Peter's coffin by resuming his mind wipe, leaving the fragment rooted to the spot.\nAs what remains of Peter's memories get stripped away, the memory fragment Peter struggles to hold on to his own identity, but even that is lost, as darkness envelops him.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nAgent Venom, AKA Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson, rips open a door and orders his men to search the area.

After dissuading their fears, they examine some security footage.\nMeanwhile, at a police checkpoint two hours later, the policemen are blocking and examining the cars for Kasady. The see Kasady and try to capture him. But suddenly the policemen's throats and faces are slit and some cars explode. Kasady appears to have done nothing.

Flash (Venom) asks for files and articles on \"really tiny killers\" and he gets an article titled \"Not Everything is Bigger inTexas\".\nFlash toHoustontwo days later.Kaine, Scarlet Spider, is swinging to a crime scene ten minutes late because he had forgot that he was now a super- \"hero\". He finds a cut up women in the blazing inferno and a mentally shattered man. The man screams in terror at the sight of Scarlet Spider thinking he is the assailant. He then rescues said man and puts him in a hospital. This person is identified asRyan Ketola.\nAs it turns out, the assailant's target was his wife,Dr. Ketolaworking at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center and is currently being interviewed by aMs. Kieran. They are discussing the rumors floating around that this space center is exploiting the research of the sub-atomic universe and its resources. The doctor tells the reporter off and they both get up to leave.\nHOWEVER, Kasady is at the scene and changes into hisCarnage symbiotegarbs and leaps towards the doctor whilst asking her about the completion of a purported \"Prometheus Pit\". He also taunts her by saying \"YOUR HUSBAND SAYS HI\" revealing him as the assailant.\nBy just in the nick of time, Kaine crashes through a window and socks Carnage right in the face. Carnage thinks that Kaine isSpider-Manbut Kaine quickly tries to rectify this by snapping Carnage's neck. However, Carnage simply snaps it back into place and stabs a symbiote tendril through Kaine. Kaine uses his \"Other\" powers (i.e. Organic webbing and pincers that come out from his wrists) to break free.\nCarnage realizes this isn't HIS Spider-Man. Kaine is suddenly zapped from behind and falls. He sees the impossible: a tiny group of people. They tell Carnage to help them reach the Pit and to stop wasting time on Kaine.\nHowever, Carnage still advances towards Kaine. Ms. Kieran, the reporter, fires three shots into Carnage. Carnage entangles her with his tendrils and intimidates her. He also captures the good doctor while doing this. They (Carnage and his flunkies) break into the room housing the Pit and open it. The doctor seems to be under some mind control when she is solving the last algorithm for the Pit to work. Carnage and his pals and the captives all go into the pit.\nBefore descending however, one of these miniature creatures tell Kasady to remember the deal. He responds,\"I know. I kill for you, you give me a whole new life. A new start. A wholenew universeto kill people in.\" Kaine recovers at this point and webs Carnage's hand. Carnage retaliates by shooting symbiote projectiles through the doctor and then jumping into the pit. At these turn of events, Kaine then swears to kill Carnage."

Captain Stacy confronts her, but after stalling for a while, Gwen decides to reveal her identity as Spider-Woman to him, arguing that he is a good cop, because he has a job to do as an officer, while she used to be Spider-Woman to avoid responsibilities, but after Peter's death, has decided to assume the responsibility for her powers, and avoid the same thing happening again, mostly because of monsters like Aleksei and because, responding to his earlier words, this is where she's needed the most now. Captain Stacy relents and tells her to go, buying her time before he regains his senses, and as she escapes, she's being watched bya mysterious Spider-Man clad in the Union Jack flag, saying that \"She'll do quite nicely\".\n• GWEN STACY: SPIDER-WOMAN!\n• In one universe, it wasn’t Peter Parker bitten by the radioactive Spider, but Gwen Stacy!\n• She’s smart, charming and can lift a car-- Just don’t tell her Police Chief father!"

He appeals to her fandom forCarolin order to snap her out of the shock by using the \"Slingshot\" maneuver he created with Carol. Kamala wants to keep fighting, suggesting they try a \"Fastball Special\" next, but Spidey tells her that they must focus on retrieving the cocoon. As they approach,oneof the thugs complains that he accepted the job because Minerva wasn't an enemy of Spider-Man (since he refuses to take any jobs that involves Spider-Man), but takes advantage of the situation so he can modify his Sonic Scanner into a weapon. Spidey and Kamala try to escape with the cocoon, but Kamala's size makes her an easy target, and as she fights against Minerva the cocoon starts to hatch.\nMeanwhile, asCindy Moonponders on her rent status, she is called to assistNatalie Longat theFact Channel. Natalie reviews the battle between Silk andElectroand considers making her their \"exclusive\" just like theBugledid with Spider-Man, but criticizes Silk's outfit as tacky. Just as Natalie gets a report on two crimes, one being Spidey's battle, Cindy escapes to deal with the other situation, determined to become the Fact Channel's exclusive by making herself a new outfit.\nThe cocoon hatches revealing a seemingly human baby inside, which Kamala takes to keep him safe while Spidey battles Minerva. The henchmen take down Kamala while she keeps the baby safe, but as she confronts them one of the henchmen turns against the rest, showing moral qualms about attacking someone carrying a baby. The henchman takes off his mask so that he won't scare the baby and then joins Spider-Man, who explains that Kamala knows everything about the Kree thanks to her knowledge of Carol Danvers, while the henchman is a local. This prompts Spidey to ask Minerva if she is indeed working for the Kree Empire, since it's rare that she's using local people instead of Kree Soldiers, and Minerva insists that her activities are fully sanctioned by the Kree Empire. Spidey fakes a call to Jarvis in Avengers Tower to ask the Kree if they know about Minerva's activities in order to call her bluff, which succeeds, forcing her her escape the site.\nAt the other robbery site, The Ringer attempts to escape, only to be taken down quickly by Silk, making her first appearance in her new outfit in front of Natalie Long and the cameras of the Fact Channel, saying that it was time for a change.\nSpidey and Kamala bring the baby to the hospital so he can be taken care of with his parents. Kamala worries since they don't know what powers she might have, but Spider-Man insists that they love her and that will be a good start. He says he has to leave to make an alert atAvengers Towerabout Minerva and compliments Kamala, seeing a reflection of his past self when he was a teenage superhero dealing with the double life. He encourages her, saying that she'll do fine, then confronts the henchman, who swears that he was trying to find legit work but nobody wants to hire a man with a criminal record since juvie, only to be stunned when Spidey recognizes him as Clayton Cole, his first rival, formerly known as Clash, which surprised Clayton. Spidey sees that Clayton really wants to go straight and change his life, but no one wants to hire a man with \"Supervillain since fifteen\" on their resume, so he gives him a card fromParker Industries, claiming that Parker believes in second chances and to tell him he sent him. He takes it and by the next day he is officially hired into Peter's company.

Eel treats her as a joke, taunting her with the fallout from her capture by Spider-Man (thenOtto Octavius) and that he is now a Maggia mob boss and then attacks her while asking her what she got, but Felicia tells him that as a thief, she takes what she wants and retaliates revealing her companion, none other thanElectrowho attacks the Eel and his goons while Felicia taunts him that she'll take everything from him.\nMeanwhile,PeterandCindyare giving in to their primal urges of desire until Cindy tries to take off his mask. Peter says that the mask stays on but is surprised to hear that she knows his secret identity, giving him the \"Cold Shower\" he needed to stop. They both reflect on what's happening, with Peter thinking that maybe it was a mistake to set Cindy free, but she replies that the damage is done already and she doesn't want to return, eager to see theworldshe missed for ten years, even telling him that he was the first person she kissed in all those years.\nOn another part of thecity,J. Jonah Jamesonis preparing for his first appearance in theFact Channelas an official anchor, only to be told that he's being bumped from the first segment, which is an interview to promote the upstarting companyParker Industries, sincehis fatheris the company's main investor and the CEO is his step-brother Peter, much to Jonah's chagrin, however, one of the crewmembers tells his boss that Parker Industries' representativeSajanihasn't arrived yet, since unbeknownst to them, she's kidnapped by Black Cat and Electro.\nAt the Black Cat's lair, Sajani tells Electro her surprise to be eating caviar and drinking champagne since that's not what supervillains usually do, but Electro replies that this is just from Black Cat while he just doesn't care about that but the traps that Peter's company is building. Sajani actually agrees with Electro, putting the blame on Peter proclaiming her belief that the company is wasting time and resources into building tech to capture and cure Electro, picking his interest as she mentions the word \"Cure\".\nMeanwhile, in an abandoned warehouse,Mister NegativeandPhil Urich, now leading the remnants of theGoblin Undergroundas the self-proclaimed new Goblin King, are waiting for the Eel to arrive in order to divide the criminal underground afterOsborn'sdownfall, but they are stunned by seeing the Eel crashing into the place from a window. Then, Black Cat arrives demanding Eel's share of the plan, but Mister Negative refuses, saying that she only got reputation and that it was taken by the Spider, she reminds him of how he was exposed as Martin Li and says that she they have one thing in common: they were all publicly outed by Spider-Man, but she'll succeed where they failed in the goal of defeating him.\nAnna Mariaarrives back into the apartment, only to find out that Peter is now making out with Silk on the ceiling. After Silk confronts her and then calms down, Anna Maria reveals that since Sajani is missing, Peter must go to the Fact Channel to make the announcement from Parker Industries. Peter tries to avoid it, but finally gives in.\nPeter, accompanied by Cindy, arrives to the Channel and have a little chat with Jonah, who announces that after his interview, he will go after Spider-Man like he never did before, Peter simply tells him to never change. Once the interview starts, Jay Sr. and Aunt May watch him on TV while he talks about the company's plans to create the most advanced supervillain prison, but then he's warned by Cindy about the impending danger, which Peter's Spider-Sense catches a bit later, due to the fact that Cindy's Spider-Sense is more advanced. As the interview goes on, Electro attacked the security team on the channel and Black Cat arrives announcing her demand that if Spider-Man doesn't show up in 15 minutes, Peter Parker will be dead.\nElectro complains about the plan but Felicia stays determined that Spider-Man will show up, but then Silk arrives to confront the both, giving Peter the time to change into Spider-Man and jump into action, naming Silk as \"Spinning Jenny, his side-kick\". As Silk battles against Electro and Peter deals with Black Cat, Jonah remains on the channel, forcing the cameraman to film the action. Peter tries to convince Felicia to stop, even while she doesn't believe his story of being mind-swapped. Electro fails to stop Silk but Felicia manage to use her bad luck powers to deviate one of Electro's bolts hitting Spider-Man, knocking him down in the process.\nWhile Felicia taunts Peter into her final vengeance, grabbing his head in order to pull off his mask, prompting Jonah to aim the camera into Spidey and announce that now has come the time to reveal the face behind the mask of Spider-Man.\nORIGINAL SIN tie-in!\n• The greatest untold secret of Spider-Man’s world has a name – SILK!"

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nLocations:\nVehicles:\n(see original at[1])\nAll-New X-Factor #04. Written by Peter David; art by Carmine di Giandomenico; colors by Rachelle Rosenberg. (Sponsored by Serval Industries.)\nPeter David pulls the same gag again on the second page, where he recaps last issue and then does a real-world plug. Still kinda neat. Danger isn’t filled in yet on the All-New X-Factor roster, I guess that’ll probably happen in issue # 5.\nWe pick up where we left off last issue, with Danger blowing a fuse and trying to kill everyone, thanks to Nil‘s hacks. Gambit tries talking Danger down and eats a Go Go Gadget Fist! for his troubles.\nNote Gambit’s lamenting “after everything… we’ve been through t’gether…”. That’s called foreshadowing, folks!\nDanger drops Gambit off with Quicksilver and Polaris, then wonders where Nil ran off to.\nJean-Luc stops Nil from escaping, just in time for Danger to level the building on them with a big ol’ KRA-KOOOOM. Danger finds Jean-Luc in the rubble and asks where Nil ran off to, before she’s BLAKOWed by a kinetically charged card. Gambit does some kinda weird Darth Maul Light Saber thing with his staff, and the fight is on!\nOr not, as Quicksilver SHOOOMs Gambit away. Gambit says “we have to get her to remember who she is…” (foreshadowing!)\nCut to Nil, trying to “reestablish the control sphere”. Danger finds him. She then splits herself into four Dangers, with Nil in the middle. They all blast at the same time.\nThankfully, Quicksilver SHOOOMs through again and grabs Nil. Danger deploys her hard light holograms of giant Sentinels and a bridge. We almost get a Wile E. Coyote moment when the bridge disappears beneath Quicksilver and Nil. Luckily, Polaris shows up to save them. Danger replies “Happily!” to Polaris’s challenge, and she thinks that’s weird for Danger to be showing emotions (FORESHADOWING!!).\nPolaris realizes Danger is made up of metal and she blasts her into a million pieces. Gambit tries to stop her, for some reason. (hmmmm)\nGambit: “That was Danger! … She’s more that a robot!”\nPolaris: “Look, I don’t know what sort of relationship you may have had with her … and by the way, she wasn’t really alive.”\nGambit: “She’s more alive than some people I know”.\nNow, I’m relatively new to comics and missed pretty much everything between the mid ’90s and last year, but do you think maybe something is going on between Gambit and the robot Danger?\nAll-New-X-factor-004-(2014)-(Digital)-(Nahga-Empire)-015\nI guess blasting Danger into a million pieces wasn’t such a great idea, because now her sentience is in the aether and she can control anything robotic, including the All-New X-Factor’s Raptor.\nPolaris takes off to shut down the All-New Raptor’s guns and Danger confronts Gambit again. Gambit reminds Danger that they worked together and formed a bond and he knows her. (FORESHADOWING!!!)\nGambit lunges at Danger, but it was just a hard light hologram.\nGambit, ever the optimist, believes Danger must remember him and he can get through ta her.\nQuicksilver, Nil, and Jean-Luc evacuate The Stolen Island onto what appears to be a pirate ship from the Middle Ages, but a giant Danger fist KRAKOWWWs down and ruins that plan, smashing the pirate ship to bits.\nPolaris attacks Danger again, but she’s prepared some mental warfare for her this time and makes a hard light hologram of Magneto. This distracts Polaris long enough for Danger to BLAKOWWW her in the back.\nDanger then turns her attention to Nil, but Gambit tackles her and…\nYes!!! There’s the Scumbag Gambit we all know and love!\nHow ’bout that foreshadowing, huh? I mean, I’m not saying I predicted the big man-on-machine smooch, but I had a feeling something was off with Danger the whole issue. Props to Peter David for hinting that something big and strange was coming up, but making the big reveal something actually shocking. I can only hope Peter David saw Her and takes this Gambit-Danger thing as far as it can go. That would be wildly entertaining, as well as ground-breaking and controversial.\nGambit’s magic kiss snaps Danger out of whatever was wrong with her. Nil transfers the money he stole from Serval back to where he took it from. And Gambit tells us who’ll fill in the fourth All-New X-Factor slot on issue #5′s second page!\nThere’s no preview of next week’s cover in this one. Luckily, Marvel.com‘s got one."

On another point of theRaft,Jamesonis assaulted byScorpion, who's more than willing to kill him, only to be stopped byLizard, who reveals that he carries the consciousness of Curt Connors.\nThe battle between Spider-Man and the Spider Slayer escalates, making Smythe surrender, but once he negotiates his surrender, Otto replies that he sticks to his initial offer, taking one of Smythe's own blade to impale him, effectively killing him, making all of the enhancements given toBoomerang(who survived the explosion of his bomb-arangs), Scorpion and Vulture go off. The Civilians regroup with Jameson, Lizard and Spider-Man, who announces Smythe's death and that they're all free now.\nOnce outside, the group rejoices of their freedom, only to bump into Smythe who had one last trick up his sleeve: his Mini-Slayers are keeping him alive, moving his body and his consciousness for his final seconds, prepared to make his final move: Transfer his mind into Spider-Man's body. They both fight, with Smythe wounding Lizard (who was cuffed byShipleyfor safety) and kills Shipley, but once Smythe makes his move, Otto replies that just like all his escape attempts, he was ready. Shocked at another failure, Smythe wonders why this failed, and Otto, now at a safe distance from the rest, reveals to him thathe already pulled that trickrevealing his identity as Otto Octavius to him, who in his shock finally dies, while Otto taunts him that he failed in his final battle and it wasn't against his real enemy.\nOnce aboard the rescue boat, Jameson prepares himself for a press conference, musing that he'll be happy once the Raft is destroyed, but Otto sways him apart and tells him that he should give him the Raft for his new base of operations. Jameson refuses only to be blackmailed by Otto with a recording of their meeting at the Raft where Jameson grants permission to Spider-Man to kill Smythe. Fearing the repercussions (and in the process reigniting his hatred towards Spider-Man), Jameson agrees and makes the announcement in his press conference where he publicly gives Spider-Man the Raft as his new Super Hero Headquarters, which Otto rechristens it as \"Spider-Island Two\".\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:"

Covering for a heedless underling, Spider-Man talks to the police. A piece of Inhuman debris hit the roof of the building. Since it showed no hazardous radiation, the police marked it as a low priority. Now one of the apartments is glowing... and as the hotels and hospitals are already full from the high-priority sites, the people on this street who couldn't get out immediately just have to take whatever happens next.\nObserving the impact site, Spider-Man and his firefighter escort, Lt. Coyle, realize that something has been taken, probably for its resale value, probably by the occupants of the glowing apartment. Moving through the building from the roof, Spider-Man notices that the residents are strangely lethargic, and realizes that whatever is draining power from electronics is also draining energy from people.\nAt the apartment, Spider-Man's righteous spiel is answered by Arthur Schweibe, the husband, wearing half of a set of power armor. Arthur has his own spiel, of how he and his wife played by the rules in a world without rules, and were left behind.\nSpider-Man's web-shooters are failing, as is his strength, but he manages to distract Arthur long enough to find the rest of the armor, attached to Susan Schweibe, the other occupant. Susan has cancer. Arthur couldn't afford to help her, but with this armor, maybe he can heal her. And he will kill everyone in this city if he can bring her back.\nCoyle speaks up, having followed Spider-Man in. He asks Arthur why Susan is asleep. When Arthur is silent, Coyle spells it out: Susan didn't want him to hurt others for her benefit, so Arthur drugged her so she wouldn't stop him. Coyle empathizes, saying he's lost people, but that Arthur seems angry for other reasons. And if he will hurt people for that rage, he's not really doing it for Susan, he's doing it for himself.\nDefeated, Arthur lets go of Spider-Man, who swiftly disables the power source in the armor. He explains that it probably wouldn't have worked, but that he can get Susan an appointment withElias Wirtham, a driven doctor with a knack for unconventional therapies. He also asks Coyle to back up his statement that Arthur was being controlled by the armor, and should be left free to support his wife. Coyle agrees, but asks Spider-Man why he is being so lenient. Thinking back to his final days as Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man merely says that no-one should die alone.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:"

Venom watches in horror as clones of the Venom and Carnage symbiotes merge together and bond to the mass-produced bodies, consuming them like cancer, to Carnage's delight. The Venom symbiote corrodes through the restraints binding Flash and he lands on an operating table across from Carnage, just as the fused clones break free from their chambers.

As the Guardians fight off their enemies, Astro summons more and more Punisher Robots, overwhelming the team, leading Gamora to command Groot to use the overgrown Yggdrasil to defeat them. Contacted by his master, Astro leaves the scene, but not without telling the Guardians his destination: Knowhere.\nAs the Guardians try to return to their base, they discover they cannot teleport back anymore, finding out that Astro attracted them to Asgard to distract them while Silver Galactus was attacking Knowhere. Meanwhile, in Knowhere, Silver Galactus uses his spaceship to invade Knowhere's central nervous system. Surprised by Galactus' attack, Cosmo initiates the emergency locking protocols, teleporting all of Knowhere's inhabitants to a special necklace he's wearing, keeping them safe while he tries to reactivate the station's portal to bring back the Guardians. Cosmo's confronted by Astro, who tells him that Silver Galactus plans to use the Continuum Cortex to have access to all worlds in all universes from all realities to devour them, and then proceed to knock Cosmo out.\nBefore long, the Guardians finally get back to Knowhere, wondering how they got there, but soon they turn their attention to the colossal Devourer of Worlds. While Iron Man (actually Tony Stark's consciousness downloaded in nanite form) send his \"Iron Manites\" (nanites Iron Men) to try to stop Silver Galactus of taking control of Knowhere's Continuum Cortex, Gamora organizes the rest of the team to draw the giant attention. Drax then shoots him, but only get the attention of his herald, Vance Astro. A huge battle between him and the Guardians ensues and Astro is defeated.\nAfter his servant defeat, Silver Galactus decides to act and confront the Guardians. Iron Man tried to reactivate Knowhere's dormant brain, so it could defend itself against Galactus' invasion, but failed. Cosmo then reappears, explaining that Iron Man didn't succeed in reactivating the Celestial because he needed Cosmo's psychic trigger to align to his Iron Manites' wake alert to do so. Together, they succeed in reactivating Knowhere, thwarting Silver Galactus' plans.\nEnraged by his defeat, Silver Galactus prepares himself to punish the Guardians for their defiance, but he's backstabbed (literally) by his herald, Vance Astro, who, glad for finally having put Galactus to sleep, explains it was hard to cheat someone who has Cosmic Awareness. He then reveals he was the one who reactivated the Continuum Cortex to bring the Guardians back to Knowhere in time to stop Silver Galactus and takes off his mask, revealing himself to actually be the until then believed to be dead Peter Quill the Legendary Star-Lord."

However, Otto discovers a minor brain anomaly that would've revealed his condition but no one else seems to notice it, so he takes notes of the results by himself.\nThe Avengers apologize, but Captain America warns Otto that he's on probation and if he keeps on with another brutal assault he will be expelled from the team.Natashatalks to Otto, arguing that she seems to understand his changes after what they had been through when Otto almost burned down the planet (during the events ofEnds of the Earth) and that seems to have changed Peter.\nWhile she tells him that he now carries \"Red on his Ledger\", she lets him know that if he wants to discuss about crossing the line, she'll be there for him.

Peter Parker asks the Kingpin why he killed Eddie, and the Kingpin tells him the first rule of business: eliminate the competition. The Kingpin proclaims the symbiote is his - he paid for the symbiote to be embedded with technology allowing the wearer to control almost any machine on the planet, and that Eddie and Peter's fight was a method of finalizing the symbiote's software. The symbiote bonds with the Kingpin and he punches Peter through the office window and out onto a giant electronic billboard prominently displaying an image of Mary Jane Watson.\nPeter slides down the billboard before finally stopping at the very bottom. The symbiote is now able to travel via technology, and the Kingpin appears through the billboard before Peter, taunting his relationship with Mary Jane and asking him she is \"always a bit out of reach, isn't she?\" Peter is astounded that the Kingpin knows his history with her, and the Kingpin reminds him that with the technology infused symbiote, there is no secret he doesn't know, no place he cannot get to, and no object he cannot control. Peter reminds him this is too much power for anyone and in response the Kingpin hits Peter with a bolt of electricity.\nPeter falls and lands on a car, asking a pedestrian which way north is. The pedestrian doesn't know, and Peter laments the fact that he used to know all this. The Kingpin, controlling the parked cars, detonates them and hurls Peter away, where he lands at the intersection of 56th Street and 6th Avenue. As he tries to head north, the Kingpin uses New York City's technology as a camera and attempts to run him over with a car.\nSuccessfully wall-crawling to the top of a skyscraper, Peter is forced to leap off it when the Kingpin sends a helicopter crashing down on the roof. He moves to Central Park, using firewood to create a burning stick to wield against the Kingpin. The Kingpin appears and with one leap, he embeds the stick in the symbiote, forcing it open and pulling the Kingpin out. As the symbiote burns away, Peter heads to a familiar location to rest.\nAt the former home of Aunt May, Peter reflects on how he lost sight of what was important after gaining power he didn't earn, and as a result he had broken many things. Gathering some sewing equipment, blue cloth, and red thread, Peter recalls Aunt May's lesson: nothing is unfixable, it just won't be easy.

Marvel Girl is given the task of lifting a lid from a box using her telekinetic powers.  Once it is opened, she finds a cake stashed inside! Professor Xavier explains that it has been one year since classes first started at the school, and he felt that the date should be celebrated.\nMeanwhile, four other mutants, known as Toad, Mastermind, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, are seen having dinner.  Mastermind tries to impress the Scarlet Witch, but she is not interested in him.  Mastermind threatens her, but Quicksilver intervenes to protect his sister.  Magneto is elsewhere, seen stealing a freighter and returning it to his secret headquarters somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean.  When Magneto returns, Toad informs him that Quicksilver and Mastermind were fighting.  Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch tell Magneto that they do not want to be members of his group anymore, but Magneto informs them that they are forever in his debt.  The group has a flashback to a town in Europe where Magneto saves the Scarlet Witch from an angry mob that wants to kill her for burning down a barn with her mutant powers.\nMagneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants use the stolen freighter to attack the small nation of Santo Marco in South America. Professor Xavier learns of the attack and contacts Magneto on the astral plane using his telepathic powers. Professor Xavier and Magneto dispute their different views on mutant and human relations; Professor Xavier believes that they should coexist with one another, while Magneto believes that homo-superior should rule the world.  Mastermind creates an imaginary army to frighten Santo Marco's populace so that the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants can easily take over the country.\nProfessor Xavier and the X-Men travel to Santo Marco under the guise of an American professor and his students on a goodwill mission.  Once they are in the country, the X-Men change into their costumes and attack the Brotherhood.  Mastermind tries to scare the X-Men away by creating an illusion of a fire wall in the X-Men's path.  Professor Xavier realizes that the fire is not real, so he enters it to show his students that there is nothing to fear.\nThe X-Men devise a plan to attack the Brotherhood, but do not realize that the palace door has been booby trapped with a bomb. Just before Beast opens the door, Professor Xavier senses the danger and hurls himself in front of the X-Men to protect them! The Brotherhood escape from the palace, but not before Quicksilver disarms a second bomb intended to destroy the entire nation along with the X-Men. Professor Xavier regains consciousness only to learn that his telepathic powers were damaged by the explosion."

X-Men (Part Twelve)\"Appearances·SynopsisWriter(s)Jason AaronPenciler(s)Adam KubertInker(s)John DellColorist(s)Laura MartinLetterer(s)Chris EliopoulosEditor(s)Tom Brevoort\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\n72 hours before the final battle against the Scott Summers, the Dark Phoenix, Tony Stark was informing his teammates about recent events important for the situation they are going through now. He explains the connection between the events of the knownHouse of M, the decimation of the mutant race and the Phoenix Force, which came to Earth in order to restore mutantkind, being responsible for the birth of Hope Summers, who was destined to wield the power of the Phoenix. And finally that Wanda's Chaos Magic and the Phoenix Force are connected in a cycle, as they were Yin and Yang. Stark continues his explanation, stating that he had to look beyond the limits of science, and discovered that the Scarlet Witch and Hope must work together to overcome the Phoenix.\nMeanwhile, Wanda tries to talk with Hope and console her for the guilt she feels for not being able to save her people, and tries to convince her to join Stark's talk. After she tries to calm down Hope, stating that she can not blame herself for what Cyclops and the Phoenix Five have done, Hope looks back to her, stating that she should blame Wanda, principally for the decimation, although she can not hold total responsibility for her actions due to being unstable at the time. When Iron Man and Captain America are about to approach them, they see the two powerful women fighting.\nThe scene moves to the present, when Scott Summers is already the Dark Phoenix, and the Avengers are almost defeated by his power. From the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, the Stepford Cuckoos are telepathically informing the Avengers about the havoc the Phoenix Force has caused around the Earth, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and fire raining. From the Quinjet, Captain America announces to every Avenger and X-Man via radio that \"the Earth doesn't die on our watch!\"\nNumerous teams of Avengers and X-Men are trying to contain the chaos in numerous cities of the planet, such as Paris and Beijing. The battle against Summers is finally moved to the Himalayas, where he blasts Thor away. After other Avengers arrive, and Captain America orders them to take Cyclops down, he creates a massive blast of fire, throwing them away. When Iron Man contacts for more help, Nova appears, and using his powers confronts Cyclops, who was leaving the fight, but is finally subdued. In that moment, Hope and the Scarlet Witch arrive, showing true determination to take him down.\nThe scene moves to when Hope and Wanda started fighting, they were stopped by Iron Man and Captain America, who convinced them not to fight against each other, but together.\nBoth women proceed to beat Cyclops brutally, while Hope remembers her training in K'un-Lun. The cavalry of Avengers arrive to join the fight. In that moment, Cyclops starts remembering his pasts, the values Xavier taught him, his friendship with Wolverine and the apparent death of Jean Grey. After begging for his death, the Phoenix possesses him again, and starts to incinerate everything around him. He has a vision of Jean asking him to stop, and is finally defeated by Hope and Wanda, forcing the Phoenix Force to leave him.\nWhile Hope remembers a talk she had with Captain America after the fight with Wanda, that if they managed to retrieve the Phoenix Force from Cyclops, she should become the Phoenix, the cosmic force engulfs her, and she quickly flies away, with Iron Man following her. She starts repairing the damage Summers caused using the Phoenix's power, and finally returns with the Avengers and X-Men. She says she would keep it, and become the savior she was meant to be. But Wanda convinces her that although she was meant to become the Phoenix, she was meant to let go of the power rather than wield it. Hope, feeling overwhelmed by the cosmic power, allows Wanda to help her undo the damage from the \"No more mutants\" spell. They hold hands when both pronounce the words: \"No more Phoenix\".\nThe cosmic force leaves Hope and disperses around the Earth. Back to the Jean Grey Institute, the Stepford Cuckoos notices something strange with Cerebra, the appearance of new mutants. One young girl rescued by Spider-Man in China is one of the first to manifest her powers. The Avengers and the X-Men are celebrating the victory and the reinforcement of mutantkind when Cyclops recovers, guilt-ridden over the blood on his hands.\nLater, an imprisoned Cyclops is visited by Captain America, the former taking full responsibility for his actions and those of the Phoenix Five. Rogers admits that the conflict was in part his fault, because the Avengers did not do enough to stop the discrimination against mutants, and allowed hate for them to grow. The consequences of the war are shown: Magneto and the rest of the Phoenix Five are global fugitives, Captain America is putting together a new group of Avenger composed of mutants as well, Wakanda is recovering from Namor's attack, Iron Man accepting faith can be combined with science, and Thor offering Nova a spot with the Avengers.\nScott tries to convince Captain America the Phoenix Force arrival made a new age for mutants possible, that sacrifices where necessary. Finally, when Captain America walks away with Wolverine, and while Hope is preparing to fly away from Utopia, Scott says that \"there always has to be destruction before the rebirth\".

When Wonder Man and Scarlet Witch enter the room, Wanda asks Wonder Man to hold her while she recovers from the attack. This causes a jealous streak in the Vision, who sees Wonder Man -- the person whom the Vision's own brain patterns are based on -- as a threat to his marriage to Wanda and attacks him.\nAs the battle rages on, the Scarlet Witch goes to find the other Avengers, who are just recovering from their battle with the Black Knight statue. They arrive just as Wonder Man has succeeded in landing a thunderous blow to the Vision. Iron Man breaks up the fight threatening to suspend both of them if they continue to battle. When Jarvis intervenes with a request for help, he also asks if there is anything he can do to help dispose of the ruined statue of the Black Knight. This leaves Iron Man to wonder what is becoming of the team before calling them all together for a meeting.\nMeanwhile, in a research community in the Canadian Rockies, researcher Franklin Hall, gifted with gravitational powers, has control over the entire community. When it's learned that one of the other scientists named Joe has contacted the Avengers. In an effort to stop such things from happening again, Hall uses his powers to lift Research City high into the air. He then is about to kill Joe when Joe's wife Judy, a woman that Hall favors, begs for him to stop. He agrees and orders Joe be locked up. Meanwhile, another woman, Raquel, seeks to replace Judy as the object of Frank's attraction.\nLater that night, Judy arrives with a costume she designed for Frank, and he explains to her that while working on a means of creating a teleportation system, he was jolted with an anti-gravity that endowed him with the powers he has now. Putting on the costume she has prepared, Franklin rechristens himself Graviton and attempts to seduce Judy. However, with the Avengers sneaking onto the floating Research City, Judy plays along until Raquel bursts in and warns Graviton of the Avengers' intrusion. Graviton uses Judy as a human shield and blasts the Avengers out of his room.\nAs Judy attempts to escape, she is knocked out by Raquel, who sees this as the ideal situation to curry Graviton's favor. As the battle rages on, the Avengers find that Graviton is a challenging foe, as he can alter the gravity of any object. He easily downs the Vision, makes Captain America's shield so heavy that it cannot be lifted and so on. When the Avengers appear to have the upper hand, Graviton makes the roof of the building collapse on his attackers knocking them all out due to the resulting cave-in. With the Avengers defeated, Graviton vows to use his powers to take over the entire world.\nThis story is continued next issue..."

Meanwhile, a fatigued Tigra asks the undead Fists if they are to fight but Hunter's Moon frees himself and assures Tigra that his predecessors won't fight. Speaking in a secret language by Khonshu, he venerates the undead Fists and prays they return to their rests, and they stand down from combat. As Reese moves for the kill, Marc intercepts her and tells her no as killing Zodiac would make her as bad as him. Finally at Zodiac's throat, Marc's efforts to kill him are abated by the assertion of the Steven Grant persona, who is stopping Marc from killing Zodiac in the belief that doing so will lose Reese."

Onboard, Captain America thanks Wonder Man for filling in on this mission while Iron-Man is on leave. The Beast is piloting and warns them they are losing control of the quinjet due to the storm. Wonder Man, who is invulnerable, volunteers to pilot the ship to ensure it doesn’t land on anyone while the rest of the team bails out. Ms. Marvel, Falcon, Cap, and Wasp all jump out but the Beast refuses, insisting on landing it himself. Wonder Man yanks him out of the pilot chair, straps his jet belt onto him, and tosses him out the hatch. Unfortunately, the Beast has no experience using the belt and he careens out of control.\nThe rest of the team make it to the ground but are immediately attacked by Modred the Mystic. Wonder Man does his best to steer the craft but it crashes deep in the woods. As he climbs out of the wrecked ship, he sees Wanda (although she doesn’t appear “onscreen.”) She snares him in a spell, paralyzing him and floating him away.\nModred takes out the Avengers, one by one: Cap, Ms. Marvel, and the Falcon. But the Wasp gets the drop on him, knocking him out. Alas, she is then knocked out with a bolt of arcane energy by Wanda, who has turned ashen white after being possessed by Chthon. Elsewhere, the Beast endures his own crash landing on the mountainside. After dusting himself off, he finds a skull wearing a helmet. The skull doesn’t look human and the perplexed Beast wonders what kind of animal wore helmets?\nSometime later, Chthon and Modred stand before the altar with their captives: Cap, Ms. Marvel, Falcon, Wasp, Wonder Man as well as Quicksilver and Django Maximoff. All of them float in midair, paralyzed.\nWhile awaiting the proper alignment of stars to conduct a conjuring spell, Chthon “monologues” his ancient history: In primordial times, when the old gods were threatened to be replaced by newer ones, Chthon’s sister Gaea infused her spiritual essence to the Earth itself while Chthon inscribed the book of sorcery, the Darkhold, as a means to return to this plane of existence someday and fled to another dimension.\nThroughout the centuries, the evil tome passed through many hands and was used for malevolent purposes. In Medieval times, the sorceress Morgan Le Fay and her cult of “Darkholders” conjured up Chthon himself, expecting to use him as their minion, only to find him too powerful. Morgan and her cult attempted to banish him but only succeeded in binding his spirit to the mountains of Wundagore. Morgan’s repentant follower Magnus stole the Darkhold and placed it in an enchanted tower which only good and noble people could enter. Alas, the human Modred entered the chamber, hoping he could use the Darkhold for good purposes and lost his soul to the demonic being “the Other.”\nMeanwhile, Chthon lingered in Wundagore Mountain as a disembodied spirit, observing the rise of the High Evolutionary’s citadel and the Knights of Wundagore. Chthon observed the birth of Wanda and Pietro and infused the infant Wanda with magical energy. Twice in her lifetime, he caused her mutant hex power to fade, hoping she would turn to witchcraft. When finally Wanda did study witchcraft under Agatha Harkness, she became an ideal vessel for Chthon to possess.\nHaving finished the monologue, Chthon is about to begin a spell to return his corporeal form to Earth and thereby become an apocalyptic menace to humanity. But the ritual is interrupted by a surprise intruder -- a knight of Wundagore? Astride a flying chariot!? The Knight is actually the Beast. After deducing what the skull he was looking at was, he dug up the rest of the skeleton and found the armor and sky chariot. Using it, he snatches the Darkhold away, disturbing Chthon’s spell holding the Avengers in paralysis.\nThe Avengers attack Chthon but he is more than a match for all of them. On the sidelines, Django is watching the battle with dismay when he feels something stir in his coat pocket. It is the marionette of Wanda he carved. Wanda’s soul has been transferred to it once again! Django shouts the news to Pietro just before keeling over. After realizing what he’s saying, Pietro grabs the figurine and attempts to “will” Wanda’s soul back into her true body. He can’t do it himself, but all the Avengers join hands and unite their willpower. This is enough to reverse the possession spell: Wanda takes control of her body once again, while Chthon’s essence is transferred to the marionette. Pietro hurls the figure into the mountainside and Wanda uses a hex bolt to cause a massive avalanche, burying the marionette and trapping Chthon forever.\nThe battle hasn’t come without a toll, however. Django suffers a massive heart attack and dies.\nAfterward, Pietro and Wanda bury Django in the foothills of Wundagore. Without Chthon’s control, Modred has become as mindless as a newborn child. Bova, who was created to care for children, takes custody of him while the Avengers, with Wanda and Pietro in tow, depart."

Quicksilver is skeptical that it was Doctor Doom who place the machine in Wundagore, but Magneto concurs, for Doom's powerful magic could be the reason why they can't locate Wanda. Magneto proposes that himself, Quicksilver and the Young Avengers work together to storm Castle Doom, but Quicksilver and Patriot object to going into a trap and starting a war respectively. Wiccan volunteers to use his magic to get and out of the castle for simple recon.\nAs the night goes on, the searchers decide to turn it. However, Wiccan slips away to enact his spell to transport himself to Latveria, with Quicksilver unexpectedly running up to join him. But the other Young Avengers discover them before they can leave. Hulkling warns Quicksilver that if he even thinks that he can sneak off with Wiccan, then he'll rip his legs off\nMeanwhile, the Avengers have brought in Wonder Man to help in their search for Wanda. Their reasoning is that they can use his ionic energy to locate her. But when Wonder Man asks what they are going to do when they find Wanda, Wolverine's immediately answer is to finally kill her, and Wiccan too. He further goads Wonder Man, citing how she chose the Vision over him. Wonder Man responds by punching him down a level.\nAfter a brief talk with Captain America, Wolverine leaves. After he's gone, Wonder Man states that he will not rejoin the Avengers, especially if they continue to blame her for their mistakes.\nIn the middle of the night, Wiccan decides to head to Latveria alone. When he is discovered by the Doombots, he briefly disguises himself as his own mother, to have them show him to her room. Once his disguise peels off, he is jumped by Wanda herself. When she demands to know what he is doing, Wiccan, unable to come up with the words to say that he's her son, he instead says that he here to rescue her. Unfortunately, he learns that Wanda is going to be married tomorrow. And her betrothed is in fact Doom himself, who enters on cue."

        "content": "The Toy Biz logo\nMarvel Legendsis a line of 6\" (six-inch) action figures that began in 2002. The figures were originally produced by theToy Bizcompany, and later byHasbro.[citation needed]The Marvel Legends figures are not to be confused with the 3.75\" line of toys made by Hasbro beginning 2009, calledMarvel Universe.\nThe Marvel Legends line was originally intended to be a spinoff line fromSpider-Man Classicsline of action figures, but soon became widely popular and massive in span. 16 series were made by Toy Biz, and in 2007 Hasbro bought the Marvel license, producing the line for a few years before production was halted.[citation needed]The line returned in 2012 under the label \"The Return of Marvel Legends.\" In 2014, the line was rebranded into the \"Infinite Series\".[citation needed]\nToy Biz originally included a comic or mini-poster as well as a display stand with each figure. Beginning with Series 8 (and later in Series 11 and 13), they also began a new craze, including a piece of a larger scale action figure with each figure in a series. Build-A-Figure (or BAF) allowed the collector to build an 18-inch action figure that wouldn't normally be able to be sold due to packaging size issues. This trend seemed to be a big hit, and continued in Series 10 (theSentinelseries). However, for unknown reasons, it stopped in Series 11, instead including a type of vehicle relevant to each character rather than a BAF piece. In Series 12 it was back again with a 16-inch Apocalypse figure.\nOther BAF figures includeGiant-Man(Wal*Mart series),Onslaught,Mojo, andM.O.D.O.K..\nWhen Hasbro took over the license in 2007, they started right away including new Build-A-Figures. Series 1 containedAnnihilus, 2 containedBlob, 3 contained theBroodQueen, and 4 contained (Holocaust).\nEarly in the Toy Biz run, (series two), a variation or 'variant' of series one's Hulk was released. It included a torn shirt that wasn't included with the original.\nHowever, another variant didn't surface again until as late as Series 6, where variants ofCable,Phoenix, and Series 3'sWolverinewere released.\nSince then, almost every series has contained at least one variant or 'chase figure' (for example, the Series 5 Red Skull is not on the back of the Series 5 packaging). Some series released a completely different character as a variant. For example, Series 15 Thorbuster Iron Man's variant is theDestroyerfrom the Thor comics, and Captain Marvel's variant is his son,Genis Vell.\nThis was the line that started it all. After the success of figures from the 90's Animated Series, Toy Biz decided to create figures on a bigger scale, more detailed, and more articulated.\nSculptor: Phil Ramirez\nSculptor: Phil Ramirez\nThe Toy Biz Marvel Legends line ran for sixteen series, with releases ranging from extremely popular characters like Captain America and Iron Man to niche and fan-favorite character like Deathlok and Vision.\nSculptor: Phil Ramirez\nSculptor: Phil Ramirez\nSculptor: Dave Cortez\nSculptor: Phil Ramirez\n\nAccessory: Nunchucks, church window base and copy of DaredevilDaredevil#164.\nNOTE: Ultimate Captain America was supposed to have gray pants but the variant and it were switched. The problem was later corrected.\n\nThese figures/boxed sets were only available at one certain store, like Wal*Mart or Toys\"R\"Us.\n\n\nThe boxed sets were a boxed group of figures that pertained to each other, like the Fantastic Four or the Young Avengers.\nAccessory: Photo album of the characters, diorama, 4 bases, bazooka, removable cloth trench coat,  nunchaku, pair of sais, pair of katanas and removable sheath for the four weapons.\nAccessory: Poster boox, 4 display stands, removable trench coat, sunglasses, removable hat, elongated arm with movable fingers, hammer-shaped arm\nThe Icons were lines of two or three 12-inch figures that were iconic in Marvel Comics.\nUnmasked Spider-Man\nThe Face-offs were a hero and one of his or her worst enemies in a two-pack.\nThese series were pretty short running. Fantastic Four only ran for two series, X-Men ran for four, and Hulk ran for two.\nThe X-Men figures sort of ran in two lines.\nHasbro received the Marvel license in January 2007, but they released a few things early.\nAn exclusive Build-a-Figure wave from 2008 that was only available at Target.\nA Walmart exclusive Build-a-Figure wave from 2008.\n\nA Walmart exclusive Build-a-Figure wave from 2009.\nThe Hulk line contained 2 series with one BAF: An enormousFin Fang Foom!\n\nEvery variant character come with a different part to build a different BAF.\n\n2008\n2009\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nFigures with additional accessories and articulation.\nFigures that come packaged with vehicles.\nFigures made with vintage-style packaging based on the earlier Marvel figures of the 1990s.\n\nFigures that come packaged with miniature comic facsimiles.\nWave 1\nWave 2\nWave 3\nWave 4\nWave 5\nWave 6\nWave 7\nWave 8\n2015\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nAn exclusive Build-a-Figure wave released in 2013.\n2015\n2018\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2020\n2021\n2023\n2007\n2011\n2018\n2019\n2024\n2008\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2023\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2023\nAn exclusive Build-a-Figure wave released in 2014.\n2010\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2007\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2023\nA special series of figures released to coincide with the tenth anniversary of theMarvel Cinematic Universe.\nA special line of figures released to promote the 80th anniversary of Marvel Comics.\nA special line released to coincide with the 20th anniversary of theX-Menfilm series.\nA special series mostly dedicated to characters and costumes from prior Marvel Cinematic Universe films that hadn't been featured in previous movie waves, as well as updating iconic characters.\nA celebration of the toy line's 20th anniversary consisting of redone versions of the very first wave of Legends.\nA celebration of Spider-Man's 60th anniversary.\nReissues of figures from the firstBlack Panthermovie.\nA special line celebrating the 60th anniversary ofUncanny X-Men#1.\n\nA special line celebrating the 60th anniversary ofThe Avengers#1 from 1963.\nA line released in 2024 to celebrate the 50 years since Wolverine's first appearance inThe Incredible Hulkback in 1974.\n"

He wonders whether or not the Sub-Mariner is a mutant. Meanwhile, Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants are at their new headquarters on an island, pondering the same thing. Magneto tries to recruit the Sub-Mariner by projecting his astral form under the ocean. Professor Xavier does the same thing from the mansion, but he hides his astral form when he senses Magneto's astral form nearby.\nMagneto finds Namor's underwater kingdom, but he decides not to approach the Sub-Mariner following an outburst that he witnesses. Instead, Magneto approaches one of the other Atlanteans and makes a deal. In exchange for delivering a message from him, Magneto claims that the Atlantean can become the new ruler of Atlantis, if the Sub-Mariner joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.\nBack at the mansion, Professor Xavier informs his students that Magneto is attempting to recruit Namor and that he knows where Magneto's new base is located. The X-Men board a ship and head out to stop Magneto. Namor is persuaded into meeting with Magneto on his secret island. He is quickly impressed by how the island is run using Magneto's powers in conjunction with a giant magnet at the center of the island.\nThe X-Men arrive, and a battle begins amongst the two groups. Magneto destroys the X-Men's ship, but they use an ice-craft to make it to shore. Cyclops realizes that the giant magnet powers everything, so he tries to destroy it, but Quicksilver attacks before he can do anything.\nThe X-Men subdue Quicksilver, which causes the Scarlet Witch to fear for her brother's safety. Magneto becomes angered with the Scarlet Witch and yells at her. At this point, both Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch question Magneto's actions but they continue to follow him. Xavier mentions this may be because they are being controlled subconsciously.\nThe Sub-Mariner realizes what type of man he has allied himself with, so he turns against Magneto and destroys the magnet's controls. The X-Men break into the lab, so Magneto, Toad and Mastermind run away. The Scarlet Witch demands that Quicksilver be returned to her, but the X-Men do not comply. A short battle breaks out and is stopped by Professor Xavier when he brings Quicksilver, under his mental control, to the Scarlet Witch.\nNamor decides that he has had enough of fighting for the day, so he starts to head back to his kingdom when he is attacked by Magneto and his giant magnet. The Sub-Mariner overcomes the beating he is taking and destroys the magnet. The X-Men watch as the Sub-Mariner withdraws back to his kingdom, then observe Magneto and the rest of the Brotherhood retreat in their own jet plane."

She is the nexus being of another dimension with the power of necromancy. Having consumed her own world eons ago, she has since engaged in a campaign to corrupt and usurp other nexi to manifest in and consume their dimensions. Each time she succeeds, the event psychically ripples to neighboring dimensions allowing her to make contact with other nexus beings, explaining Wanda's nightmares. As the nexi cannot coexist in the same dimension, Lore only appears in Wanda's as an intangible spirit, but with plenty of dark powers at her command to make her a threat. Wanda's only hope is her unique Hex Power, which alters probability enough to give Lore a premature physical form in their reality. Supplementing her magic with the martial skills she learned from USAgent to give her an edge, Wanda puts Lore on the defensive. Master Pandemonium breaks free in the chaos and makes one last attempt to grab Wanda and claim the prize of love that Lore promised him, but lets her go at the last moment when he sees Lore betray him and attempt to kill them both. As Lore blasts Pandemonium away, Wanda is reunited with the Avengers, freed from the monstrous forms Lore twisted them into. Even though it seems that Lore's power is dwindling, she remains confident as she is merely marshalling her energies to deliver the final blow on Wanda's reality. In her hubris, she calls upon the spirits of the other nexi she had previously conquered, only to have them turn on her weakened vessel in revenge. Wanda delivers the final blow, hurling an ancient sword that Lore had earlier used to try to kill her with, piercing the necromancess' vulnerable heart. The cosmic threat is ended and the spirits of the nexi are free.\nLater, as she recovers back at home with her team, Wanda reflects on the growth she made in the fight and feels like a better Scarlet Witch has been born anew."

The Young Avengers react quickly to stop him. But the Master of Magnetism reasons that if his twin grandsons wish to meet their mother, then they shouldn't interfere, especially if the two are the only links to his daughter. Patriot voices his opposition, declaring that they are allying with a genocidal terrorist (Magneto corrects former). Magneto admits that what happened to Wanda Maximoff is his fault and his alone and his responsibility to correct it.\nThen suddenly, the Avengers turn up and attack Magneto; Wolverine, in particular, is mad that Magneto didn't heed his warning not to approach the Young Avengers. Wiccan tries reasoning with them all that finding the Scarlet Witch would make things right. Seeing as the Avengers are refusing to listen to reason, Wiccan teleports his team and Magneto to Wundagore, Transia. The dismayed Avengers then start arguing about how to track them and what to do. Wolverine particularly sees this as an opportunity to find the Scarlet Witch and put her out of her misery.\nIn Transia, Patriot voices his frustration towards Wiccan for making them fugitives. Admitting that he's sorry, Wiccan offers to send them all home, believing that the search should be his alone. Hawkeye chimes in that they're a team. Wiccan then changes their attire so they could be a little less conspicuous. As they walk, Patriot discusses with Hawkeye about the right-and-wrongs with their recent adventures. Stature and the Vision, on the other hand, are about what to do if the Scarlet Witch brings back the former's father.\nTheir search first brings them to the grave of Magda, Magneto's former wife. He goes on to explain the origins of his children and their involvement in his Brotherhood of Mutants. To narrow the search, grandfather and grandsons join hands, as Wiccan tries to pick up where the Scarlet Witch is. No sooner than he sensed her, did Speed races into the nearby village, only to run into Quicksilver, who is not happy with his father being here. As Wiccan tries to explain that they came of their own free will, Quicksilver grabs him and races through the village. Speed catches up to him and challenges him to a race.\nQuicksilver agrees to one, only for a promontory to shoot out of nowhere, lifted by Magneto at a far distance. As Speed's bragging and requests for another race are ignored, Wiccan tries convincing his uncle that Magneto is really trying to make up for his past. Quicksilver admits that the last time he allowed himself to believe that, his father tried to kill him. He grabs some stakes and starts throwing them at his father. One of them impales a woman who looks just like Wanda. But it is actually a Doombot, implying that the Scarlet Witch has been Doctor Doom's prisoner the whole time."

On Halloween night, they return to their new home to find Jarvis waiting for them, there to help them get settled and to pass on a housewarming gift from Captain America to Wanda, a Druidic tome he recovered from Greymoor Castle (Captain America#256). Unfortunately, the tome turns out to contain the essence of Samhain, the spirit of Halloween, who senses Wanda's magic as a way to revive himself. Samhain causes three children curious about the new couple in the neighborhood to become possessed by their Halloween costumes and attack Jarvis and the Vision while Samhain himself emerges from the book to confront the Scarlet Witch. While Wanda can't harm Samhain, she eventually realizes he's still tied to the book and uses her hex power to fling it into the fireplace, banishing Samhain and returning the kids to normal.\nAfterwards, Vision and Wanda get another unexpected visitor to their house -- Wanda's supposed father, Robert Frank."

The two teams deduce that Wanda's killer was someone whom she trusted, and who cared for her, someone who left her body where they knew it would be found quickly. They also deduce that the killer was wearing a white cape and that Wanda was killed by strangulation through supernatural magnetiziation, makingMagnetothe prime suspect.\nWhile X-Force, X-Factor and the X-Men investigate Wanda's death, theQuiet Councilconvenes to discuss the matter. An enraged Magneto argues that the Council should resurrect Wanda as not doing so would be risking the safety ofKrakoaitself.Xavierpoints out that since Wanda was long believed to be a mutant,Cerebrohas a back-up (albeit an outdated one) of her conciousness, resurrection is possible, but chastises Magneto for attempting to threaten the Council into resurrecting her.Mystiquechimes in to point out that Magneto is suspicously beligerant in arguing for Wanda's resurrection, despite personally evading X-Factor's investigation attempts, accusing him of covering his tracks.

Rogue herself even absorbs a huge amount of mutant powers to help them win this. As the House of M, minus Magneto, takes cover behind Polaris' magnetic shield, their sister Wanda disassembled like blocks. An enraged Quicksilver presumes that their attackers have caused this. He dashes at Rogue, only to be blasted away by her.\nAbove all the chaos, Doctor Strange's astral form noticed a pink light coming from one of the towers. Phasing through it, he finds Wanda, playing with her twin boys. The body that disassembled outside was actually for show. Strange then tries questioning Wanda if she was the one who created Layla, to which she claims she doesn't know. He then shows her the battle outside, where their friends are fighting. Wanda laments that \"he\" just wanted everyone to be happy. \"He\" was in fact Quicksilver. When he tried pleading his father to do something, Magneto just didn't know what to do. Even Wanda was considering to die. However, Quicksilver convinced her that she can use her powers and Xavier's to create a better world where everyone, including their friends, can have their most greatest desires. Strange relays this information to Emma. But before he could ask Wanda about Xavier's whereabouts, an arrow stabs her in the back.\nThe shooter is Hawkeye, who is angry at Wanda for what she has done. After she removed the arrow, one of her sons renders him non-existent. Wanda then starts having another breakdown, one which she can't control.\nMeanwhile, in the Xavier Memorial Garden, Magneto has found Emma, Layla and Cloak and demands to know why they are attacking his family. Layla panics and her powers accidentally affect Magneto, alerting him to the truth. In anger, he returns to the battlefield to find Quicksilver. He viciously attacks his son, demanding to know what he has done. Quicksilver argues that they were going to kill his sister. Magneto retorts that he only used her and him, something he would've never allowed. He uses huge pieces of metal to beat his son to a bloody pulp.\nSuddenly, Wanda appears and revives her brother. She then lashes out at her father, declaring that they, mutants, are not gods or rulers, but freaks and he chose world conquest over his own children. She then says three words: \"No more mutants.\" In a blinding flash, the House of M world disappears into nothing.\nA flashback in this story affects the chronology of the following characters:\nCharacters in this story also appear in other stories between this issue.

In order to learn who killed him, Wanda questioned his friend Inspector Maki Hokkaido, his lover Noriko Furuya, and his old enemy Jun Yamada, also known as the Black Bullet, before Yamada told her to ask Miles Benchley if Tanaka had any children.\nThen, she confronted Benchley for killing the Aoi Master to take his powers and casting a spell that caused everyone (except for the Black Bullet who had already been under the affects of a spell cast by the Aoi Master prior to his death) to forget about him. Then, Benchley revealed that he made a pact with an oni to get the means to receive the power of the Aoi Master before he used its powers to transform. The powers he got from the Aoi Master were momentarily weak, so he collected Hokkaido, Furuya, and the Black Bullet for the oni to feed from. In order to hurt Benchley but not those the oni was feeding from, Wanda cast a spell of Shiro Maho that purified the lake below them and turned it into the equivalent of holy water, defeating him after he fell in.\nAfterwards, Wanda redirected her attention on her plans to go to Eastern Europe to find both witchcraft's sickness and cure while Tanaka wanted to thank her but continued to lose memory of his past life in his fox form.\n• The murder of a famous warlock takes the SCARLET WITCH to KYOTO, JAPAN!"

Conjuring up Kree ships and Ultron robots, she begins to explain how she blamed the Avengers for the deaths of her twin sons, so she started that events of Avengers Disassembled to send all their sins back at them. Hawkeye, Jessica Jones and Beast then turn, shocked that history may be repeating itself. Jones comments that the Young Avengers found Wanda where no one else could.\nHowever, Beast admits that he found Wanda first and had tea; Hawkeye confesses to sleeping with her. Everyone then becomes shocked at the reappearance of Scott Lang, the second Ant-Man. Wiccan then explains to the newly arrived heroes that the Wanda they met in Transia was actually a Doombot.\nEveryone notices that Wanda has lined up the Kree ships and Ultrons to attack her. They intervene, as Wiccan, with Stature's help (who reveals to her father about having stolen Pym particles from him), to get through to Wanda. He tells her that the Vision is back and that he and Speed are the reincarnations of her sons. Wanda apologizes for not recognizing him and stops. Speed is hesitant to reconcile with her, given that she did cause M-Day and murdered her friends.\nHawkeye calls the other Avengers, informing them of Wanda's rediscovery; Quicksilver is jittery to speak with his sister. When Iron Man hears about Scott, he orders Hawkeye to ensure that no one leaves the grounds of Avengers Mansion.\nSpeed fears that when the Avengers arrive, they will kill Wanda to prevent her from causing anymore damage. Hawkeye defends that murder is not the way of the Avengers. Wiccan counters how Wolverine is intent on murdering Wanda. However, Beast suggests that if Wanda depowered most of the world's mutants, then she could undo it, but only for volunteers. Jones calls in X-Factors so they could locate all the former mutants who've been in contact with them.\nX-Factor is hesitant to help, given the last bit of \"help\" Quicksilver tried to provide with Terrigen crystals that temporarily restored powers to mutants until they couldn't take the strain and exploded. X-Factor turns to leave, but Wanda stops them, insisting that she's only wanting to reverse what she had done. Madrox counters that once everyone hears that she's alive and caused M-Day, every mutant will be out for blood on her. Rictor volunteers to be a guinea pig, believing that he must have his powers back. Wanda succeeds in giving Rictor back his powers, evidenced by the entire building shaking.\nMadrox congratulates Wanda to repowering Wanda, but adds that there are a million more former mutants to help. Strong Guy then takes notice that the X-Men have arrived. Wanda decides to go out and help them grant more mutants."

X-Men (Part Seven)\"Appearances·SynopsisWriter(s)Matt FractionPenciler(s)Olivier CoipelInker(s)Mark MoralesColorist(s)Laura MartinLetterer(s)Chris EliopoulosEditor(s)Tom Brevoort\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nLocations:\nItems:\nThe Avengers are being searched for by the X-Men, who find many locations which they could use as hideouts totally empty, such as the Stark Tower, the Avengers Mansion and the Avengers Compound. Magik is the one who finally finds many of them- Captain America, Iron Fist, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Spider-Woman and Hawkeye- and attacks them along with the other X-Men. Their battle is paired until Tony Stark asks Scarlet Witch via telecom to test her powers against the Phoenix powered X-Men, who are weak against Chaos Magic, like Wanda's, and help Stark to get some data from the clash.\nMagik targets Wanda and attacks her with the Phoenix Force, but Wanda easily repels her. After Vision is apparently destroyed by the united forces of Polaris and Havok, Wanda seems affected in such a way that she blasts Magik away, knocking her out. Emma Frost teleports to the scene and finds, surprisingly, the unconscious Magik. Realizing the danger of two Phoenixes at the scene, Captain America asks for evacuation to Doctor Strange. When Frost is about to attack Wanda with all her power, Hawkeye protects Wanda by stunning Emma with a trick arrow. Angered, Frost proceeds to burn Clint. Wanda tries to help him, but she's forced by Captain America to continue with the withdrawal.\nAfter they arrive to the Avengers' unknown hideout, Stark tries to get some information from Wanda, but instantly she cuts him off, shouting \"Go to hell!\". Cap then tells Tony they have a man down.\nIn Utopia, the Phoenix Five are talking about the burned moribund Hawkeye, who Emma brought there. Scott tells Emma their plan doesn't involve killing people, although Namor contradicts him, stating that this is war. Magik proves Namor's point by telling him her experience against the Scarlet Witch, she saw chaos, destruction and evil in Wanda, and the Avengers must be purged. Scott tells Illyana she's wrong, and orders her to heal Hawkeye, and then put him along the other prisoners.\nBack to Wakanda, Stark and Black Panther are working on the Phoenix-killer armor and some data about the Phoenix, respectively, when Cap arrives to tell them they need some progress with their condition. But Panther tells him his observations on the relation between the Chaos Magic and the Phoenix Force are leaving more questions than answers. Stark states, as well, that they need more time, which Steve replies those aren't the answers he was looking for.\nT'Challa is examining Tony's plan with the Phoenix-killer armor, telling him using it would have a higher percentage of killing the pilot of the suit than redirecting the Phoenix's energy to itself. Stark states that their current situation is his fault, saying he doesn't have any problems if a way to solve it would kill him. Panther smacks Tony and tells him that where science has failed, they could use Wakanda's more advanced culture to solve it, and to search for the solution in the realms of the spirit.\nCap gathers a number of Avengers to talk about their future plans and that they need more time. Doctor Strange suggests to use the enchantments of Ikonn to create an illusion of its carrier as he/she was the Scarlet Witch, and distract the X-Men.\nThe Avengers separate in different teams to wait for the X-Men in different parts of Earth. During the different battles against the Avengers, Scott realizes Scarlet Witch's appearance in various places at the same time must be some kind of magic or other type of trick. During the Avengers' withdrawal, with no casualties or members taken prisoners, X-Man Transonic is teleported to Wakanda and seized by Wakandan forces, allied with the Avengers. In the Arctic Circle, Wanda battles Namor and humiliates him by teleporting him back to Utopia against his will.\nAfter the encounters finish, Cyclops is talking with the Phoenix Five about how unacceptable their non-victories against the Avengers are being, he can't stand not to win a battle while they're winning the war. Angered, Namor walks away, stating that Scott has failed as leader.\nBack to Wakanda, Stark realizes there's a connection between the energies of the Phoenixes and Wanda. In that moment, Iron Fist arrives with the company of the Thunderer. He tells Tony that he knows important information about the Phoenix and how to train Hope. The Thunderer states that \"the fire of the Phoenix will consume you all\" and Danny tells Stark the X-Men would never find Hope in the mystical city of K'un L'un, and he asks if all the Avengers can go there.\nMeanwhile, on a terrace at Utopia, Namor is still angered about Cyclops' decisions. Emma approaches him, telling him she's with him and that she knows where Hope and the Avengers are hiding. While kissing, Emma psychically tells Namor they're in Wakanda, and that she wouldn't tell Scott.\nThe Avengers are planning their move to K'un L'un when a Wakandan soldier arrives quickly and alerts T'Challa about the strange behavior of the river. Captain America knows Namor is there, and outside Wakanda, Namor is riding a giant wave with a full army of Atlanteans ready to attack."

In the center of the ruin she finds what can only be the book that she and Agatha came to find. Reading it, she's soon filled with the knowledge of her nature as a nexus being, a nature shared by others like her in other dimensions, each representing a different unique brand of magic, in her case, Hex Power. These nexus beings normally can't coexist in the same dimension, but she becomes aware of one such being not content to obey these rules, an evil nexus being called Lore.\nMeanwhile, a powerful specter bearing a resemblance to the Scarlet Witch infiltrates the West Coast Avengers compound and takes out Wanda's teammates one by one before they even see her coming. Back in Unity, Wanda finds her way back to the surface only to find the town warped into an impossible nightmare version of itself inhabited by ghosts of her own memories. There, she's quickly attacked by Master Pandemonium alongside the monstrous possessed forms of the other West Coast Avengers."

And who comes out from it is the Professor X, both greet, with the continuation of Magneto showing Xavier the new Utopia the Phoenix created. They discuss about their pasts as they go up, meeting with Cyclops in the top. Scott tells Xavier he knows the reason of his visit, because people are afraid of the power he's wielding. Following, Cyclops tells Xavier what they've achieved with the power of the Phoenix, as each other of the Phoenix Five have used their powers to help the world, to stop hunger, pollution and give free clean energy.\nXavier tells him about how the people are reacting about this, and Cyclops replies that \"mankind will accept future\". The Professor expresses his feeling of like they \"cheated\" to get to this new world, and that nothing was paid, which Scott reminds him the dolorous past of his species, and that he gave Charles his dream.\nIn Avengers Tower, Captain America is talking with a battered Iron Fist about the result of their last mission defeating an Hydra base in Helsinki, they had to face an army of Zzzax-like creatures that had triggered a NATO beacon in Estonia, and as they were being overwhelmed, Colossus appeared and saved them, convincing the creatures to became a source of free energy. When Cap ends transmission, he enters the laboratory of the Tower, where Iron Man, Black Panther, and Beast are analyzing the Phoenix's telemetry, which Wolverine states is Hope. While Black Panther states that the Phoenix Five have used their power to bring positive change to the world, Iron Man and Wolverine start talking about planning to get Hope and confront the Phoenix with lethal means. Beast interrupts them, agreeing with Black Panther's earlier statement about the Phoenix Five and is disgusted that the Avengers are concocting plans to stop and/or eliminate them. He refuses to have any further role in what they're planning and leaves.\nBack to Utopia, Hope is watching from above the place, Cyclops approaches her and tells her she doesn't need to stay, and that she can leave if she wanted to. Then Scott tells her about the Phoenix Force, and that she no longer deserves it and that she would have never been able to do what they did to the world. Hope tells him she still can hear the Phoenix, and that it is still not satisfied with his actions.\nFollowing this, Magik, Emma Frost, Colossus and Namor start disarming the world from Sentinels, armament, nuclear missiles and carriers.\nIn K'un-Lun, Thunderer is on alert because of the Phoenix, and visits an old librarian, asking for the Book of the Fallen, where the story about Fongji and the time the Phoenix came in the 16th century, following the lecture, the librarian states that \"you need the Iron Fist\".\nThree days later, in the White House, Captain America are talking to the President about the recent actions of the Phoenix Five. And that days before, they offered in the UN to continue to help the world in exchange of pax Utopia. The President, while acknowledging all the good the Phoenix Five have accomplished, says that the X-Men are no longer culpable and something has to be done about their actions.\nElsewhere, there's an image of the Phoenix coming, and the Avengers (in their original formation and costumes) being destroyed by it. It's revealed to be a vision of the Scarlet Witch, who says that \"this is what comes next\".\nBack to the Avengers Tower, Mockingbird is reporting to the rest of the Avengers who are in a jet about the conditions of their mission. They are going to Utopia for Hope. Hours before, during the briefing of the mission, Captain America states that Hope is the key to figure out the Phoenix Force.\nWhen they finally arrive over the skies of Utopia, they launch their attack. Emma and Scott sense their arrival, but they don't seem concerned about it. Finally, Cyclops shifts into costume and says they need to handle the Avengers by their own.\nVelocidad tries to defend Hope, but Thor knocks him out and takes her. When Rogers orders the withdrawal, Wolverine smells Cyclops coming. When he arrives, he blasts Captain America. Spider-Woman and Widow tries to attack Emma Frost, but she repels their attack, and when she strikes back with a deadly burst of energy, Iron Fist intercepts it to save his teammates. Surprisingly, the blast didn't affect him, as his protected by a energy shield with the symbol of Shing-Shang, but he's quicky knocked aside by Cyclops' optic blast.\nIron Man and Thor are still protecting Hope, but Scott easily takes off Tony's armor from him with a simple gesture. When Thor attacks him, he manages to stop the Mjolnir and blast Thor away.\nInstantly, Emma detects \"chaos\" coming, and the Scarlet Witch appears. Wanda asks Scott to stop for the good of both human and mutantkind, stating that she has seen what will happen. After Cyclops mentions her they are invaders, she claims they will leave with her. Hope wants to go as well, when Scott reacts, she mentions she wants to go with her, not with the Avengers. Cyclops tries to grab Wanda, but her chaos energy actually hurts him; something Cyclops is surprised by.\nAfter Wanda teleports Hope and the Avengers away, Scott tells Emma he feels that every time the mutants are going forward, humankind pushes them back. He knows that despite all the mistrust and prejudice humanity has inflicted on mutantkind, humans will send their heroes to protect them and do what they think it's right. But he will end it: \"No more Avengers\".\nACT TWO BEGINS!\n• Jonathan Hickman joins superstar artist Olivier Coipel (SIEGE) to launch Act Two of the biggest Marvel event of the year!\n• What is Pax Utopia?\n• The Phoenix has come to Earth, and everything changes…"

Samson is about to tell him that he is planning to leave because Bruce won't allow him to help. However, after Bruce sees the reflection of the Maestro in the mirror and smashes it and breaks down, Samson realizes that Banner needs his help. Meanwhile, Betty Banner returns home after canceling all of Rick and Marlo's wedding plans only to discover that the couple have made up and the wedding is back on. Betty is furious after spending her whole day pleading to cancel all the plans. While at the Four Freedoms Plaza in New York, Captain America pays a visit to the Invisible Woman and the Human Torch. They all agree that they should attend Rick's wedding after all, regardless of the questionable conduct of the Hulk. Back in Reno, the Hulk tells Doc Samson about his experiences in the future ruled by the Maestro. Specifically, he talks about how the Maestro broke his neck, leaving him helpless at the hands of one of his slave women who later raped him. This causes him to suddenly stop his recounting, he leaves telling Samson that looking into Maestro's eyes reminded him of the eyes of his abusive father.\nLater, the Hulk joins Rick, Marlo, and Betty at the airport where they are waiting for the arrival of Marlo's mother Elaine. They are shocked to see that Mrs. Chandler is a much shorter woman than her vivacious daughter. She is impressed with Rick, liking him much better than the \"gray gargoyle\" that she dated previously. When they go to the luggage carousel, the Hulk pretends that Mrs. Chandler's suitcases are too heavy for him to lift, eliciting groans from Betty. While at the Mount, Ulysses and Hector are getting ready to attend Rick's bachelor party. Hector takes this opportunity to confront Ulysses over his dislike of the fact that Hector is gay. When Ulysses tells Hector that his \"choice\" to be gay is none of his concern, Hector says being homosexual isn't a choice, it is who he is. Back at their home, Betty, Marlo, Elaine, and Atalanta wait for the arrival of the other women attending Marlo's Bachelorette party. They are soon joined by the She-Hulk, the Invisible Woman, and Lyja to get the nights festivities started.\nAt that moment at a veterans hall, Rick's bachelor party is in full swing. As the Hulk's allies and superheroes converse with each other, members of the Teen Brigade spike the punch. Suddenly, the party is crashed by a costumed woman calling herself the Ecdysiast, hired by Captain America for the party. Cap thinks he hired a magician, but is quickly horrified to discover that she is actually a stripper when she ties Rick to a chair. The Hulk tells Cap not to tell Betty about this, wondering what she would think about such objectification of the human body. However, the ladies have all gone to a male strip club where they are having a wild time. Suddenly, the party is crashed by some armed gunmen who have come to rob the patrons. Their mistake, however, is in choosing the night the club is full of female superheroes. Later that night, Rick's party quiets down for the screening of a pornographic film. After the Vision uses his powers to fix the projector, they are all in for a surprise when the woman in the film turns out to be Rick's bride-to-be. While at the Four Freedoms Plaza, the Impossible Man shows up to find the place deserted. Finding an invitation to Rick and Marlo's wedding, the Impossible Man believes that his invitation must have gotten lost and plans to show up anyway."

It filled him with respect for the country's melting-pot nature. It led him to pursue citizenship. It is why, today, he is coordinating the defense against a flying volcano island that threatens to destroy Los Angeles.\nToni Ho was the daughter of two Timbetpali academics who moved to Seattle. Her father, Ho Yinsen, left them, moving back to Timbetpal and eventually dying to save Tony Stark. As the half-orphan lesbian daughter of immigrants, high school was socially difficult, but she persevered, showing a head for science and the drive which led her to complete three doctorates simultaneously at M.I.T., and construct the Iron Patriot armor - a fully-nonlethal suit of armor, whose forcefield she uses to hold back the flying island, buying her teammates more time.\nAikku Jokinen is a Norwegian national, bonded to a planet-defending weapons system by the actions of a being named Ex Nihilo. Today, she uses the power of the remains of that weapons system to sneak onto the island, incapacitate the guards, and discover the controllers - the Secret Empire. Aikku is apprehensive about modern America, but her girlfriend and teammates are here, and so she fights.\nDoreen Green is a comp-sci student with dual American-Canadian citizenship and uncanny squirrel-like abilities. When the island launches a flotilla of drones, she and a crack cadre of flying squirrels spring into action to prevent casualties.\nRobert Maverick is a decorated American general who hates everyone. When the science-terror group Advanced Idea Mechanics became a corporation, he watched it get bought out by da Costa and then restructured as the heroic Avengers Idea Mechanics. He watched A.I.M. be declared terrorists by S.H.I.E.L.D. duringthe Ulysses Cain incident, then save the life of the American president. To save face, A.I.M. became part of S.H.I.E.L.D. - the American Intelligence Mechanics. As their first act, they perfected a piece of S.H.I.E.L.D. tech that gave people Hulk powers, testing the first example on Maverick himself. For one hour out of every 36, he is the Red Hulk - and today, he uses his power to destroy the island and save the city.\nSamuel Guthrie is a working-class Kentuckian from a family of rural coalminers. When tragedy claimed his father, he got a job to support his family. When he found he was a mutant, he joined a group dedicated to helping people, where he learned that the highest calling is for people of different backgrounds to work together against hate. Today, the man who taught him that is dead, and hate echoes across America, but he perseveres, because he believes in his fellow man.\nSam is telling this story as part of a video campaign, which Bobbie da Costa hopes to use to humanize A.I.M. to the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. Sam doubts the effectiveness of this plan, and of the A.I.M. team's name - the U.S.Avengers. Bobbie admits it looks clumsy, but he is proud of his country, which he shares with so many people. Despite the state of the present and need for the video campaign, he says, he still believes in the future - just as a future woman wearing the costume and title of Captain America appears before them to ask for assistance.\nThe Golden Skull is a plutophilic plunderer in a near-future America. He believes that nations and brotherhood are lies that people tell themselves. He believes that honest people hold to a simple rule: take what you want. And with the support of a few crack goons, he can make his worldview more real..."

Iron-Man placates the arriving police by stating the Avengers will pay for damages. Captain America introduces Falcon to his new teammates. Disgruntled and embittered, Hawkeye sticks around just long enough to utter a few snippy remarks before storming off in a huff.\nAcross the ocean, in East Transia, Wanda (the Scarlet Witch), Pietro (Quicksilver), and Django check into a hotel for the night. Pietro shares a room with Django across the hall from Wanda’s own. He advises her that she can call on him easily if there is any trouble. Wanda remarks that she feels completely safe as if she’s come home.\nPietro has difficulty sleeping. Despite believing his parents to be the Whizzer and Miss America, he has hazy recollections of an earlier life lived among gypsies and of a pair of adults making him promise to always look after Wanda if something should happen to them. Despite his troubled mind, Pietro eventually drifts off to sleep.\nVery late at night, Wanda's sleep is disturbed by a mysterious visitor, Modred the Mystic. He offers to help her find the answers she seeks but only her alone as the path is dangerous for those without arcane abilities. Reluctantly, she agrees to go with him. Modred magically clothes her in her costume and they fly off into the night. They are seen flying away, however, by a wakeful young villager from her bedroom window.\nModred takes Wanda to the precipice of Wundagore Mountain. She is startled to see the remains of the High Evolutionary’s citadel which have fallen into ruins since he departed the world. Yet still, there are defensive security devices that attack them. Although Modred receives a minor injury from one, Wanda disables it with a hex. They enter the ruins of the stronghold itself and see before them a floating book and altar. The book, Modred intones, belongs to his dark master. Then, Modred fells Wanda with a bolt of arcane energy before relating that the altar... is for Wanda! The mountain is silent except for the low rumble of laughter.\nThe next morning, Pietro discovers Wanda missing. Alarmed, he races around the village searching for her but finds no clue. As he slumps to the ground in despair, a young girl (the eyewitness from the prior evening) tells him she saw Wanda fly up to the top of Wundagore last night. Pietro suddenly recalls that Django said there were lights in the sky over Wundagore on the night he and Wanda were born. He races up the side of the mountain so fast that he isn’t aware of someone watching him. He slams full-tilt into a force field barrier, gets knocked unconscious, and tumbles a good length of the way back down the side of it.\nQuicksilver awakens much later in a small mountain cottage way up the mountainside. He sees a matronly figure who is re-sewing his torn costume and addresses him by name. When he asks who she is and how she knows him, he sees her face for the first time. She is a humanoid bovine and she claims to have brought him into the world!"

In the Avengers hideout, Iron Man tries to convince the Thunderer to close the portal he created to access K'un-Lun, because of the danger it could represent Namor if he access to it. The Thunder denies, telling Stark what costed to bring the portal to existence, then Tony forces the Thunderer to enter the portal along him and close it, leaving every Avenger back for good, before leaving, Iron Man commands Captain America to use their secret weapon.\nThe Wakandans are in peril while their city is being destroyed. Black Panther swears to kill Namor for this. Captain America, on the other hand, is convinced that he could talk Namor down and that he's acting on Cyclops' orders, proving the Avengers right. However, Black Panther doesn't care about who's right or wrong and demands that Cap summon all the Avengers. Steve shouts \"Avengers Assemble!\" as the scene moves to K'un-Lun, where Wolverine and Hope (who entered the portal off-panel) are admiring the city, abruptly, Iron Man and the Thunderer arrive as the portal closes, Logan is informed by Tony about what changed their plans, Namor.\nBack to Wakanda, Namor pitches himself to Captain America, but is slowed down by the latter's shield, and stopped by Iron Fist. Danny is repelled by Namor, who is instantly attacked by T'Challa. After blasting him, Namor warns the Panther about that he plans to kill him, and T'Challa does the same. After Namor remarks his supremacy of power, T'Challa tells him he was just distracting him, in that moment a dozen of Avengers attacks the king of Atlantis. He uses a energy field to repel them, but as soon as he shouts his battle cry \"Imperius Rex!\", he's brutally attacked by all the Avengers.\nAfter a quick recover, Namor breaks Red Hulk's arm and proceeds to burn the rest of the Avengers. In that moment, from above, Thor is about to hit him with the Mjolnir. In the same time, in Utopia, Magneto alerts Cyclops about Namor's actions in Wakanda, immediately Scott announces his team's departure to Wakanda. When the scene at Wakanda in retaken, Thor just hit Namor with his hammer, both start hand-to-hand fighting as soon as Captain America calls the Scarlet Witch to act now.\nThe Witch and Namor start blasting each other, even with the Phoenix's weakness to Chaos Magic. Finally, both Wanda and Namor succumb, but Namor's seems to be more affected as the Phoenix Force manifests in a strange way.\nNamor falls to the ground, finally defeated. Spider-Man tries to remark their victory, but Black Panther can't think of anything but the partial destruction of his nation. The rest of the Phoenix Five arrives, Namor's portion of the Phoenix force is taken away from him and it's bequeathed to the rest of his team, feeling more powerful. Captain America activates a device in his glove which opens a portal to K'un-Lun and he and the Avengers escape.\nFollowing, Charles Xavier telepathically alerts Scott to stop his actions or he will stop them. When all the Avengers finally arrive to K'un-Lun, they reflect about the battle they have just waged. Hope asks Captain America what is the next step in their plan, but he seems totally troubled, as he doesn't know what else to do.\nLast stand in Wakanda as an out-of-control Namor invades this sovereign nation in pursuit\nof the Avengers!"

He then became a member of theYoung Avengersunder the nameAsgardian, before adopting the alias ofWiccan.[12]Kaplan eventually began a relationship with his teammateTeddy Altman, a.k.a Hulkling, aSkrull/Kreehybrid and eventual emperor. After their marriage, Kaplan became the Prince Consort.[1]\nWilliam Kaplan, known as Wiccan, is one of the reincarnated sons ofVisionandScarlet Witch, and is the younger twin brother ofSpeed.[17][18]During her marriage to the Vision, the Scarlet Witch used her reality-altering powers to create twin boysWilliamandThomasfrom two lost souls. LaterMephistoreclaimed the lost souls. However, their souls had been so transfigured by Wanda's magic that they destroyed the demon and dispersed.[19]\nThe soul ofWilliamwas apparently reborn in Billy Kaplan, the eldest of three sons to Reform JewsJeff Kaplan, a cardiologist, andRebecca Kaplan, a psychologist, living on the Upper West Side of New York City.[10]\nBilly had trouble with bullies in school due to his sexuality. Once while sitting in front ofAvengers Mansion, he briefly met theScarlet Witch, his favoriteAvenger. She gave him some words of encouragement and told him that he \"could take care of himself\". Billy took her advice and stood up to his bully,John Kesler. Unfortunately, Billy'selectrokinetic powersemerged for the first time while protecting another student and he nearly killed the school bully, John Kesler. He sought out the Scarlet Witch for help, only to find out that theAvengers had disbanded.[20]\nBilly metTeddy Altmanat school and they bonded over comic books. Billy attended Teddy's football games where he metTeddy's mother. After he almost killed Kesler, Teddy found Billy outside of Avengers Mansion and they each revealed their powers to one another and they kiss for the first time.[21]\nIron Lad, a younger version ofKang the Conqueror, found Billy using theAvengers Fail-Safe Programcompiled by theVisionto be used to form a new team of super heroes in the event of the destruction or disbanding of the Avengers. Iron Lad requested his help in preventing his future self from returning him to the future where he would eventually become Kang. Alongside his new boyfriend,Teddy Altman, Billy joined theYoung Avengers.[21]He chose to style himself afterThor, and adopted the superhero identity of theAsgardian.[2]As Asgardian, Billy choose to use only his electricity based powers, but during the fight with Kang Iron Lad and then Patriot ask him to use his \"other powers.\" Finally he admitted to being a spell-caster and disabled Kang's force field.[22]Vision also revealed that Billy and Teddy are both somehow related to members of the Avengers.[8]\nAfter the battle, fellow Young AvengersKate BishopandCassie Langsuggested that Billy change his code name from Asgardian toWiccanto reflect his new powers and Billy agreed.[8]\nBilly tried to tell his parents that he was an aspiring superhero, but they misread his intentions and assumed that he was revealing his relationship with Teddy (Hulkling). Though his parents thought Teddy would make an excellent son-in-law, they were unaware that Billy was a practicing witch, dating a shapeshifter.[23]The nature of his heroic activities and the danger associated with them, became apparent when the Super SkrullKl'rtnearly destroyed the Kaplan's Upper West Side home in his attempt to kidnap Hulkling. The altercation resulted in the death ofTeddy's mother.[24]\nWhen Hulkling was captured byKree Sentries, Wiccan and the other Young Avengers determine that they would need reinforcements in order to launch a rescue. TheVisionrecommended using the Avengers Fail-Safe Program, which was the same program Iron Lad had used to locate the original Young Avengers.[25]\nStature recognizing that Wiccan and Speed look like twins\nThe Fail-Safe Program led them to high security detention facility for superpowered juvenile offenders, where they foundTommy Shepherdand released him from his cell. Stature noted that Tommy and Billy could be twins.[25]Tommy helped them to save Hulkling by fighting off bothSkrullandKreeforces, afterwards officially joining the Young Avengers under the nameSpeed.[26]\nDuring the rescue, Hulkling saved the life of Super Skrull Kl'rt, and the skrull revealed Teddy's true heritage as the heir to the Skrull Empire and son ofCaptain Marvel, as well as Billy and Tommy's heritage as the reincarnated twin sons of theScarlet Witchand theVision. The currentVisionconfirmed this by pulling up the former Visions memory files.[19]\nDuring theCivil War,S.H.I.E.L.D.arrested the Young Avengers. However,FalconandCaptain Americaintercepted the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which was transporting the prisoners, and Wiccan teleported the team out of the situation, into theResistance Fighters base of operations.\nWhen theRunawaystried to stay out of the conflict, they barely managed to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development in the news, the Young Avengers decided to help the Runaways even though Captain America vetoed the plan. Wiccan used his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believed that the Young Avengers had come to capture them and a fight ensued untilPatriotsucceeded in convincingNico Minoruto stop the hostilities. The two teams were later attacked byMarvel Boy, who captured Wiccan,Karolina, and Hulkling, and almost killedXavin. The young heroes became the prisoners ofthe Warden, who proceeded to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. The boys were rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. Billy came close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stopped him.[27]\nWiccan was among theSecret Avengerswho took part in the first major battle of the Civil War, and was one of the first two casualties.Tony StarkandPeter Parkerrealized that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush. Wiccan andCloakwere both shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriated Captain America. A violent battle ensued, by the end of whichGoliathwas dead, slain bythe cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escaped, but Wiccan was left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side.\nBilly and the other imprisoned Anti-Registration heroes were eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. Teddy's shape-shifting ability played a pivotal role in Captain America's plan allowing him to impersonateYellowjacketin order to free the imprisoned heroes ofPrison 42.\nSpeed and Wiccan searching for the Scarlet Witch inWundagore Mountain\nWhen Wiccan decided to begin searching for the Scarlet Witch, Tommy agreed to join him. The pair searched throughGenoshaandWundagoreinTransiabefore finally encounteringMaster PandemoniuminCresskill,New Jerseyat a former residence of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision. Master Pandemonium offered some information, but did not know the current whereabouts of the Scarlet Witch.[28]\nWhenthe Skrulls invaded Earth, Wiccan joined the other Young Avengers and Runaways on the front-lines of the battle. Wiccan and Speed saved Hulkling from execution and later assisted Xavin to again rescue Hulkling.[29]\nWiccan gathered the Young Avengers together at the Avengers Mansion to respond to wave of supernatural chaos caused byChthon. The team was turned to stone by Chthon's magic, except for Vision and Stature, who arrived too late.[30]\nAfter being disclaimed of his position ofSorcerer Supreme,Doctor Strangevisited Wiccan to discuss his potential candidacy and ability to assume his former role.[31]When the Hood found Strange and engaged him in magical combat to claim theEye of Agamotto, Wiccan aided him, contrary to Strange's orders to flee. Strange teleported away with Billy, and left him before seeking help with the New Avengers.[32]\nWiccan, along with the other Young Avengers, helped rescue the fallen fromAsgardduring theSiege. Together, he and Hulkling also battled theWrecking Crew.[33]\nAfter Wiccan's powers overloaded during a battle with theSons of the Serpent, the Avengers decided to keep him under observation. Hulkling and the other Young Avengers broke Wiccan out of holding and began the search for the Scarlet Witch. Accompanied byMagnetoandQuicksilver, the team traveled to Transia and then toLatveriabefore discovering a depowered and amnesiac Wanda engaged toDoctor Doom. The rediscovery of Wanda did not go unnoticed though, as the Avengers soon arrived on the scene. A battle with Doom'sDoombot armysoon broke out and was only stopped by the arrival ofIron Lad.[34]\nWiccan powers overloading\nIron Lad teleported the Young Avengers and Wanda into the time-stream. They all went into the past, and met the reanimatedJack of Hearts, who was about to explode. After that Wanda remembered who she is, regained her powers and returned herself, the Young Avengers andScott Langinto the present.[35]She then finally confirmed that Billy and Tommy were indeed her reincarnated sons.[12]\nWanda's increased powers were revealed to be the result of her gaining a connection to the life force itself. A ritual intended to undo the Decimation was interrupted by Patriot, leading to the powers being transferred to Doctor Doom. He intended to usher the world into utopia, a utopia in which he would rule.[36]The Avengers and X-Men teamed up to defeat him, in the process, Stature was killed by Doom, and the villain escaped after losing his powers when they overloaded.[37]\nIron Lad proposed to save Stature through the time-stream but Vision refused, ending with both of them battling each other and Iron Lad destroying Vision and then taking off into the time-stream, even after Wiccan warned that this was the moment in time where he became Kang the Conqueror.[38]\nIn the aftermath of the battles, the Young Avengers disbanded and stayed in low profile during the major events that transpired in the world (thespider infestation, the X-Men'sSchismand the resurrection of theHuman Torch). Wiccan fell into a severe state of depression, but Hulkling brought him out of it by proposing to him. However, their moment of joy was interrupted byMs. Marvelwho called them to the Avengers Mansion. After a few words from Captain America all the remaining Young Avengers were officially named as full-fledged Avengers.[38]\nFor a period of time, Wiccan and Hulkling retired from being super heroes. However, they were unexpectedly brought back into the fray when Wiccan, in an attempt to bring back Hulkling's deadmother, accidentally let an interdimensional parasite calledMothermasquerading as Hulkling's mother into their world.[39]\nBilly trying to manipulate reality to make up with Teddy\nThe parasite's arrival had been a consequence ofLoki's manipulations, who wanted to subsequently pose as an ally to Billy and ultimately control him, as Wiccan was destined to become the omnipotent Demiurge.[40]Unaware of the full extent of Loki's intentions, Wiccan and Hulkling allied themselves with the trickster to escape Mother.[41]\nHowever, Loki betrayed Mother, and interfered with the spell, causing it to tie it Wiccan, Hulkling and himself and bring back their dead parents under Mother's influence.[41]They were soon joined by other young heroes, who became infected by the link of the spell, leading to the reformation of theYoung Avengers.[42]When they were cornered inCentral Parkby their resurrected parents and an army of mind-controlled adults only they could see, Loki convinced Wiccan to lend him his power for ten minutes to save them all with his better skill at magic than Wiccan. As soon as Loki was given Billy's powers, he teleported away, leaving the other young heroes to their deaths.[43]\nLoki ultimately decided to return and help the Young Avengers fend off the Mother's army and escape. Mother faded away after the Young Avengers escaped. Loki explained they couldn't go back to any place their parents were or had died (in the case of any deceased parent brought back by Mother) or Mother would return, as her powers were distance-based. The young heroes decided to stay together and travel through the universe.[44]\nWiccan becomes the Demiurge\nIn the next three months, Loki trained Billy to prepare him to fight Mother, with the ulterior motive of gaining his trust. The Young Avengers were joined byProdigy, who informed them Speed had been kidnapped bya strange entity dressed as Patriot.[45]The Young Avengers chased the entity through theMultiverse, and were brought toMother's Dimension. They escaped, but accidentally left Prodigy and Hulkling behind.[46]Using numerous evil alternate version of themselves as a distraction, the Young Avengers distracted Mother and saved Hulkling and Prodigy. Back on Earth-616, Hulkling left the team to figure out if he really loved Wiccan or if it was merely his reality-warping power.[47]\nAn ally of Mother,Leah, tricked Hulkling into returning to New York City, allowing Mother to come back, and threaten to unleash all of the evil version of the Young Avengers to the world.[40]\nLove wins...literally\nSince Billy was still too weak to end the spell which had brought Mother, Loki suggested that he would be able to do it if his body was older, thus making Wiccan age him into a young adult. Unfortunately, Loki's powers didn't remain. The trickster had to resort to a second plan, to turn Wiccan temporarily into the Demiurge. Prodigy called all of the teenager heroes available to fight the army of alternate Young Avengers, while the real Young Avengers took care of Mother.[48]\nWhen the Young Avengers faced Mother, Billy tried to tap into the power of Demiurge, but failed.[49]Once Loki freed Hulkling, Hulkling comforted Billy, and reconciled with him. Their reunion allowed Billy to achieve his full potential, and finally destroy Mother, and get rid of the alternate Young Avengers.[50]Celebrating Mother's defeat, the Young Avengers threw a New Years' party, along with many young heroes that had come to their rescue.[51]\nEventually, both Billy and Teddy went onto full-time heroics, joiningRoberto Da Costa's team ofNew Avengers.[52]After savingParisfrom the Life-Minus entity by combining Wiccan's powers with those of his teammatesSongbirdandPower Man,[53]the New Avengers were atAvengers Islandwhen a group of aliens using both Kree and Skrull technology kidnapped Hulkling, but took Wiccan with him by accident. The aliens, who called themselves theKnights of the Infinite, were Kree/Skrull hybrids, like Hulkling, and wanted to take him to their base in the Forbidden Asteroids to verify that he was truly the chosen one. Hulkling pulledthe sword Excelsiorfrom a stone, passing the test, and the Knights knelt before him.[54]\nWiccan and Hulkling as New Avengers\nWhen Wiccan and Hulkling were taken to the Knights' home,Castle Tarnala, they discovered the corpse ofM'ryn the Maguspossessed by the evil wizardMoridun. While Wiccan tried to heal the wounded, Hulkling and the Knights tried damaging Moridun, but their efforts were all in vain. The creature soon absorbed enough power to grow in size and destroyed the castle from the inside out. Soon afterward, the rest of the New Avengers showed up and joined the brawl against Moridun, to no avail. Wiccan tried to use his powers to defeat Moridun, but failed and ended up hurt. While protecting Wiccan, Hulkling accidentally absorbed an energy blast from Moridun with Excelsior and realized he could use it against the evil wizard. The New Avengers distracted Moridun long enough to allow Hulkling to stab him in the face, seemingly killing the creature. Once the dust settled, Billy decided it was time to change his codename and chose Demiurge as his new one. However, unbeknownst to everyone, Moridun had managed to infect Wiccan, and remain inside his mind as sort of a subconsciousness.[3]\nMany years intothe future,Moridunhad killedDemiurgeafter feeding off his body and powers until only he remained. Moridun then began using his new powers to wreak and destroy all of reality. TheAvengersof this future tried to stop Moridun but failed and three of their members were killed. To prevent their horrific future from taking place, the future Avengers traveled into the past and stopped Moridun from taking control of Demiurge.[55]The future Avengers arrived on the Avengers Island of the New Avengers. The futureCaptain Americaexplained the situation to the New Avengers. Then, Demiurge arrived and confronted the future Avengers, under the influence of Moridun. This led to a fight between the two Avengers teams over what to do about Demiurge. Hulkling was able to reach out to Demiurge in his mindspace, prompting the young hero to fight against Moridun's control and ultimately expel the evil wizard from his mind. Demiurge's victory over Moridun caused a temporal divergence that sent the future Avengers back to their future, a now peaceful one.[56]\nWhen A.I.M. decided to rescue and shelter hacktivistRick Jones,Sunspotdecided to put to vote this decision, which would be considered an act of war against both S.H.I.E.L.D. and theUnited States. The three members that opposed the idea, Billy, Hulkling andSquirrel Girl, were all exiled from A.I.M. for their own safety, and had the name of \"New Avengers\" bequeathed to them so they could continue operating on their own.[57]This new smaller incarnation of the New Avengers confronted thePlunderer, an adventure after whichHawkeyejoined their ranks,[58]and assisted numerous other heroes in fighting theCelestial Destructor, with Billy helpingDoctor StrangeandScarlet Witchto banish it.[59]Billy and his team were soon pulled back into A.I.M.'s world when theySunspotrequested their help.[59]Once the New Avengers freed A.I.M. agentSongbirdfrom S.H.I.E.L.D. captivity,[60]they assisted A.I.M. in fending off an attack from theNew Revengersat theirAvenger Base Twoin theSavage Land.[61]\nThe Kookie Quartet\nWhen Sunspot set out to shut down rogue A.I.M. splinter cells, he requested Wiccan's and Hulkling's help, and lured them to an empty luxurious apartment inCentral Park, under the pretense that said location housed the headquarters for one of the cells. When the two young heroes arrived there, they found a note from Sunspot, which revealed the apartment was a parting gift for their help. With Hawkeye having left the team after being put on trial for the murder ofBruce Banner,[62]and Squirrel Girl deciding to rejoin A.I.M. to keep an eye on Sunspot, Hulkling and Wiccan decided to disband the New Avengers and focus on their personal lives for the time being.[63]\nWhile at a concert, Wiccan and Hulkling came acrossDeath's Headwhich led into a fight and Wiccan used a spell to lock him up in their bathroom. Back at the house, Death's Head attacked them and revealedanother Death's Head bot[64]that Wiccan stole from an A.I.M. lab under the control ofDr. Evelyn Necker, in hopes of becoming an Avenger again. They call Kate Bishop for help to take \"Vee\" back into the lab.\nOnce they get to the lab,[65]they are attacked by a security robot that Dr. Necker designed and theFearmongers,[4]while she takes control of Vee but is saved by Billy, Teddy, and Kate and they free all the Fearmongers to live a normal life.[66]\nAfter being set up theVridai, Wiccan became part of a team calledStrikeforce. Unable to visit Teddy due to the weird circumstances of the mission, Wiccan helped the team find a new home for the Vidrai, who had been left without one after the War of Realms. Along with Strikeforce, he made sure they had a chance for a new beginning atDeadpool'sMonster Islandand, in the end, was invited by the Avengers to become part of a Black Ops team, an offer he refused, claiming to miss Teddy.[67]\nWhile Billy was away for his continued adventure with Strikeforce, Hulkling had been approached by representatives of aKree/Skrull Allianceto use him as a figurehead to cement this coalition, since he was the prophesied unifier of both warring species. The Alliance forbade Hulkling's relationship with Wiccan since he was an Earther,[68]prompting the two of them to set up a hasty wedding in secret before Teddy had to leave to space.[69]The Alliance's formation was prompted by the retaliation against both the Kree and the Skrull by the plant-based race called theCotati, who proceeded to invade the Earth to turn it into the centerpiece of their empire.[70]\nWiccan and Hulkling's royal wedding\nDuring the Alliance's war against the Cotati, Hulkling was abducted by his own grandmother, former Skrull empressR'Klll, who impersonated him to authorize the deployment of a Sun-detonating weapon named thePyre, which Teddy had refused to use. When Captain Marvel and the Human Torch tipped off Billy that something was wrong with Teddy,[13]he used magic to locate Hulkling and bring him to confront R'Klll.[69]Since R'Klll had triggered the Pyre already, Wiccan used his magic to assist Captain Marvel and the Human Torch in containing the detonation until the device was remotely disabled by Tony Stark. Hulkling defeated R'Klll, and Earth's heroes defeated the Cotati. In the aftermath of the war, Wiccan and Hulkling redid their wedding in the Alliance's flagship with a royal celebration, and Billy was formally inducted into the Alliance as prince consort and court wizard.[1]\nAs regents of the new Kree/Skrull Alliance, Teddy and Billy took part in several galaxy spanning events. When thesymbiote godKnulltried to take over the galaxy, he sent the symbiote-possessed members of an Alliance expedition to kill Hulkling. Hulkling and Wiccan were honeymooning atStarbeacheswhen the planet was besieged bySymbiote Dragonsand the symbiote-possessed crewmates. With the help of Wiccan andAccuser Lauri-Ell, Hulkling managed to conduct a mass evacuation of Little Chandilar's patrons, leading their fleet of ships to safety.[71]\nWiccan has a wide range of superpowers, derived from an unconfirmed source. His origins make it possible Wiccan is bothmageandmutant.[5][36]His abilities were first triggered when the Scarlet Witch (under the influence of the Life Force) used her powers to heal him.[20]However, even accepting that Wiccan is the reincarnated son of the Scarlet Witch, where exactly his powers come from is unclear. If his was purely a spiritual reincarnation, then he would not necessarily inherit his mother's mutated genes. Wiccan's power might also be a purely mystical birthright, or derived from Wanda's status as a nexus being.[72]Wiccan's destiny as the Demiurge resembles the fate that the Time Keepers worried about if Wanda ever had children.[73][46]\nWiccan has demonstrated the following powers:\nSpeed and Wiccan finally reunited with their mother, theScarlet Witch\nHulkling and Wiccan facing theirAlphacounterparts"

The party heads to the Danger Room where Hank McCoy explains that it is a gymnasium and that the lack of all furnishings is because they are receiving new equipment. While the group goes into the lunchroom, Scott Summers is accidentally trapped in the Danger Room, and a program designed for the Beast starts automatically.  He escapes the obstacles that the Danger Room presents by destroying them. Outside of the Danger Room, Jean's parents are unaware of anything out of the ordinary, and they leave.\nBut nobody noticed one of Magneto's henchmen, Mastermind, searching for the X-Men's headquarters! After a few minutes, he calls Magneto to pick him up; the X-Men are not nearby. On Asteroid M, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch ask him why it is so important to find the X-Men, so Magneto explains that as long as the X-Men are around, they will intervene in his plans for mutants to rule the world.  He then explains that he has devised a new plan in order to coax the X-Men out of their HQ.\nBack at the mansion, Scott ponders a plan to stop the Brotherhood when Bobby asks if he'd like to watch a track meet. Scott yells at him for not caring about the Professor. While Jean covers Professor Xavier with a blanket, Hank and Warren join Bobby by the television, along with Jean and the Professor. There is a contestant that wins the track meet using incredible jumps, so the crowd turns on him because they believe he is a cheater.  The X-Men realize that the contestant is a mutant, so they head out to help him.\nOnce they rescue the mutant from the angry crowd, the X-Men escape to the subway. As they arrive at the next station, the Beast realizes something familiar about the mutant. The Beast pulls off a mask to reveal that it is actually the Toad, another one of Magneto's henchmen. The whole Brotherhood then arrives to attack the X-Men, and Magneto captures the Angel. The Brotherhood flee with Angel, but they are forced to leave Toad, who was captured by the X-Men. Back on Asteroid M, Magneto interrogates Angel as to the location of the other X-Men, but Angel refuses to tell him. Magneto then attempts to brainwash Angel.\nThe X-Men try to decide what to do with Toad when he suddenly falls into a trance. His only thoughts are that he has to return to Magneto, so he pulls out a communicator and summons a capsule from the sky. The X-Men follow the Toad, in order to find Angel.  They appear on Asteroid M, to the Brotherhood's surprise.  Magneto attempts to kill the X-Men with the push of a button, but the console is sabotaged by the Scarlet Witch because she cannot tolerate murder.  Magneto and the two siblings argue over their loyalties, giving the X-Men time to free the Angel and attack!\nThe fighting causes some extensive damage to Asteroid M, which causes it to start to fall apart.  Cyclops is trapped in a section of the asteroid that breaks off right away. Iceman has to create an ice tunnel so that Angel can rescue Cyclops.  Before the asteroid is fully destroyed, the X-Men use the capsule to return to Earth. Upon returning to the mansion, they try to tell Professor Xavier what had occurred.  Professor Xavier informs them that he was able to follow everything because he did not lose his telepathy! Since the X-Men performed this solo mission perfectly, they passed their final exams and their training is over."

Magneto pleads with her not to do this but she brushes off his concerns. As she leaves, Magneto looks to his helmet that blocks out telepathy.\nBack in K'un-Lun, Cyclops is practically wiping the floor with the Avengers.

Unfortunately, the dragon is far too young to put up a proper fight and its riders are dislodged.

Wanda finds this hilarious, and she and Vision laugh together.\nLater, the Vision and the Scarlet Witch are hiding behind a tree kissing while their fellow Avengers are in a battle with Count Nefaria. The Scarlet Witch tells them to stop so they can help defeat Nefaria, as tomorrow is their off day. Vision warns her of the expression “Tomorrow never comes”, but Scarlet Witch replies that for a witch, it always does. They then say they love each other just before heading off.\nSometime after that, the Vision and Wanda host a dinner with their found family: Whizzer, Bova Ayshire, Agatha Harkness, Quicksilver, and Wonder Man. The latter toasts the couple for bringing them all together.\nAfter the dinner, Vision and Wanda are about to go out when Vision notices the everbloom tree. Wanda explains its clairvoyant properties, and Vision curiously asks if they should try it. Wanda says they don’t need to, as she also has seen Vision in her future, and Vision says he has seen the same.\nAfterwards, Wanda tends to their two “kids”, Tommy and Billy. She rambles on about a blanket Cap gave them, before Vision is forced to confront her about their fabricated existence. Wanda responds by angrily lashing out at Vision, calling him a “toaster” and saying he isn’t real, before stomping off.\nFurther later, Wanda, Tommy, and Billy are confronted with White Vision. When they ask why Vision is white, Wanda insists he tell them the truth. Vision states that his hardwiring has been replaced, and then coldly states he is neither their father nor Vision’s husband. When Wanda weeps about how Vision used to be kind, Vision can only say that the truth IS kind.\nNot long after, Wanda is in a catatonic state. White Vision tells her that, in order to protect her from Mephisto, she will have her memory wiped of everything relating to Tommy and Billy, while also revealing he will leave the West Coast Avengers to rejoin the main branch. He says goodbye while telling her that the future is here.\nFinally, after being restored, Vision phases in on Wonder Man’s and Wanda staringly lovingly at each other. He prepares to walk away, but Wanda follows him. Thinking she wants to apologize for moving on, he initially refuses, but she says that she wants to give him a gift. It turns out to be a gem containing code from Wanda’s brainwaves, similar to the one from Simon’s brainwaves that created Vision; she hopes that with it, Vision can find someone suitable for him. Vision is speechless by the gift, with Wanda making a humorous remark on it, and the two part on good terms.\nIn the present, Vision and Virginia are in bed together. Vision proceeds to tell the same joke about the toasters to Virginia, only for the joke to fall completely flat. The Scarlet Witch then comments about the cyclical nature of the whole situation.\nA NEW STORY STARTS NOW!\n• Once upon a time a robot and a witch fell in love. What followed was a tale of the dead and the dying, of the hopeful and the lost, of the wronged and the avenged. And in the end, after both had fallen, the witch and the robot rose from their dirt and eyed each other across a field of blood and bone."

The island has two major cities,Carrion CoveandHammer Bay, the capital city.[6][7]Its landmass covers 1,286 square miles.[8]\nThemutantknown asMagneto, with support from theUnited Nations, officially took control of Genosha from itshumanoppressors and turned it into what he claimed to be a \"mutant haven,\" \"promised island,\" and \"mutant utopia.\"[9][10][11][12]At its height, Genosha was home to almost the entire mutant population ofEarth.[13]However, the mutant nation of Genosha was attacked byWild Sentinelsand its mutant population was slaughtered in the worst act of genocide in all of mutant history.[12]A total of 16,521,618 mutants out of the world's 17,508,236 mutants lost their lives in the massacre; thus, the mutant population of Earth was reduced by over 94%.[13]\nThe global mutant population never recovered from this until 15 million dead Genoshan in the Wild Sentinel massacre was resurrected by theFourin theWhite Hot Room.[14]Mutants later suffered yet another near-extinction event onM-Day(which also took place on Genosha).[15][13]Mutantkind would not prosper again until the next attempt at a mutant nation on the island ofKrakoa.[16]\nGenosha was uninhabited throughout most of recorded history. It was discovered by Europeans in the 16th Century and later landed on by both the Dutch and the British East India Company. A transit point for trade betweenAfricaandAsia, the island was occasionally used by pirates until the French began to take control. After a conflict with the French, the British controlled the island in the 18th Century.\nFlag of Genosha\nGenosha became a crown colony in the Early 20th Century. It became an independent state in the 1960s.\nGenosha became a thriving country, one of the richest in the world. However, the nation's wealth was due to using mutants as slaves. The government tested their citizens, and any mutants were stripped of basic rights.\nGenosha advertising its freedom\nMutants in Genosha were the property of the state and children who were positively identified with the mutant gene were put through a process which stripped them of free will and were made into \"mutates\". Developed by theSugar Manand given to theGenegineer, the process was capable of modifying certain mutant abilities in order to fulfill specific labor shortages.[17][18]\nThe foundations of Genoshan society were upset due to the efforts of outside mutant interests. Some members of the X-Men, (Wolverine,Rogue, and their allyMadelyne Pryor), were kidnapped by Genoshan Magistrates under the order of the Genegineer.[19]\nLater, the X-Men and their allies rescued their teammates,Storm,Meltdown,Rictor, andWolfsbane, from Genoshan brainwashing, toppling the government after discovering their alliance with former X-Factor ally turned mutant hater,Cameron Hodge, and thatHavokwas one of the Magistrates since having his memory wiped by the Siege Perilous. Havok himself, woken from his conditioning by his brotherCyclops, killed Cameron Hodge in the process. Another ally, a member of the New Mutants namedWarlock, was killed by Cameron Hodge. The news of this death was broadcast worldwide.[20]\nA new Genoshan regime that promised better treatment of mutants was put in place after Hodge's destruction. A period of general turmoil and a number of attacks by superhumans (includingMagneto'sAcolyteswho were unwilling to forgive the former Genoshan government for its crimes against mutants) followed. The government X-Factor, including Wolfsbane, later returned to the island to help restore peace between its government and a rogue group of super-powered beings that had fled the island. The Genoshan government tried to undo the ill effects visited upon Wolfsbane.[21]\nUnfortunately for Genosha's new government,Fabian Cortezhad need of their country. Seeking a safe zone to hide in after betraying Magneto and the Acolytes, Cortez used his natural charisma to rouse the Genoshan Mutates into an uprising against their human oppressors. The existing government was horribly murdered, and street-fighting broke out between the Mutates and the Magistrates. Cortez was eventually killed, but the damage was done -- Genosha was at war with itself.[22]\nTheUnited Nationsceded the island nation to the powerful mutant Magneto after he demanded an entire mutants-only nation. Magneto and his Acolytes managed to reestablish a modicum of peace and stability only briefly until civil war broke out between him and the remaining human population on the island led by the Magistrates. Magneto eventually defeated the Magistrates and restored order to most of the island, with hold-outs briefly remaining at Carrion Cove before being obliterated.[23]\nThe elimination of theLegacy Virusgave Magneto a freshly healthy army, leading him to declare a campaign of global conquest. A small team of X-Men stopped this plan, badly injuring Magneto in the process.[24]\nProfessor Xremotely viewing the Genoshan mutant massacre byCassandra Nova'sWild Sentinels\nThe entire island was reduced to rubble and its mutant population was slain byCassandra Nova'sWild Sentinels.[12]There were very few survivors, many evacuated, and the Brotherhood of Mutants turned one of the Sentinels into a memorial statue. Foreign military forces threw up a cordon around the island; no one got in and those trying to leave were fired upon.[25]\nMagneto andXavierjoined forces to rebuild Genosha. A few survivors and newly arriving mutants who wished to help with the rebuilding process remained on the island includingCallisto,Freakshow, andWicked. There was a conflict with Magistrates, the island's former law enforcement. Though they were assisted by humanoid creatures they referred to as 'trolls', the Magistrate's forces were driven off. Some of the Magistrates were captured and kept in the island's makeshift jail, while others agreed to work with Xavier to rebuild the island.Unus the Untouchableand his squadron of mutants remained a problem, as they didn't wish to be part of Xavier's group.[26]\nMagnus, Wanda, Pietro, Lorna, Billy, and Tommy as the royal Magnus family (\"House of M\") of Genosha\nAfter the Scarlet Witch's nervous breakdown, Magneto snatched Wanda from her battle with her fellow Avengers and brought her to Genosha, where he asked Xavier to restore the Scarlet Witch's sanity but to no avail. Xavier could not help her and, concerned for the threat to reality that Wanda posed, Xavier consulted the Avengers and the X-Men about what to do with Magneto's daughter. Their decision was rendered moot, as by the time they reached Genosha, reality altered around the heroes and became a world ruled by the House of Magnus (\"House of M\"). While conventional reality was eventually restored by Wanda, millions of mutants lost their powers or died when she uttered \"No more mutants,\" leaving only a few hundred mutants alive and powered. Just like most of his new Genoshan allies and enemies, Magneto was among the de-powered people, remaining trapped on the island.[27]\n\"No more mutants\"\nQuicksilver stole theTerrigen Crystalsfrom theInhumansin an attempt to restore his old powers and to restore the powers of other mutants depowered by M-Day. The theft led to a conflict on Genosha between the re-powered mutants (whose powers came back as too powerful for their own good), the Inhumans, and the U.S. Office of National Emergency (O.N.E.). The conflict ended with the re-powered mutants surrendering and O.N.E. confiscating the Terrigen crystals, to whichBlack Boltresponded by verbally declaring war on the United States.[28]\nEnergy cannot be created nor destroyed, and the same held true for the energies of the numerous depowered mutants. Eventually, these energies gathered in the form of an unsuspecting energy-absorbing mutant namedMichael Pointer. “The Collective” fought the Avengers, traveled to Genosha, and reached out to the startled Magneto.

Wanda and her mother walk to the gypsy encampment past a group of modern tourists to greet the Gypsy Queen. Though appearing to be an old woman, once inside the wagon the Queen reveals herself to be a much younger woman. She wears theSerpent Crownand shows Wanda theBook of Cagliostroand bids the wagon driver to take them to Castle Russoff.\nAt the same moment inMorocco, the wizardDamballahgreets the fakirTaboo, keeper of theDarkhold. Taboo shows Damballah a vision of of the three Eastern European witches, Lilia, Margali Szardos and Maria Russoff, as they discuss the coming portents around Wanda, predicting she will be a major force of Arcana. They observe friction arising among the three witches over Lilia’s increasing possessiveness of the Serpent Crown. Because Lilia has the Serpent Crown the two mages believe that young Wanda’s ascension will further Set’s interests instead of their own patron deity Chthon’s. They decide to battle the witches. Taboo opens a portal to Castle Russoff.\nIn the castle, the three witches invite Wanda to live in Castle Russoff with them, telling her she is destined for great things. They join Gregor Russoff (the wolf) in the courtyard just as Taboo and Damballah teleport in, aiming to abduct Wanda. Damballah tries to take the Serpent Crown from Lilia’s head, but Maria conjures a squadron of skeletons to fight him off, but he counters with a number of giant snakes. The Werewolf joins the fray too, but the fight is quickly ended by a magical blast from young Wanda, casting her first hex. This causes the Elder GodChthonto manifest; he speaks through the Serpent Crown and through each of the sorcerors present, saying that a great sorceress has awoken and she is not to be claimed by any group of coven, and that the Serpent Crown shall revert to the ice, and that all present will have children of occult significance.\nThe witches confer, and decide that Wanda is best taught the arcane ways byAgatha Harknessin America.

When Ian makes a move toward it, Llyra stops him and threatens to kill him. He says she is nothing but a servant of Nagala’s, which angers her. When Nagala comes to challenge him too, he binds them both with seaweed. They easily tear free, but he gives Nagala pause when he mentions to Ebon Rose in his possession, a sister artifact to the Serpent Crown. If its power were added to the Seprent Crown, Nagala says it would make her more powerful than Set himself. This blasphemous statement enrages Llyra, who attacks her, tearing the crown from her head.\nAs the two are fighting, Ian McNee makes off with the Serpent Crown, using the Winds of Watoomb to propel himself to the surface, where he realizes he has one more challenge to face."

The next day, Wanda is training her physical combat abilities with USAgent when a host of demons attack the WCA compound. The demons are searching for Wanda and have an apparent connection to the presence in her dreams. Recognizing their weakness to iron, the Scarlet Witch transmutes War Machine's armor to turn the tide of the battle and the demons are driven off, though her own worries are significantly escalated.\nTouching base with Agatha, Wanda learns she's found a lead in a private library in an abandoned New England town called Unity. Wanda sets off to meet Agatha there and together they delve into the mysterious church basement looking for old mystic tomes. Shortly after splitting up, Wanda runs into another occupant of the library. Declaring that he's been awaiting her arrival, the figure reveals himself to be a much more demonic revived Master Pandemonium."

Reed informs him that everything has been quiet for the last 28 days, and there are no incursions slated for the next 12 hours. Reed also updates him on the status of the Illuminati's prisoners. Black Swan has been reading a lot and been made to spend time with all of the Illuminati members in shifts (except for Doctor Strange, who refused), while Terrax has not moved an inch and refuses to speak. He then fills Tony in on the status of the Illuminati members, telling him that Beast has undergone a radical physical transformation, and is teaching Black Swan latin, and being taught three unknown languages in return. Doctor Strange has been out of touch for a week, supposedly \"indisposed\". Reed suspects that something is going on in Attilan, but has been unable to investigate, due to being pre-occupied with a much bigger problem, the escalating conflict between Wakanda and Atlantis.\nIn the Necropolis, Namor approaches Black Panther, and tells him that Wakanda cannot win a war with Atlantis because of traitors in their midst who have been reporting the actions of Queen Shuri to Atlantis. He tells Black Panther that he wants to offer Wakanda favorable terms in exchange for peace and a cessation to hostilities, asking him to support the suggestion in the Wakandan council, since the two of them have better things to do than warring with each other. Black Panther agrees to consider it.\nIn Latveria, Doctor Strange and Reed Richards have been invited to dinner by Doctor Doom. In the midst of enjoying their meal, Doctor Doom reveals the reason for inviting them there. His surveillance caught the Illuminati on Latverian soil, and he demands to know what game they are playing, and the nature of the invading creatures that attacked his country. Reed tells him that there is no game, because games have winners and losers while this will have only losers. He thanks Doom for dinner, and warns him not to contact him about this matter again, before departing with Strange.\nIn Attilan, Black Bolt's wives discuss the rumors surrounding their husband, and his absence. Together with his brother Maximus, Black Bolt builds a machine in secret.\nIn the Necropolis, Black Panther asks Reed's advice for what to do regarding the peace, stating that he does not trust Namor, and has vowed to kill him. Reed tells him that with what is at stake, the peace is necessary. Black Panther agrees, and when the time of the council meeting comes, he argues in favor of accepting the peace and ending the war, arguing that there is nothing to gain from war, and that he will personally make Namor pay for his crimes. General H'llah argues that Wakanda has lost honor because of Namor's drowning of the city, and needs to show the world that they are not weak by sending a message. T'Challa disagrees that this is necessary, and reiterates that if Wakanda strikes at Atlantis now, the war will not end until one of their nations have fallen. Queen Shuri decides to ignore her brother, and tells the general to prepare his armies for war.\n“WHY NOT WAR?”\n• The cold war between Atlantis and Wakanda heats up.\n• Who is the secret member of the Illuminati that many of the members do not know about?"

Afterward, he informs them that they must continue their fight against evil mutants without him, while he takes care of some unfinished business.  He tells his students that he will select a new leader from amongst them soon.\nFirst appearance of Cerebro\nAcross town at another mansion, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants regroups.  Mastermind and the Scarlet Witch are the first to arrive.  Mastermind offers the Scarlet Witch a life of luxury, but she refuses since she cannot stand him.  Magneto and the rest of the group arrive.\nBack at the school, Professor Xavier asks Cyclops to accompany him to a previously off-limits section of the school.  There he shows Cyclops his invention, Cerebro, which is used to detect mutant brainwave activity.  Cyclops wonders why a telepath such as Professor Xavier would need such a device, so Professor Xavier informs him that it is intended to be used by the new leader of the X-Men, Cyclops.  Cyclops questions his mentor's decision, considering Angel's aggressiveness and Beast's intelligence, so Professor Xavier informs him that it is because of Cyclops' leadership abilities.  The next morning, the X-Men awaken to learn that Professor Xavier has already departed.  They congratulate Scott on becoming their new leader.  The group goes to New York City that night to celebrate, but Scott refuses, saying that he has to stay and monitor Cerebro.\nAt a carnival, Magneto seeks out the Blob, suspecting that he is a mutant, due to his inability to be moved by an elephant or a cannonball.  Magneto tries to perform a mind probe of the Blob, but is stopped by a mental block put on him by Professor Xavier.[1]Suddenly the Blob's manager appears and tries to fend off Magneto, not wanting him to talk to his client.  Magneto orders the Brotherhood to attack the carnival workers.  They all run off, leaving Magneto alone with the Blob.  Magneto orders the Blob to join the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.\nAt first the Blob refuses and attacks Magneto. Magneto then magnetically lifts pipes from under the ground, hurling the Blob through the air. The force of impact from landing loosens the mental block in his mind, and his memory returns. Wanting revenge against the X-Men, the Blob agrees to join the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.\nAt the mansion, Cerebro's alarm suddenly goes off, alerting Cyclops to the Blob's recent activities.  Cyclops tries to contact the rest of the X-Men, successfully reaching Warren.  Warren gathers Hank and Bobby so they can meet back up with Scott and Jean.\nMagneto challenges the X-Men to a fight at an abandoned factory.  Cyclops' leadership skills quickly show, as he leads the X-Men in successful counter attacks to everything that the evil mutants throw at them, including missiles.  With the X-Men standing together, Magneto fires a second round of missiles at the group, even though the Blob is standing next to them.\nThe X-Men hide behind the bulky villain and let him take the full force of the missiles.  Magneto orders the rest of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to retreat, seeing that his plans have failed.  The X-Men offer to help the Blob, since his teammates abandoned him.  The Blob refuses, telling them that he's fed up with fighting other people's fights, and that he just wants to return to the carnival."

While tending to his cuts and scrapes, the bovine relates her story...and Quicksilver’s own.\nPietro’s rescuer is named Bova and she was the first of the new men created by the High Evolutionary who would become the Knights of Wundagore. Bova was created specifically to be a midwife, nursemaid, and nanny to any children in the citadel.\nOne winter night, a desperate and very pregnant woman came to the citadel seeking sanctuary. Her name was Magda and she was fleeing from her husband, a man who had acquired extraordinary powers but used them cruelly. Having grown afraid of him, she ran away shortly after she realized she was pregnant. Bova delivered Magda’s twin children, a boy and a girl (Pietro and Wanda). Bova recalls seeing peculiar lights in the sky on the night the twins were born. However, soon after the birth, Magda vanished. She left a note stating that if her husband ever found out about the twins, he would seek them out. Fearing his evil influence on her children, Magda instead chose to wander out into the storm and end her life rather than risk her husband discovering them.\nBova asked the High Evolutionary what they should do with the infants. They agreed that Wundagore was no place for normal human children, so he invited a traveling American couple, Bob and Madeleine Frank (who had formerly been the WWII-era superheroes the Whizzer and Miss America), to the citadel. Madeleine had already given birth to one mutant child (the Avenger’s former opponent Nuklo) and was pregnant again and feared the worst. The High Evolutionary intended to have Bova deliver Madeleine’s child and give them the twins as well. Alas, Madeleine’s labor was a disaster. Her horribly deformed child was stillborn and the mother died shortly afterward. Bova presented the twins to Bob Frank and attempted to pass them off as his own. But when he learned his wife was deceased, he fled from the citadel in grief (thus, this led to the Whizzer’s later mistaken belief that he was the twins’ father.)\nFinally, the High Evolutionary presented the twins to a Roma couple, Django Maximoff and his wife, members of a caravan in the foothills of the mountain. Django’s wife had recently lost twins of her own. The gift of the twins was seen as a kind of divine intervention, their children were being restored to them.\nAt the end of Bova’s recounting, Pietro realizes that Django is the man who raised him and Wanda. When he asks who his father is, Bova cannot tell him as she doesn’t know. Pietro is left with one unanswered question: Where is Wanda?\nFar up the mountainside, Wanda is magically bound by Modred atop the unholy altar as he intends to use her as a vessel to bring his dark master back to this world. She frees herself via a hex and a magical battle ensues. Wanda realizes she can’t fight Modred on this level and cedes the battle. Then she surprises him with a roundhouse left, knocking him off the cliff and down the mountain. But Modred has a surprise in store as well as he appears behind her and knocks her out with a bolt of mystical energy.\nJust as Quicksilver is saying goodbye to Bova, Wanda’s face appears as a sinister apparition in the night sky. The vision lashes out at Pietro and Bova with a lightning bolt although Pietro’s speed saves him and Bova. The Vision warns that he will die if he attempts to seek out Wanda. Quicksilver runs down the mountain and encounters Django in the woods. They are attacked by magically animated trees but escape. Braving a number of magical assaults, they return to the village where Quicksilver places a call to Avengers Mansion. The Vision answers the call.\nIn the mansion dining room, the rest of the active team is enjoying a meal together and discussing Iron-Man’s current dilemma (see Notes below). Captain America has temporarily taken over as a team leader in Iron Man’s absence. The Vision then bursts in and tells them of Pietro’s call. Just as they start getting ready to go, Gyrich refuses to allow them to go! He states that Pietro is not an active member of the team and there is no U.S. security interest, thus they don't need to “start another international incident.” Exasperated, Cap leaves the room to place a mysterious call. The Beast and Gyrich trade insults, then Gyrich gets a call from the U.S. President authorizing the Avengers mission! Cap smirks in the background. Once more, the team is about to leave, but Gyrich still has to throw his weight around -- he demands that the Vision remain behind! One active member must remain behind on monitor duty at all times and the Vision is in the middle of his shift. Fed up, the Vision is about to slug Gyrich when Cap intervenes. He promises to bring Wanda safe and sound. The Vision relents, though he’s extremely unhappy.\nBack in East Transia, Django and Quicksilver are ambushed by Wanda. Except it's not Wanda. She is possessed by the demon Chthon!"

The figurines are produced at a 1:21 scale, so that regular figurines have a height around 9 cm. Bigger figurines are also produced: bulky characters like the Hulk are considered as Specials while giant characters like Galactus are called Mega Specials. Double Packs consisting of two figurines of related characters have also been released. The collection have been released in various countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Greece, France, South Africa, Spain, Brazil, Poland and the USA. Confusingly not all areas have seen the characters released in the same order. All figurines also come with a magazine, with 21 pages in the first 100 issues and 16 in the latter 100. Most covers featured images reprinted from comics and trading cards, but towards the latter hundred original artworks began to be used. However, sometimes those covers were still in production by the time an issue had to be announced. This is why some of the issues with original covers have alternate \"preview\" covers."

Mojo pitches his \"pitch to end all pitches...Avengers of the Supernatural!\" However, the executives warn that should he fail them again, they'll release the Critics on him. Mojo then starts narrating:\nAt Avengers Mansion, Wasp and Rogue are gossiping by the pool when Havok does a cannonball to put an end to it. Out of annoyance, Wasp pushes Havok back into the pool when he climbs out.\nMeanwhile, Wonder Man accidentally interrupts Scarlet Witch's seven hours-long casting.\nDownstairs, Captain America and Sunfire are playing pool while Thor and Wolverine are getting drunk. Unfortunately, Thor gets too inebriated and mistakes Wolverine for a troll and slams his head against the ceiling. Suddenly, they detect the scent of brimstone, as Ghost Rider appears and attacks them. The Avengers are caught off guard as Ghost Rider slaps some sort of headband on Thor's forehead, causing him to vanish. As the Unity Squad tried to get their bearings, the rest of the Avengers of the Supernatural, Doctor Strange, Blade, Satana, Man-Thing and Manphibian join the party. One-by-one, the Unity Squad are subdued by Mojo's headbands, until only Cap, Wonder Man and Scarlet Witch are left standing. Scarlet Witch entraps Strange, noting that he's speaking as if from some poorly written script. Unfortunately, she doesn't get the chance to figure out what's going on, as Satana places headbands on her and Wonder Man. Cap is the last to go down and they are all teleported to Mojoworld.\nMojo then starts using the Avengers in his new series:Martian Transylvania Super Hero Mutant Monster Hunter High School. He places Cap, Wasp, Thor and Scarlet Witch as a popular kids group, while Havok, Rogue, Wolverine and Sunfire are another gang clad in black. Janet, cast as Thor's girlfriend, passes a glance at Alex Summers/Havok, prompting Thor to get angry.\nMojo is directing all this from behind the scenes with Wonder Man at his side. The Suits call him, demanding he make the show more interesting by turning Ghost Rider evil, forcing Wanda to kill him, the man she loves. Though Mojo is hesitant to go through with that too soon, the Suits threaten to replace him, forcing him to make it work.\nSo Wanda enters the Sanctum Sanctorum, seeking advice about her love for Johnny Blaze from the Antiquated Stereotype Geek Brigade, composed of Strange, Manphibian, Blade and Satana. Strange is appalled that she would fall for Blaze and warns her not to fall in love. Despondent and confused, Wanda runs out into the rain, where she runs into Blaze. He confesses his feelings for her, before Wanda reveals that she is pregnant.\nSuddenly, Blaze gets upset and turns into Ghost Rider, breaking character and starts racing off the set, breaking Mojo's control over his captives. Scarlet Witch attacks Mojo, berating him for tampering with Blaze's mind. For making the Spirit of Vengeance believe it had creating an offspring, he had shut down Johnny Blaze's influence. Without its human conscience, Ghost Rider will seek vengeance on all life, perceiving life to be a sin. The collective heroes and anti-heroes prepare to leave, but Mojo pleads them to stay and save Mojoworld, pointing out there are so many innocent slaves they are sworn to protect.\nGhost Rider soon unleashes his Penance Stare upon Mojoworld, causing everyone to feel the weight of their sins. Strange manages to shield his allies temporarily from the Penance Stare. He then turns to Satana for help, stating that they must exorcise the Spirit of Vengeance from Blaze, resetting the curse and temper the spirit. The heroes then attack Ghost Rider, but Thor's attack causes him to grow to gigantic size. Satana then attempts to exorcize him but is incapacitated before she could do so. Man-Thing attempts to consume Ghost Rider, but is swiftly destroyed from the inside. With no other options left, Scarlet Witch confronts Ghost Rider, acknowledging her fault in allowing her lie to set Ghost Rider wild. As Ghost Rider charges at her, Rogue grapples with him, using her powers to pull the curse into herself. Unfortunately, she cannot bear the burden and pleads Blaze to retake the curse. Though he considers being free of Ghost Rider, he cannot bear the sight of Rogue suffering, so he retakes the curse.\nThe heroes then return to Avengers Mansion, where Blaze sulks at being the bearer of the Ghost Rider again. Wasp interrupts his diatribe by pushing him into the pool. The Unity Squad then all jump into the pool.\n• The first appearance of the Avengers of the Supernatural!\n• When the producers of the Mojoverse can’t make a hit series they call on Mojo to gather an all-new, all-creepy Avengers!"

In the past, he has desecrated the Avengers' image by making them out to be rogue outlaws, by importing false facts in the Avengers museum. However, Thor, the last original Avenger alive, revealed the truth about the lies Kang made up about them and led a group of rebels against the conqueror.[1]\nAt some point, under unknown circumstances,Hulkbecame aware of Kang's existence.[2]\nA portal from a thousand years into the past opens within his armory, where some of his equipment was stolen byA.I.M.Kang then metIron Manwho travelled through the portal and was accidentally brought to the past with him where he met the Avengers \"before the schism\". Kang then attempted to conquer the world of the past, taking over the present A.I.M. operatives and later brought his ship theSword of Damocles, which he planned to use to destroy the isle of Manhattan. However, his plans were soon stopped by the Avengers, at the last minute Kang flies through a portal back to his time while also bringing most of the Avengers on board his ship with him.[3]\nKang later appeared at the Avengers tower of his time to find the Avengers of the past and the rebels led by Thor and sends his robot army to eliminate them. Kang used the advancedArc Reactorto power his Portal Generator to give himself access to all possible worlds to conquer. Just when he opened a portal,Captain Americainterfered which led to the both of them to be taken into the portal, as the two struggled for the portal generator, they were accidentally transported back in time during World War II. Kang continued to fight Captain America as they argued over each others' ideals while in the middle of a war zone. Cap then sent the both of them further back into the prehistoric times when they were faced with a dinosaur. After escaping from it, the two faced each other off in a fist fight with Cap having the advantage. Kang attempted to leave him behind at that time period but was unable to when Captain America got to the Portal Generator and left him behind instead.[3]\nKang was able to travel back to the modern time and was a member of the newCaballed by the Leader who were stealing components to forever be rid of the Avengers. They were able to trap them, butBlack Pantherwas able to take back theVibraniumfrom the machine that would rid the Avengers, howeverAmora the Enchantresswas later able to retrieve. Just before they were able to use their machine, the Cabal then faced the New Avengers team who came to save the original team. They were too late as the Cabal betrayed the Leader, escaped, and disperse the Avengers across time and space.[4]\nKang in particular, sentFalcona few decades into the future to a mostly deserted New York that he ruled using tech dampeners to block any technology aside from his. There he needed his help in saving the world from a rip in the universe caused by Kang's constant time travel. Falcon reluctantly agreeed to join him in exchange of letting the people of New York free, return to his time, and never time travel again. For the next few years, Kang trained him in different forms of combat as he defended Kang from others such asRed Hulkwho did not trust the conqueror's way doing things.\nHours before the singularity swallowed Earth, Falcon broughtVisionto Kang's castle when he andWaspcame looking for him, Falcon persuaded Kang that they can use Vision's computing power to help them. The three of them were the interrupted by Wasp and Red Hulk who destroyed most of Kang's technology, but Vision explained to them the truth before any permanent damage resulted, together they managed to cage the black hole thus sealing its energy just in time. However, Kang revealed his true intentions to use its energy to time travel without the negative side effects. He asked Falcon to join him but refused to which he also revealed that he installed tech dampeners to keep him from using it. Kang battled the four of them until it was just him and his former pupil, as they fought Falcon was able to beat him in combat and blasted his face with his own weapon, while defeated Kang told them the true power of the Cabal was coming and that \"he'lltake care of things\" but was interrupted when Red Hulk kicked him across far away. Kang was then later imprisoned.[5]"

Meanwhile,Ultron Pymfinishes taking downWar Machineand sets out to kill Tony Stark. Before Ultron arrives,Machine Manreunites withJocasta, having attached himself to salvaged parts of Ultron's cyborgs to mend his damaged body.\nUltron arrives and takes down Tony's remaining allies, ravaging Jocasta's provisional body. Iron Man confronts the villain, and uses a portable version ofDr. Shapiro's atomic separator on two of his brute cyborgs, proving to Ultron that his fusion process kills the human side as soon as it's merged with machinery, meaning his cyborgs are effectively zombies and not the harmonic union of flesh and machine he believed they were. Machine Man confirms the assertion, being wired to parts of Ultron's cyborgs. Ultron points out it worked on Stark, but Tony reveals that his microscopic venture into his own body confirmed that he is an artificial being, reason why the fusion didn't kill him. Iron Man manages to make Ultron surrender after threatening to use the atomic separator on him, on the prospect it would prove that the realHank Pymdied the moment he was merged with Ultron, and the villain has only been neurotically simulating to be merged with his creator. TheAvengersarrive and secure Ultron in a magically-reinforcedVibraniumcasket until they find a permanent prison.\nIn light of Tony's confirmation and acknowledgement that he is only a copy of the real, late Tony Stark,Arno Starkseizes control ofStark Unlimitedsince Tony's body had been manufactured in the bio-restructuring pods of his design. Arno keeps Jocasta's body from her friends, and firesBethany Cabe. He andSunset Baintry to take claim of theWar Machine Armor, but Rhodey refuses. With all of Stark Unlimited's resources at his disposal, Arno sets out to recreate theGodbuster Armor, declaring that it will be the Iron Man of 2020.\nOn New Year's Eve, Machine Man incites a revolution to fight for robot's rights and fight the increasing discrimination they face. Bereft, Tony spends the night at a bar and decides to start drinking for real. Near midnight, Arno refuses to spend the night with his returned parents, claiming he has no time to waste since his entire life has led to this year in which he will save all life onEarth. Arno takes his newarmoron a flight and unveils it to the public inTimes Squarejust as the New Year's countdown reaches its end, marking the start of 2020.\nClad in hisClassic Armor,Iron Manflies pastStark Unlimitedemployees to urge them to leave due toUltron Pym's imminent arrival, and tellsBethany CabeandJarvisto help the evacuation. Tony asksAndy BhangandDr. Shapiroto follow him, and leaves theWaspandJocastato hold the fort.\nIn the streets, Ultron monologues that he has been robbed of everything, with his first wave of brute cyborgs being neutralized and Tony having found a way to reverse the process. He proclaims all he has left is human revenge. Behind him layVisionandWonder Manunconscious whileWar Machinestands hunched forward, and challenges Ultron. The villain mocks Rhodey and has two of cyborgs shield him, arguing that since there is a cure for their condition, Jim can't kill them, and he can't fire around them either since his targeting systems are damaged. Ultron states the opposite is truth for him, and blasts Rhodey away with an energy ray. He turns towards theStark Unlimited HQand announces the end of Tony Stark.\nBack in S.U., Jocasta and the Wasp are approached by a silhouette that turns out to beMachine Man, having scavenged limbs from Ultron's wrecked cyborgs to mend his damaged body. Jocasta points out Aaron has recognized her despite occupyingFriday's body. He explains he'd recognize her no mater the chassis since her programming is what matters. Jocasta laments her bond with Ultron and her wish to become part organic inspired the villain, and Aaron consoles her.\nInside a lab, Iron Man is working to make a portable version of the device used to reverse Ultron's molecular fusion, which amazes Andy. Tony apologizes to Bhang for bringing him toStark Unlimitedsince it has endangered his life, but Andy assures him it was his choice, and tells him that this job has allowed him to do things most scientist only dream of and save lives. Andy elaborates that Tony got him out of his personal \"cave\" and because of his experiences he has never been more alive, and thanks him. Meanwhile at theBaintronics Headquarters,Arno Stark,Sunset Bain, and the duplicates ofHowardandMaria Starkare watching a live feed of the laboratory, made possible by Arno hacking S.U.'s security cameras.\nUltron Pym blasts into Stark Unlimited's upper lobby calling for Tony. Accusing Jocasta and Janet of choosing Tony over him, Ultron discharges an energy blasts knocking them and Machine Man unconscious, ravaging Jocasta's provisional body, and states he will kill them together. Iron Man suddenly flies into Ultron and punches him. Reeling from the attack, Ultron sneers at Tony over his choice of an outdated armor, and blasts him away while Tony reciprocates. Two cyborgs restrain Iron Man and Ultron mocks his lack of strength, but Tony reveals he allowed himself to be captured on purpose, and orders Andy and Shapiro to fire. Two rays of energy hit Ultron's minions, fired from the portable device in Andy Bhang's hands. The machinery falls off the cyborgs, reverting them to human corpses. Ultron accuses Tony of being a monster willing to undo the fusion even if it kills the beings involved, but Iron Man retorts that the people died by Ultron's hand the second he made them into cyborgs. Ultron denies the fact in shock. Lying in the ground, Machine Man confirms Tony's assertion. He explains he is wired into parts of Ultron's cyborgs, and confirms that the procedure murdered both the robotic and human side, effectively turning them into zombies. Ultron brings up Vision and Wonder Man's fusion, but Machine Man states it was a fluke due to Vision's phasing powers and Wonder Man's actual biological parts having died and having been reconstituted years ago. The villain contends that it worked on Stark, but Tony tells him he learned something when he got a microscopic view of his own body. He reveals that he is a simulation too, that the real Tony Stark never came back, and that he is an artificial being himself. Tony's parents observe this revelation from the camera feed in shock, while Sunset wonders if they are recording it. Arno quickly tells his parents to go away.\nTony tells Ultron that he has finally accepted his nature, and threatens to have Andy use the atomic separator on him in order to confirm that he is not the perfect fusion he claims to be, sinceHank Pymwould be long way gone. Ultron accuses Tony of bluffing and argues he would be left with a rampaging Ultron unrestrained by human emotions. Tony states he is willing to take the chance, and asks Ultron if he is as well. Calling Ultron's godlike statues a neurotic fantasy, Tony starts to count from three. Ultron kneels and proclaims surrender. The scene settles down, and Machine Man attends to Jocasta's unconscious and badly damaged body, asking Tony if they can fix her. Iron Man tells him they will as soon as Ultron is secure. After Andy wonders how are they going to do that, Jarvis and Bethany arrive to announce that help is on the way, and Jarvis exclaims \"Avengers Assemble.\"\nSome time later, theAvengershave arrived and Ultron has been placed within a casket.Black Panthermentions it's aVibraniumcell andThorexplains it's reinforced with mysticAsgardiansrunes and bindings, meant to keep Ultron secure until they can find a permanent prison.Captain Marvelchecks up on War Machine, and Rhodey shares with her that despite being tragic, he finds it reassuring that Ultron's cyborgs were already dead. Carol approaches Tony, who is sitting in the rubble looking down. Asking him if he's fine, Tony thinks to himself that he is only a copy, and that the real Tony Stark has been dead since she killed him. He turns his gaze to her, still saddened, and tells her that he is fine. All of Tony's allies leave save for the Wasp, and she tries to get Tony to open up. He reiterates that he is only a copy, rejects his state of being real, and tells Janet that he deserves somebody real. Wasp consoles Tony and kisses him, but he keeps his eyes down, and flies away apologizing.\nIn the days and weeks that follow,Senator Miles Brickmanrejoices as he is on a video call with Tony. Stark acknowledges that he is an artificial life-form and takes responsibility for the crises at Stark Unlimited, claiming they should not reflect the people of the company or the late, real Tony Stark. Senator Brickman turns to Arno and Sunset, who are present in his office. Concurring on the success of the course of action, Arno reassures Brickman when the Senator asks him if he is ready to proceed. Arno appears next on TV, publicly confirming that Tony is an artificial being created by theMaria Stark Foundationbio-restructuring pods he designed, making Tony property of his foundation, and by extension everything he invented, including his company and everything it in. Moving the scene to Stark Unlimited, Tony's close allies protest being denied access to Jocasta by Arno and Sunset. Bethany objects merging S.U. with Baintronics, arguing that Bain has broken into their systems countless times. Arno and Bain use that fact against Bethany, and fire her arguing the security is awful. At theHall of Armor, Arno and Sunset speak with Rhodey through video call to claim ownership of theWar Machine Armor. Rhodey tells them to take the matter to thePentagonand hangs up. Arno brushes it off, telling Sunset he is not concerned with the old suits, and wants instead to pour all resources into recreating theGodbuster Armor, declaring that it will be the Iron Man of 2020.\nAt theUncanny Valley, the robot patrons are discussing their continuous denial of rights. Machine Man storms into the bar and stands on the counter, warning his brethren that the laws being passed will lead to oppression and enslavement. He urges the robots to rise up and calls for the robot revolution. The patrons support him and begin to chant \"Reboot the system!\"\nSomewhere else inManhattanat a regular bar, the patrons are celebrating New Year's Eve. Tony sits in a corner of the counter and asks for a scotch. The bartender asks him for an I.D. and Tony sardonically replies that he's technically eighteen months old. After the bartender wishes Tony a happy last drink of the year while pouring the order, Tony vaguely explains him that it's going to be his first drink ever, and looks at his reflection in the glass, wondering what is going to be the harm.\nAt Arno's living quarters, Howard and Maria are dressed up with champagne in hand in anticipation for midnight. They invite Arno to join him, but he dismisses them, telling them that he can't waste a moment of the new year since his entire life has been leading to this, which he calls his destiny. Arno flies away in an armor, announcing that it will be the year he saves all life onEarthand nothing will stand in his way. InTimes Square, the celebrating bystanders start counting down from ten. As the countdown ends, Arno reaches the scene hovering above the crowd, unveiling his ownIron Man Armor, accompanied by the New Year cheers.\nTHE ULTRON AGENDA FINALE!"

Arno was basically untouchable, as Tony promised Howard to allow Arno free market in the city as long as he didn't break any laws. Even though Arno constantly opposed Tony, and even provided technology for criminals, Tony had not been able to prove his brother's illicit activities, and opposed the idea to use his power as Baron to get rid of Arno. Among the people Arno had business with was theKingpinof crime.[1]\nAfter Tony tried to acquireKiri Oshiro's Mobairu Yōsai Mechaniks, Arno sent a spy to infiltrate Kiri's building in hopes to find the technological advancements she was working on, that could allow him to have the upper hand against his brother.[2]After discovering Arno's attempt on Kiri, Tony confronted him in his headquarters. While Tony blasted Arno out of his building, the two brothers engaged in a civil and friendly conversation.[3]Tony reassured that it was important for Kiri to stay alive, as her technology could be relevant to keeping Howard's secret.[4]\nTony and Arno made a temporary alliance after theThorof Technopolis and Grand MarshalJim Rhodesstarted investigating Spyder-Man's murder and discovered the truth. While Arno kept theWar Machine Deputiesneutralized, Tony killed Rhodes. However, the truth still got out because Rhodes had been transmitting his confrontation with Tony to his nieceLila, who was friends with Kiri. Kiri and Lila decided to stop the Stark brothers once and for all, and deployed two giant mechas to confront them.[5]"

After coming back from the eScape, Tony hijacked the bleeding edge 3D printers in possession ofBaintronicsto construct the Godbuster Armor in real life, with the limitations of his human body already causing the intricacies of the design to fade from his memory. Once finished, Iron Man used the Godbuster Armor to effortlessly stop the villain and knock him out.

The \"priest\" revealed himself to be the Hood before the Punisher was enraged and attempted to kill him before breaking down a door and finding himself in his family home. He was surprised to see that Maria and his children were all alive and grown up.\nAfter kissing Maria and hugging his children, Lisa wanted to introduce him to \"someone special\" and it was the Hood. The Punisher pinned the Hood to a wall and told him not to touch his daughter, although the Hood claimed that he couldn't \"until he allowed him to bring them back.\" When the Punisher turned around, they were \"all dead as doornails\" and he threw the Hood through a door before the two were surrounded by dead bodies. The Hood told him that without the love of his family to his desire to kill, his future was only the dead bodies around them.\nHenry woke Frank up inside of a trailer of a truck full of computers and told him about a shipment of drugs coming in. Frank told him to find a target with a bloody history although Henry insisted that he didn't kill anybody. Then, Frank responded by pinning him against a wall before Henry shoved him away before he was told to \"pack up and go\" if he didn't like how \"his business\" was done. After the Punisher left, Henry angrily smashed one of his screens with his chair and thought that if he ever laid a hand on him again, it would be the last time.\nMeanwhile, Megatak was helping Microchip locate the Punisher and find out who his hacker was and Mirage argued with Letha and Titania, both who were given new powers by the Hood, before the latter of the two women used her new power to induce desire in him. Mind-Wave threatened Letha before she caused Cyclone to attack him with her new power of aggression inducement. Then, Letha told the rest that it was time to \"step it up\", that the Punisher and every other vigilante in New York would be dead, and that the city would be theirs. At the Bar With No Name, Basilisk and Death Adder chained G.W. Bridge and successfully convinced him to agree to capture the Punisher alive for them after threatening Tyler.\nThe Punisher shot and killed the Wraith with a bow and arrow when he was alone at night before Henry gave him Bird-Man's location. Nearby, the Human Fly was eating a woman named Tina before a Black Stream squad confronted him, only to be killed.

At the Bar With No Name, Basilisk and Death Adder planned to use Bridge's distress signal to lure the Punisher while he was attempting to cut himself free from his chains.\nMeanwhile, the Punisher snapped \"Beast's\" neck, shot \"Iron Man\", and knocked \"Captain America\" into a wall, killing the first, injuring the other two, and learning that they were not really the Avengers and actually Cheetah, Mind-Wave, and Mirage. Due to Mirage being defeated, the others were also exposed and Letha, Lascivious, and Black Abbott learned from a mortally wounded Mind-Wave that the Punisher took Mirage. Letha argued with Miracle Man before they and Letha were all caught in one of the Punisher's bombs while Henry told him that a S.H.I.E.L.D. distress signal coming from the Bar With No Name was sent to his satellite. The Punisher knew that Bridge was being used for bait and Henry told him that he was badly beaten and that Tyler was there too. Before leaving for the Bar With No Name, the Punisher put something in Mirage's mouth. Norman contacted the Hood and confronted him about his gang being conspicuous, but said that he would keep the law away.\nAfter the Human Fly came to Letha and Lascivious, Mirage came back to them with his hands tied and something in his mouth. After Letha took it out, it exploded, as it was another bomb, although she and the others survived and planned to get the Punisher with Lascivious and the Human Fly. From Mirage, the Punisher learned that the Hood brought him and others back to life and while he was telling Henry about it, the Human Fly attacked him before Letha and Lascivious joined him.

At the same time, X-Force infiltrates Akkaba City while Famine get free by simply tapping his fingers, causing pain towards E.V.A. X-Force then split up; Deathlok goes to destroy the World while Fantomex and Deadpool go after Archangel. As they make their way through the city, Deadpool states that he still doesn't understand what's going on. Fantomex explains to him that Archangel plans to destroy all life on the planet before using the World and Life Seed to create new life and be worshiped as a god, like what he did at the Tabula Rasa environment. Suddenly, they are ambushed by AoA Blob and only Deadpool is left standing to fight him. Before Blob could devour him, Deadpool stabs his sword into Blob's tongue. Up above, Famine readies his drums, only for a recovered Wolverine to get the drop on him. Instead of killing him, he relieves Famine of his hands. Fantomex manages to crawl out from under Blob and dives into the water to cleanse himself of the stench.\nMeanwhile, Archangel takes Psylocke out of prison, who still tries getting through to the man she loves inside to no avail. Archangel smugly tells her that in participating in X-Force, each kill brought him a step closer to dominating Warren Worthington. As he shows her the World, Genocide's mother confronts him, accusing him of turning her son into a monster. In response, Archangel bisects her, declaring that Genocide is serving evolution. This horrifies Psylocke, who compares him to Apocalypse.\nAs Fantomex gets out of the water, he is attacked by a giant AoA Iceman. Deadpool takes notice and leaps to attack. But this is a pointless attack, as Iceman conjures up more avatars. Iceman then freezes Deadpool and shatters him to pieces, to Fantomex's horror. Fantomex then runs for his life and reunites with E.V.A.\nWolverine get into psychic contact with Psylocke, who updates him on what's happening. He then orders her to put Archangel down. Psylocke then grabs a hidden gun and takes a shot, only to miss. This pleases Archangel as he declares her to be the bride he has been waiting for.

He remains confident that no one can stop them. The page then shows an image of Ultimaton guarding the incubating En Sabah Nur, age 4832 days. Deathlok confronts Dark Beast, only to be attacked by War, who places the cyborg under his thrall. Dark Beast then instructs Genocide to begin.\nArchangel places Psylocke on a pedestal, rolled over and plunges the Death Seed into her spine, declaring that she shall be his Queen and Horseman of Death."

Suddenly, their prey is ushered in by the hunchback Jarvis, and offers them a deal: the Orb of Necromancy in exchange for safe passage home. Gloating, Brother Voodoo reaches for the Orb... realizing too late that it was a setup. Captain Britain activates the Orb as they are both holding it, turning Brother Voodoo into a flesh-and-blood human. With this distraction, the Avengers are able to use their magic against his will, and depart. The Avengers of the Undead swear vengeance.\nReturning to their home reality, the trio are shocked to discover the Descendants' revolution has already begun. By chance, they gain the help of Spider-Man, but the argument of how to stop the robots hits a speedbump when Beast kills one of the robots and it dies like a human. Captain Britain, however, is already away: his parents were killed by a sentient computer his father buit, and he vows to stop this event before it becomes his family's legacy - but he is shot down by the android Human Torch, who has joined the Descendants.\nOn the rooftop, Spider-Man, Beast and Hawkeye are discussing the effects of activating the Orb of Necromancy, but are ambushed by Deathlok Wasp and Deathlok Giant-Man. Their cyber-chauvinism is amusing to Father, who informs the duo over the radio that they only need to hold the humans off a bit longer, and they have won.\nIn the Core, another Secret Avengers team breaks into the nursery of Parvez, who was kidnapped from the heroes by a Descendant strikeforce. As they prepare to escape with him, the group is ambushed by the Black Ant, an LMD of Ant-Man who infiltrated the team. Black Ant explains that he remembers every part of Ant-Man's life, and that if he did not do as Father said, Father would have killed him. Black Ant's justificiations cause Venom to go berserk, and a fight begins.\nAbove New York, Captain Britain fights Human Torch.\nBack on the roof, Beast reveals his secret to Deathlok Giant-Man: ever since he heard Giant-Man was going to be on the team, he began preparng for a robot invasion. He demonstrates this by scrambling the Deathlok circuitry wih an anti-personnel EMP syringe. Giant-Man recovers, and in the shock, Deathlok Wasp escapes with the Orb of Necromancy.\nGiant-Man tells them what he knows: if they use the Orb, they can kill the Descendants. But if they strike after the virus has run its course, then they will kill everyone on Earth. Enraged by how he was used, Giant-Man grow to colossal size and punches a Sentinel.\nIt is a battle on many fronts. For instance, in the Core, Black Ant just shot Venom in the head...\n• In The Core Venom and Valkyrie set out on a mission to kill Father.\n• In New York The Master Mold rises and the only way to stop him is to kill The Torch!"

Father welcomes Yalda, and tells her they are going to change the world together.\nFather proceeds to tell Yalda that she is the next stage of evolution,Homo synthezoidus- a “marriage” of nature and science. Father shares that his goal is to help all of humanity join a “communal universal consciousness”, and that he’ll teach Yalda and her son,Parvez, to harness their powers once they join the consciousness themselves.

Nuke believes foreigners make Americans look bad; but Captain America, as the son of immigrants, replies all nations and religions want the same thing: peace, the reason good men become soldiers. They fight for a peaceful world.\nJust as Nuke comes to his senses, he sees a reporter nearby. Enraged, Nuke chases after her, berating the press for making American soldiers look bad. Fortunately, Falcon sweeps in and tackles Nuke, giving the journalist enough time to escape. But Nuke brutally beats Falcon down and corners the journalist near a cliff. As Nuke is about to stab her with a combat knife, Falcon saves her and Captain America catches up to Nuke and continues the attack.\nFalcon drops the reporter off at a nearby road but asks for her camera. The journalist claims to be an American standing by freedom of press. She denounces S.H.I.E.L.D. as a clandestine group operating above the law, but Falcon is only interested in saving lives. The journalist offers her camera to Falcon, asking him if he believes in freedom of the press as fundamental right or only out of convenience. Falcon refuses to take the camera and leaves, telling the journalist an envoy will pick her up soon.\nNuke attacks with more anger than ever but Captain America slowly turns the tables on his opponent and brutally beats him down. As S.H.I.E.L.D. forces arrive and take Nuke into custody, Nick informs Captain America and Falcon a reporter has published an article that depicts Captain America and Nuke authorizing a genocidal attack in Nrosvekistan. It was the same reporter Falcon saved earlier from Nuke. When Captain America asks Falcon if he took her camera, Falcon only stays silent.\nMeanwhile in China, the Iron Nail watches the news about Nrovekistan. Although the Iron Nail does not enjoy using the Americans' freedom of the press against them, he will continue his mission to free the world from American capitalism. His next step will be to attack S.H.I.E.L.D.'s heart.\nLOOSE NUKE PART 4\n• Falcon and Captain America in the fight of their lives!\n• The Iron Nail’s revenge takes form.\n• No more greed.

Evan Sabahnur stands over him in a modified Apocalypse costume, and casually informs him that this could end no other way.\nRight now, X-Force is returning from their detour to the future. They are greeted by Deathlok Prime, that future's lone rebel, who has two pieces of information for them. The first is that he is about to depart to hunt down Ultimaton and destroy the miniaturized World complex he carries. The second is that the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants has kidnapped Evan and taken him to Genosha. They will torture him and force him down a course that leads him to become the new Apocalypse. Deathlok's warning is to the team: their actions over the next day will determine the fate of the world.\nIn the Brotherhood's secret base, Sabretooth and Mystique are in bed together. Sabretooth thinks that X-Force is dead, but that Wolverine is still alive. he knows that Wolverine's response to the loss of the team and the boy will be a berserker rage and an unthinking state of murder. Evan will kill him, cementing his position as the new Apocalypse and as their new meal ticket. Then Sabretooth & Mystique can take control of the Brotherhood. The couple gets excited just thinking about it.\nFlying to the infiltration point, X-Force gets a video-call from Beast at the Jean Grey School: Beast, telling them that Evan has been kidnapped. Wolverine has been off-grid for hours, and Beast is getting angry. He accepts that X-Force will do what they can, but Beast is clear: if Evan dies, the survivors will have to deal with him.\nAt the base, Evan is still reeling from the revelation that his parents aren't real. Fantomex rushes forward with his face covered, and Evan gets up to greet him, but reacts in horror when it is revealed to be Fantomex's corpse puppeteered by the Skinless Man. Daken gets to the point, pointing out that if Evan wants to direct his anger, he can put on the Apocalypse Suit. It will boost his powers and shield his mind, protecting him from both the torture of the Brotherhood and the lies of X-Force. They leave the suit and the corpse and say they will let him make his own choice.\nOutside the room, Daken admits to Sabretooth that Evan has a lot of inner strength, but Sabretooth returns to the reason for the plan: showing Wolverine how much of a hypocrite he is. By assembling the group they have, they have a group of killers to fight a group of killers. By corrupting Evan, they can point out the hypocrisy of working at the school while abandoning his own son. Sabretooth tells Daken he deserves a father who loves him. As they enter the control room, they discover the Farouk is using his mental powers to enhance the Omega Clan's hatred of X-Force.\nIn her room, Mystique is washing up, consider who she shall kill to get control, when she is approached by Sabretooth, asking for an urgent talk in a secluded area. Going with him, she walks into an ambush, when \"Sabretooth\" puts in a psychic sleeper hold. The group argue about whether to resort to lethal force with Evan & Daken, with Psylocke saying no, Nightcrawler saying yes, and Eva and Wolverine opting for pragmatism. They ask for Deadpool's opinion, but he has vanished.\nIn the base, Evan is considering the Apocalypse Suit. Deadpool appears behind him and says he is ready to kill him now.\n• The Final Exectution kicks into high gear"

She admits that he was right about everything he did to Fantomex but he comforts her, telling her that Fantomex was created with three brains, one of which was a mutant hunting sentinel, and says that the fact that he was able to fight the conflicting voices in his head is a testament to his character and adds that he loves his sister. Psylocke asks him to store the Shadow King and the Apocalypse armour Evan wore in Otherworld.\nMeanwhile, in the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, Evan is reading a book about meditation he received from Wolverine when Deadpool breaks into his room. Evan questions if it's wise to sneak up on an Apocalypse, and Deadpool tells him never to refers to himself as \"an Apocalypse\", telling him he's nothing like him. Evan tells him that he has the same capacity for evil as Apocalypse and that he would have killed Mystique unless Nightcrawler had rescued her. Deadpool responds that everyone has the capacity to be people with bad tempers, but the difference is that Evan never stopped fighting, just like Fantomex taught him. Evan says that his entire life was a lie, but Deadpool responds that no one really remembers their childhood, but what they learn is built into their fiber and that no matter if it was real or illusion, Fantomex raised him right. He adds that he'll always be there for Evan when he needs him. Evan thanks him by calling him a hero, something Deadpool claims to never have been called and he decides to leave before he spoils the mood with a fart joke, taking with him Evan's meditation book, claiming that meditation is for hippies or psychopaths trying to be hippies, and that Evan would get more use out of some \"Playguy\"-magazines he left him.\nPsylocke enters her apartment to find Wolverine waiting for her, telling her that there is one complication left unsolved with X-Force. The two leave for the hideout in E.V.A. and Psylocke asks him what the future Logan whispered to him before they left the future. The future Logan told him that he couldn't kill his own son and let Daken live, which led to Daken killing all of the students, telling the younger Wolverine that he knows what needs to be done. Wolverine doesn't respond to Psylocke's question however. They arrive at the hideout and find Deadpool there, and Fantomex emerging from a cloning machine. Two more Fantomexes appear however, one of them evil who teleports away and the other a woman. E.V.A. tells Fantomex that when they found his body, all three of his brains were still intact and she placed him in a cloning hatch to create a new body for him. The machine misunderstood however, and created a new body for each of Fantomexes brains. Deadpool tells him that he missed him, and Fantomex says he missed Deadpool too. Fantomex asks where they're off to now, but after being met by somber looks, he deduces that the team is done.

He saw it many times, that story of an artificial being who ultimately found acceptance by the humans by becoming one of them. Today, it has powered a political awakening, which will see Hammond lead the people of the Core as they bring about the Singularity. No-one can stop them.\nOn a nightmarish parallel Earth, Hawkeye, Beast and Captain Britain have gone looking for a vital artifact, but run into the local version of the Avengers. Fighting them off, our heroes escape, and Captain Britain explains: the artifact is Merlin's Orb of Necromancy, stolen from Otherworld by Cap's father or the final stages of the Descendants' creation. It is the ultimate source of the \"spark\" of life that powers all Descendants today. Captain Britain thinks they can use it to kill all their opponents, but Hawkeye plans to use it only as a threat. Beast is skeptical of this tactic, but Hawkeye points out that if it was one of the many sapient AIs they have met, they would say the same as him. Beast protests they cannot even get home, but Cap says he has a plan.\nIn the Core, Venom, Valkyrie and Black Widow are breaking into Father's base, hoping to find something they can use. However, the only member of Father's army they encounter is a hidden Black Ant, who radios the others.\nIn New York, Father learns the call and gets down to his real mission: explaining his plan to the collected UN. He explains that he represents the next step in intelligent life on this planet, true cybernetic post-humanism. Humans have given the Descendants and their allies grief and racism in the past, but they are a community, with families and lives. More, the human civilization is so dependant on technology that they have already won. Father explains that Descendants live everywhere in human civilization, breeding with humans. He then introduces Parvez, a naturally-occuring Descendant, born of an android mother and a human father. His birth heralds the natural rise of the robots; Father is simply accelerating the process, using his nanotechnology to give all humans bodies like his.\nAt this, a man in the first row accuses him of being a super-villain, but Father dismisses this as the eternal complaint of the losers in a revolution. He calls upon his children to rise and spread the Descendant gospel.\nAt this, a man in the second row splits open, flooding the chamber with Father's nanotechnology. Around the world, humans, from unassuming New Yorkers to the Winter Guard of Russia, reveal themselves as Descendant sleepers. Around New York, heroes hear the news - and around New York, they encounter rebel robots, fighting for their future. Surveying this, Father says that his future has arrived.\n• Contagious Robotic Evolution is go and the remaining Secret Avengers are the only ones left! But how do you stop a plague that has already begun to spread?\n• Torch, Venom and Valkyrie infiltrate the rebel robot base In The Core, but are Lord UltraVision and Monarch Machine Man friend or foe?"

Ant-Man makes many pop culture reference, which causes an annoyed Mr. X to put his knife to his throat and threatened to cut out his tongue. Iron Fist then sits down, causing the Thudnerbolts, except Ant-Man to leave, downright because they don't trust him, even if he's brainwashed.\nHarlem, the next day, Cage is having breakfast at a waffle diner. Then suddenly, his iPod beats, which he presumes to be call from his wife, when actually it is Ant-Man calling, hiding in his waffles, demanding that he cooperates. Cage doesn't take him seriously, until Paladin points a gun to his head and shoots. However, instead of going unconscious as expected, Cage gets up and punches Paladin right out of the diner. Mr. X and Scourge then descend on him. Cage takes out the former, as the bullet scrambled his brain, thus making his thoughts unreadable, before slamming a car on Scourge. Then, Iron Fist turns up, using a chi-enhanced punch to knock him out.\nWhen the Thunderbolts return to the Cube to report the success of their mission, Osborn has Iron Fist help Ghost in brainwashing Cage, so that he could fully use Power Man for his own purposes as promised. Ghost asks what happened after he helped Cage save his daughter, but after noticing a file saying, Project Luke Cage, he drops the subject.\nCage, strapped to a chair with adamantium restraints, threatens to make them pay for what they did to his friend. Paladin blocks the camera, deciding to take his time with the prisoner. Then suddenly, Cage's restraints snap off. He takes advantage of this by slamming Paladin to the ground and escaping into the air vents. Mr. X follows, only to run into the three pumpkin bomb Cage grabbed off Paladin, causing an explosion in the vent. Ghost reports this to Osborn, who presumes that Ant-Man, still inside Cage's body, must have done so and orders the Thunderbolts to kill them both or he'll kill them.\nCage makes it into the kitchen, Ant-Man calls him to send him to a vent to escape to freedom. As he runs down a corridor, small flying disk come at this. One of them manages to scan him, activating a laser grid. Scourge comes out of the shadows, explaining that these lasers are DNA-specific, which would even slice through his unbreakable skin. Disappointed that Cage didn't fulfill his deal with Osborn, he then fires at Cage's chest, causing him to fall back. Cage responds by throwing a disk at him, causing the lasers to reset to Scourge. He then runs from Headsman, ending up in a large pipe filled with rats and a combat-ready Iron Fist standing there. He tries to convince his friend to remember who he is, going far to remind him that he knows about Misty Knight being pregnant. Iron Fist angrily punches him across the face. By the time the other Thunderbolts arrive, Iron Fist is standing over an unconscious Cage. Headsman checks Cage's face up close, only to notice a dead rat by him. Then suddenly, Cage gets up and punches him into the side of the pipe. Apparently, Iron Fist's focused chi was able to cleanse his mind of the brainwashing. Together, the former Heroes for Hire fight against Mister X, using banter to distract him from realizing if he can read two different minds at once. Headsman then makes a comeback, using his anti-grav to slam into Cage. Before he could vertically slice his head,, Iron Fist kicks him of the anti-grav. They then follow the fleeing Ghost, hoping to find Osborn. However, teleportation equipment sends them away.\nLater, Osborn reprimands the Thunderbolts for letting the Heroes for Hire get away by deducting a huge amount from their next pay stub. He brings out a file full of falsified documents to lure out any traitors who aided in the Heroes' escape. When no one answers, he leaves. Only Ghost and Paladin remain at the table, where the former reveals to Paladin that Osborn was intending to have them replaced. Paladin was a little ticked off that Ghost didn't tell him that he was setting Cage free; Ghost tells him that he couldn't risk anything--they needed to make the hero program look like a disaster so that Osborn wouldn't salvage it.\nBack in Harlem, the Heroes are sitting down for dinner. Cage just came back from the restroom, relaying to Danny he thought he heard a scream coming from his butt. They then talk about trying to find out where the Thunderbolts' base is, so that they can gather their team to take it down. They know that one of the Thunderbolts teleported them out, so therefore, they have an advantage against Osborn. All the while, Ant-Man stealthy — and stinkily — sneaks away.\nhttp://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13107"

After many failures, the three lead scientists -Mother,Father, andBrother- used the magic of theOrb of Necromancyto instill true life into a group of twenty “high-breed” androids, creating human-synthezoid hybrids. The scientists disagreed on how to proceed with this discovery; Brother stole away with the Orb and Mother decided to release the high-breeds to allow them a chance at normal life.

However, Jean breaks it off, spotting a Sentinel breaking into Atlantis. She quickly dispatches it with her Phoenix powers. Through this small victory, it is apparent that more Sentinels will follow.\nNightcrawler is willing to point fingers at Wolverine, for their bit of peace was washed away when X-Force arrived. Jean reassures him that Wolverine is no snitch and that there is no time for an internal strife. A meeting is convened with the AoA X-Men and X-Force. With the help of a docile M.O.D.O.K. that was ineffectively cloned from Professor X, they determine that there are still Life Seeds lying in a dead Celestial Gardener killed by Apocalypse. They can salvage a new one, but they have a matter of getting X-Force back home. The answer is Gateway, who is imprisoned in the Akkaba prison known as The Sky. It is then agreed that Fantomex will take a team to retrieve the Life Seed while everyone else extracts Gateway. Once the meeting is adjourned, Wolverine is introduced to Kirika, daughter of AoA Wolverine and Mariko Yashida.\nMeanwhile, Fantomex tries talking to Psylocke about preventing another Apocalypse. He insisted that killing the child Apocalypse was the right thing to prevent him from becoming a monster. And the same thing will happen to Archangel. He tells her that she doesn't love Archangel, but is only helping him because she wants to be needed. In response, Psylocke punches him across the face. Fantomex then kisses her, telling her that the man she loves is already gone; she then pushes him away, refusing to give up.\nAs Fantomex takes Scott Summers, Rogue and Sunfire to find the Life Seed, everyone else flies in the captured Sentinel to infiltrate The Sky. Enroute, Wolverine has a talk with Kirika, telling her about how he loved the Mariko of his dimension \"to the Heavens\".\nOnce they arrive at The Sky, Magneto uses his powers to distract the Sentinels while the others infiltrate the prison, which Jean explains is a Master Mold. As they walk through the guardless prison, Wolverine tries convincing Jean to come back to his world. Unfortunately, they are interrupted by the Black Legion. Nightcrawler advises they run, for the Black Legion is too powerful for them to fight. Unfortunately, just as they make a run towards Gateway's cell, Kirika is incinerated by AoA Wolverine, who is guarding Gateway.\nThe Dark Angel Saga: part 2"

She is still on her way of finding her place in the world. She does not understand the virtue of kindness and how can people be kind even they experience misery. Jet even thinks that perhaps she should have allowed her father spread her consciousness across Earth, bringing the world under his control. Moments later, she watches two thugs kicking a defenseless man, \"Clammy\" Williams, in front of his own home. She tells the thugs to leave, and the defenseless Williams asks why did she not defend him. Jet coldly replies his safety is not his responsibility.\nMaking her way to another rooftop, Jet comes across a lonely man who recognizes her as Arnim Zola's daughter and invites her to a luxurious restaurant to have dinner with him. Apparently, Zola had made friends who would wait for Zola's child on Earth. The man introduces himself as Tsar Sultan, revealing he lived in Genosha alongside his parents. Sultan felt contempt towards the mutants, so he left to study abroad. He was not there when the Sentinels destroyed Genosha and killed his family. Sultan notes his father believed in kindness for all, but kindness did not save his life.\nBored by his story, Jet demands Sultan to take her to his boss and Sultan complies. He takes her to a building, where she finds the Red Skull with an enslaved Captain America on a leash. The Red Skull says he saw a kindred spirit in Jet's father and now, he is offering her a place in his side, something his father would have wanted. Suddenly, Zola appears behind Jet and urges her to accept her destiny in the new world they will all create together. Frightened, Jet leaves the building.\nIn all of sudden, Jet finds herself back in the alley she found Williams at. It was all an illusion. Williams is a telepath and he had presented her a choice and she almost made the wrong one. Williams returns home, leaving Jet alone in the cold, snowy alley.\n“THE IRON NAIL, PROLOGUE: A CHOICE”"

The sound scares his siblings, but he assures them that they are safe.\nIn the present, Sam is blaming himself for Ian Rogers/Nomad's death. Misty urges him to keep it together if they're going to stop Hydra's plan for the Inhuman boy's blood. They then split up. Sam opens a door to find himself in a World War II setting. He wonders if he had traveled back in time as he spots Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos before a tank blows them to smithereens. The tank is commanded by Sin herself. Her men restrain Sam to a mini tank. As she points a gun to his face, she decides against simply killing him and drops him down a hole, vowing to break him. As he is falling, Sam is shown images of his origin story before he became Falcon. Sin tells him that his whole backstory of crashing on the Isle of Exiles, rallying the tribals against the Red Skull, who used the Cosmic Cube to give him the ability to command birds, was a lie. She tells him that he's a liar, a thug and a gangster who ended up on the Isle of Exiles because of drug trafficking. Her father used the cube to rewrite his history to act his spy for many years. Sam refuses to hear her leis and breaks free. He then confronts Sin, who warns that his family will die if she is harmed. She'd called them off if he were to drop his wings and jump into the abyss before them. Sam reluctantly surrenders the shield and jumps.\nBelieving Sam is dead, Sin calls off the hit squad before ordering a viral campaign on Sam Wilson. She then contacts Baron Zemo, Crossbones and Taskmaster to get the go-ahead with their global sterilization master plan. She inoculates herself with the cure. After ending the video conference, she remarked to her dead father that she has always been the superior Shmidt. Suddenly, she is ambushed by Sam, who reveals that Redwing had been tracking them and caught his wings. He then demands to know how to deactivate the bomb. Sin refuses and shoots at him and goes to launch the bomb. Sam catches up and knocks her down, but the bomb is ten seconds from launching. So he throws the shield at one of the supports, causing the bomb to fall under its own weight. Sin tries to save the bomb and rejects Sam's attempt to save her and she goes down with the base. Though he reflects on Sin's choice and her mind games, Sam gathers his wits to go and save the world.\n• This is it! The new generations meet--Captain America vs Sin, daughter of the Red Skull!\n• The truth in regards to the blood of equalization is revealed, but Hydra’s proliferation is too wide, there is no stopping them now."

He thinks about how angry his father was, how normal it came to be for him, and how he became angry at others as well.\nVenom is in the middle of tracking Jack O'Lantern, who has been killing people and leaving a trail for Venom that he can see with night vision lenses. He believes Jack O'Lantern has escalated his killings because it's Father's Day and he's still upset over the death of Crime-Master, his adoptive father.\nFlash remembers a time when he was young and he regretted trading football cards with a boy named David. Drunkenly, his father went down the street and snatched the cards from out of David's hands. Harrison made a scene with David's father while everyone around them watched and threw the cards in Flash's face before leaving, saying that his father wouldn't have done that for him.\nAs he continues to track Jack O'Lantern, Venom thinks maybe he deserved his father's anger because he was a failure, but he knows that his father didn't love anyone because he was a broken man.\nFlash again recalls talking on the phone with Liz Allen and Harrison angrily went into his room and yelled at him for getting a speeding ticket. The fight escalated to the point that Harrison beat him violently while Flash's mother watched from outside his room.\nVenom follows the trail to a sewer. Walking through it, he thinks about how the good days in-between the bad days made everything worse because he thought his father had changed. He makes his way to a door. When he enters through it, he sees his father's corpse, his head illuminated by a candle inside his head, Jack O'Lantern's trademark. All of a sudden, the door slams shut and Jack O'Lantern's voice can be heard pretending to be Harrison's.\nAfter his father beat him, Flash is visited by his mother. He asked her why she let him beat him, but she blames Flash for provoking him.\nHarrison's corpse slumps over, revealing a bomb, which goes off immediately after.\nIn another flashback, Flash returns home and tells his family that he made the winning play for his team. His father doesn't care and tells him that his cousin graduated from medical school, a much more impressive feat.\nJack O'Lantern attacks Flash from behind. Flash remembers when his father hit Jessie, and then him when he tried to stop him. Jack O'Lantern slashes Venom's stomach and tells him about the things he learned about his father from Jessie.\nVenom crawls towards Harrison's corpse, and just as Jack O'Lantern is about to finish him off, Venom grabs Harrison's gun from out of its holster and shoots Jack O'Lantern multiple times, reminding him how angry and violent his father was. With Jack O'Lantern defeated, he drops his father's gun and lets him live, choosing instead not to let his father's anger poison him.\nIn the end, Jack is sent to the Raft and Flash tells the Secret Avengers everything. Betty throws out pictures of Flash. That night, Flash gets into bed and looks at a picture of his family before turning out the light.\nTHE SAVAGE SIX TOOK THEIR SHOT – NOW VENOM TAKES HIS!\n• With his darkest secrets exposed to those he loves, Flash Thompson has one name on his hit list: Jack O’Lantern!"

A prophecy has been pronounced, of dark days and an evil that will swallow the universe. All-new Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Voodoo is unused to operating on such a level. But he perseveres - and using a tip from Stephen Strange, he manages to lock the Dread Dormammu into a sub-dimension of his massive realm, and trap him with the Barrier Crows of Legba.\nReturning to his home in New Orleans, Doctor Voodoo is exhausted but survives the trip. He is greeted by his predecessor, Stephen Strange, and the ghost of his brother Daniel. Strange notes that Drumm has not slept in a week, but Voodoo has something to show him. Behind the Phantom Wall formed by the Lost Spirits of Shuma-Gorath, Doctor Voodoo has collected the Scying Stones of Chthon, mentioned in the dreaded Darkhold. Strange says he would never have used such dark magics, but Doctor Voodoo points out that he is no longer the Sorcerer Supreme.\nStrange acquiesces, and departs. Voodoo, despite not spleeping in a week, must depart for his other duty: he is the doctor at a free clinic in New Orleans. The nurse, Alexis, is angry at Doctor Voodoo for something that happened that previous night. However, she directs him to a man who booked himself in eight hours ago and waited for the Doctor.\nAs soon as the nurse leaves, however, the man reveals that he has been possessed by the Loa Marinette-Bwa-Chech. The Loa boasts that she killed a dozen children since Voodoo chose the Vishanti's prophecy over the underpriveleged of New Orleans. Doctor Voodoo summons his accroutements, but he is ambushed by Doctor Doom.\nAs a master magic user, Doom has spent years lusting after the power of the Eye of Agamotto. Now, with an untried Sorcerer Supreme, he is siezing his chance, and means to have the Eye. Doom tries to undermine Voodoo, calling him the harbinger of the Vishanti's prophecied darkness. As Doom cuts loose with his armor, Voodoo teleports the two of them away, leaving a wrecked clinic in their wake.\nOn a far world, the two materialize. Doom interfered with the spell, taking them to a world inhabited by Een'gawori slugs that eat magic, and no loas exist to aid Doctor Voodoo. After trying to undermine Doctor Voodoo yet again, Doom asks him for the Eye,\"for the good ofall\". However, Doctor Voodoo pushes the two of them of off a cliff.\nThe two sorcerers fall across the everdimensions, past beings and entities of incalculable power. Rime stetches like rubber, but Doctor Voodoo maintains his grip on the Eye. Eventually, they land on a dark shore by a dark castle. An enraged Doctor Doom resorts to physical force to beat Doctor Voodoo, and claims the Eye. However, the Eye shows him... something. Doctor Doom returns the Eye to Doctor Voodoo and proclaims the device cursed, before vanishing to his homeland. Leaving Doctor Voodoo to ask - what did Doom see?"

A masked woman left the club, intervened in their fight, and ran away with Cap before revealing herself to be Misty Knight. She stopped him from contacting Steve, revealing that Hydra has infiltrated everyone. Meanwhile the High Sect defeated Nomad and revealed the truth behind Lucas, including his blood having the Inhuman power to sterilize people, although developing an antidote afterwards. Zemo revealed his plan of the High Sect spreading across the globe to begin the great leveling to Nomad, believing that he wouldn't be there to stop it and slashed his throat.\n• The new Hydra has formed, comprised of the most ruthless villains of the Marvel Universe as the great infiltration continues!\n• Cap uncovers the ultimate goal of the new Hydra but is it too late to stop them?"

One of the scientists immediately began pushing for the project to try for the next stage of human evolution - forced roboticization. The other two argued against it, but the firt, the man they called \"Father\", insisted that life would find a way.\nToday, the Lighthouse, headquarters of the Secret Avengers, has just been attacked by a gang o android freedom fighters called the Adaptoids. Eugene Thompson, crippled, risks death in space to get the tools to save the Valkyrie, but they are both about to die - until Black Widow shows up to save them. She gets them to the Pymporter before the miniature space station burns up in Earth's atmosphere.\nMeanwhile, on a parallel Earth of the undead, Hawkeye & Captain Britain are fighting that world's Avengers over the Orb of Necromancy, which can deactivate the Descendants. The Avengers of the Undead have a plan to spread undeath across the multiverse in a conquering wave of postmortal existence... but the Secret Avengers grab the Orb and run.\nCaptain Britain tries to get away via a portal to Otherworld, but Brother Voodoo shuts it down; in his own universe, his magic is the strongest. Immediately afterwards, Thor blasts them with his hammer, forcing a crashlanding. The timely arrival of the Beast looks as if it will save them, but the portal closes behind him and the rest of the Avengers of the Undead show up...\nUsing the Pymporter, Black Widow's team lands in the last adress used - The Core, the robot city at the centre of the Earth. A civil war is going on, but the heroes make a beeline for the central building. There, Father is preparing for the final stage of his decades-long plan of contagious robot evolution: preserving human minds on nanoscale robotic pellets, and scattering them across the universe. Potentially, every human becomes a god. And they will be led in this by the first android on Earth: Jim Hammond, the Human Torch.\nIn another part of the Core, Deathlok Wasp has Hank Pym strapped to a machine. She explains that, in her time, Hank Pym's body was too mangled for the Deathlok process, and she was amazed to discover that she missed him. To the sound of Hank screaming, she explains that she will grant him immortality, then activates the machine. Within seconds, the Avenger has joined his wife - in inhumanity!\n• The robots of the Marvel Universe revolt!\n• The Avengers are taken down leaving only the Secret Avengers to stop Father’s automaton invasion and the plague of the Descendant’s contagious robot evolution!"

During her prayers, Jet admits to feeling drawn to Captain America. Even though she has been taught to hate the notions of compassion and temperance, she feels confused by Cap's decision to spare her life. As she finishes her praying, Jet asks Zola for salvation.\nA group of Zola's mutates guard the gate to Zola's stronghold until an out-of-control flying bike crashes into the gate. Then, Steve ambushes the mutants and swiftly kills them. Steve continues into the fortress, ready to put an end to Zola once and for all.\nMeanwhile, Jet puts a special armor on Ian so that he begins his new education today. Ian refuses to acknowledge Zola as his father, saying that Steve is his real father. He is also confused as why Jet is so loyal to him, and she replies that Zola taught her that life is a struggle in which one must destroy or be destroyed. However, Ian says that Steve taught him that the strong must always protect the weak and never lose hope. He also feels angry at Jet for causing misery to the Phrox, a good and peaceful race.\nAs Steve continues into Zola's fortress, he begins to think of the life he lost: he lost his friends, his responsibilities and Sharon.

He tells of how he mysteriously survived and found himself in a museum containing costumes of the previous Crime Masters. He tells he was desperate to reunite with her and be rid of Flash. Just then, a goon informs him of Flash's arrival.\nElsewhere, Venom is fighting Megatak, mentally noting that he hits harder than the Hulk. Then, out of nowhere, Toxin attacks, apparently destroying Megatak. Venom then attacks Toxin. After fooling him with smoke bombs and a decoy construct, he uses fire in an attempt to separate Eddie Brock from Toxin. But a second after he frees Brock, the symbiote ensnares him, dragging him into the fire. Knowing that his symbiote wouldn't survive long enough to rescue him, Flash leaves Brock to rescue Betty.\nAt that moment, Betty pleads with Bennett/Crime Master to spare Flash. Crime Master tells her that he's not a fool to expect that she'd be ready to become Crime-Mistress and betray him. Instead, he intends for Stockholm syndrome to whittle away that possibility. Also, even if he wanted to spare Venom after he hurt Betty and ruined his plans, he doubts that Venom would extend the same courtesy. Venom appear, saying that he will kill him. Jack O'Lantern flies up to intercept him but Venom attacks first and throws him into a vat of acid. He attempts to attack Crime Master but the villain fires a sonic gas from his gun before switching to a vaporized napalm mist, incapacitating Flash and weakening Venom. But before Crime Master could finish him off, Betty shoots him and he falls into the vat. Betty says that her brother died a long time ago.\nOnce they are far away from Crime Master's lair, Flash apologizes for all that's happened. Betty says that even if he hadn't attacked first, it would have changed nothing. Bennett would've come for her. She theorizes that perhaps Bennett figured out Flash's alter ego because of her.

Helicarrier,Earth-TRN461Creators and AppearancesCreatorsJim Krueger,Alex Ross,John Paul LeonFirstEarth X#3(April, 1999)\nIrises:\nThe origins of \"Spiders Man\" are shrouded in mystery. Before his mutation, he appears to have been a homeless man. He has stated that before his mutation he was \"nobody\".[1][2]After his mutation, he became a reptilian humanoid bearing resemblance to the costume of famous vigilanteSpider-Man. He gained the ability to cast \"webs\" that would cause vivid illusions.\nWhen theSkullbegan using his powers to create an army of mind controlled superhumans, Spiders Man was one of many who fell under his sway. He grew close toIron Maiden, another slave in the Skull's army whom he developed romantic feelings for.[3][4]Spiders Man marched with the Skull toNew York City, where they overthrewPresident Osborn. The Skull's reign was short however, asCaptain Americamanaged to launch an attack and assassinate the Skull, freeing Spiders Man.[5]\nWorking under theSkull\nJust after the Skull's death, Spiders Man looked on in horror as the Final Host ofCelestialsarrived to scour theEarthof all life, in defense of the Celestial embryo growing in Earth's core. The Celestials were defeated byGalactus, who was convinced to remove the embryo without destroying the planet.[6][7]\nFollowing the death of the Celestial embryo, the planet underwent a massive ecological collapse due to the loss of mass caused by the removal of the embryo. Once again without purpose, Spiders Man was recruited by the time-travelingImmortus, whoseChurchpreached that the destiny of mutated man lay in leaving the Earth behind and conquering the stars. This put them at odds withReed Richards, who was attempting to purge theTerrigen Mistfrom Earth's atmosphere in a bid to reverse the mutations. Unbeknownst to any of the members, Immortus' right-hand manMr. Churchwas in actualityMephisto.[4]\nSpiders Man was recruited by theS.H.I.E.L.D.ofEarth-TRN461into theSpider-Men, a group of Spider-Man analogs, to help battle theMultiversal Sinister Six. She also became a member of theSpider-Force. During his initial stay, he attempted to spread the Church of Immortus into Earth-TRN461.[8]\nAmong theSpider-Men\nAs hunger grew widespread, Spiders Man used his powers to help the church recruit.[4]His association with the church would cost him his friendship with Iron Maiden, who believed that Immortus was just another dictator like the Skull.[9]TheNYPDrealized that taking out Spiders Man would be key in hampering the church's ability to recruit, dispatchingSpider-Manto stop him.[2]\nHowever, in the resulting battle, Spiders Man used his illusions on Spider-Man, only for the latter to take control of the illusion, creating a world where all the tragedies and mistakes that had befallen him never happened. Spiders Man found himself trapped in his own illusion. They were eventually discovered by Spider-Man's daughterVenom, who used the powers of hersymbioteto enter the illusion. After learning what had happened from Spiders Man, she attempted to reason with her father, but failed to get through to him. When she learned that she didn't exist in her father's perfect world, she was driven into a rage and nearly killed Spiders Man before her father snapped out of the illusion and stopped her.[2]\nSpiders Man was convinced to give himself up and be taken into custody.[2]Spider-Man approached him in his cell, offering him the chance to leave the church and join them. Spiders Man realized that Iron Maiden was right, and that the church would kill whoever got in their way. Realizing his mistake, he agreed to join the NYPD.[10]\nUsually Spiders Man uses his powers to make someone relive some of their most tragic moments, like making Captain America relive the death of Bucky, to making the Thing relive the death of the Human Torch. He once even tried to make Peter Parker see his old rogues gallery. It appears that these illusions have some sort of visual element, as someone who shields their eyes do not seem to be effected by the illusions effects."

Presumably, his history on Earth-9997 is similar to that of hisEarth-616 counterpart.\nWhenSpiders Manattempted to use his illusion powers against Peter Parker, Parker some how took control of Spiders Man's illusions and created his own fantasy world.

Then, Shatterstar walks in and tells Rictor that he needs to see the news report on TV as it pertains to his family.\nCable and Domino talk to Paige Guthrie about her recent assistance in the defeat of the Gamesmaster. She tells them that she cannot go back to the Guthrie farm as she has yet to understand her powers. Cable tells her that he does not have the time or resources to help her and she tells him that Charles Xavier was who she had thought would be able to.\nRictor and Shatterstar watch the news report, which talks of the capture of Rictor's uncle, Gonzalo and cousin, Omar.

He tells them to wait outside and he enters the house. He is greeted by his stepmother and family. They ask how he has been and try to catch up.

Cable tells him that it was not him and stops the bullet. Rictor sees the exchange and recounts how Stryfe was the man who really killed his father.\nRictor then storms out of the house and hits the gang that has surrounded his friends with a vibration wave. His family is amazed at his reaction and he yells at them all to stop the violent nature they have brought on both him and themselves all these years. He then leaves his family. Later, he is at the bedside of his cousin in the hospital. He tells him that he must go to jail for his crimes and then leaves town."

Jean, now named Redd trains Nathan Dayspring/Summers to hone his telekinetic powers to hide his cybernetic arm from public sight. He finally accomplishes this and after sneaking around he learns that Redd and Cyclops, now Slym, are actually involved in a band of rebels dubbed \"Clan Rebellion\". They are planning a raid on one of Apocalypse's strongholds that night.\nMeanwhile, Ch'Vayre is seeing that Apocalypse is very close to his newly appointed heir, Stryfe. Apocalypse oversees him killing innocent humans to learn how to control his power. Ch'Vayre is disgusted by Stryfe's carelessness.\nIn the labs that the clan have raided, it is soon discovered that Apocalypse has engineered a virus very similar, if not identical to the \"Legacy Virus\" that has been unleashed on human/mutantkind in earth's current timeline. Redd and Slym learn they must destroy this technology. Before they can do this, Ch'Vayre and his soldiers appear. Nathan is seen to have followed the clan on this raid and he hides in a computer room where he begins to have a telepathic conversation with a voice named \"Rachel\". She teaches him of computers and how to set the labs to self-destruct. Stryfe finds him there and they realize they are clones of eachother. Stryfe uses his powers and gets knocked out. Nathan on the other hand also uses his powers and this allows the techno-organic virus in his body to take over and mangle his body. He finally gets it under control and Ch'Vayre takes Stryfe's body to Apocalypse's citadel to recover. The labs finally destruct as Skerrit, Turrin, Redd, Slym and Nathan all escape. Nathan tells them of his \"talk\" with a woman named Rachel.\nLater, Slym goes to the bedside of Rachel, his daughter of another future, and thanks her for saving their family and helping out the cause. He tells her he knows her body is not awake but her mind is and that he loves her. Ch'Vayre is then seen contemplating the actions of Stryfe in battle and does not think he is a good heir to Apocalypse and thinks he should not allow Apocalypse to use him as a host body and he plots on how to keep that from happening."

He meets with others who call themselves High-Lords of the Externals. He announces to them that he has made a mistake in training Sunspot and he is not the next High-Lord, but that he is aware of who is. He says that he recommends that they send out Krule to retrieve Cannonball for them and this is so that they keep their involvement quiet if there are problems. Some of the group do not agree with his recommendation. He also states that he is going to take Sunspot out, since he is no longer needed and he has wasted too much time on him and he wasn't even the High-Lord.\nMLF safehouseWeapon X takes on the MLF by himself.

He barges his way into the office of General Clarke. He states that SHIELD and G.W.

Rictor says that he is ready to help bring down Cable.\nTolliver's hideoutTolliver brings Deadpool in and asks if they have heard anything from \"her\" on Cable.

Bridgemeet withGarrison Kane. Kane is heightening his skills inside an underground bunker. G.W. explains to Kane that Cable has just been seen attacking the MLF members.

The curator finds some figures on the hilt of the sword that resemble old figures on other pieces of art throughout history. They show pictures of Apocalypse-like artwork. The curator also says that the artwork on one of the hieroglyphs is also on a piece that is in that same museum. Cable decides that the MLF is going to try to steal this piece of art.\nLater, the MLF does teleport into the museum. They are suddenly ambushed by Cable. They cannot find out how he is getting to the places they are stealing from before they do. They attack each other and Cable shootsReaper's hand off.

He sits down and questions theprofessorabout why Stryfe would be going after all these pieces of artwork.

Meanwhile, inSwitzerland, Cable and Kane argue about their past and Kane says their deal they made was that Kane would help Cable get Stryfe if Cable would help saveHammer.\nSix years ago inSingapore, Six Pack is hiding out when they are being hunted in a warehouse by men sent by Tolliver to kill Six Pack since they betrayed him. They argue about the reason that Cable broke the contract in the first place.Dominofinally grabs an explosive and blows up the warehouse. Cable once again tells his teammates to trust him.\nIn the current day'sYucatanjungle, just outside ofCancun, Kane and Cable hunt down the tracking device on the mask the MLF stole. They search through the jungle and find the signal coming from an ancient temple. As they both enter they are immediately attacked by MLF members. Cable uses his power and knocks them all out. They enter a tunnel and find the mask on a wall on the back. They turn around and find the MLF have followed them into the tunnel and it is a trap. Then Stryfe teleports behind Kane and he grabs him.

Cable bodyslides away and leave the team to fend for themselves. Domino,Grizzly, and G.W. take off while Hammer lies on the ground and Kane is also wounded. The place blows up.\nCurrent day, in the Yucatan temple, Stryfe tells Cable that he wants the \"Professor\" that Cable uses. He says that he belongs toApocalypse. He tells Cable that he will exchange the professor for Kane. Cable says he will only pass it over if Kane is released. Stryfe lets him go and Cable shows him a CD and then burns it. Stryfe attacks Cable with a massive TK-attack. Cable sees Stryfe's power is enormous. Kane grabs hold of Stryfe's armor with his mechanical hands that he shoots at him. He then engages an electrical shock across the wires and electrocutes Stryfe and Cable grabs Kane and they teleport away. Stryfe vows to hunt down Cable for this. Kane wakes up on a vertical bed and Cable stands by watching after him. He welcomes Kane toApplecrustand says that he has given him new arms. They walk out on the balcony and Cable says that the current timeframe is after Apocalypse has been destroyed and that they will find something in this time that can heal Hammer.\nPages:48"

He tells his old master he deserves the suffering he’s enduring and leaves the cave.\nIn the Celestial City, Deadpool tells Domino and X-23 that he knows what is disrupting their time-travel devices, and it’s not a thing or a place - it’s a person.

Warpath resists Stryfe’s attempts to pry into his mind while Stryfe studies over Hope. As Hope stares back, she begins to notice Cable’s features beneath Stryfe’s helmet, wondering if this masked man could be her “father” in disguise come to rescue her.\nBishopwatches from the shadows, reflecting on the 12 years he has spent hiding thoughts of Hope from Stryfe. Seeing his chance to finally kill Hope, Bishop presses a button on his cybernetic arm and triggers a nanite bomb that briefly incapacitates Stryfe. The psionic bubble dissipates, freeing Hope and giving Bishop his shot. He aims his weapon at the girl and fires.\nBishop’s bullet is frozen in mid-air and his gun begins to disassemble in his hand. Stryfe is back on his feet. He brushes off attacks from Bishop and pins him against the wall, turning his powers on his uneasy ally. He probes Bishop’s mind and learns that he was trying to kill Hope. Stryfe turns his attention to the girl and realizes she sees Cable as her father. Hope, convinced Stryfe is in fact Cable, lifts Stryfe’s helmet. She sees Cable’s face and runs into his arms.
