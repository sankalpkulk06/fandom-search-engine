From then on, Justin grew estranged from Jung-Woo.[4]As the years went by, Justin Jin developed a massive bulk for a teenager his age, becoming a proficient basketball player.[2]\nWhen Justin was seventeen years old, Jung-Woo mysteriously died and he received his father's belongings, which included a small jewelry box containing a fragment of theCrimson Gem of Cyttorak. After making contact with the artifact, Justin was empowered with the vast strength of the unstoppable Juggernaut.[4]As the transformation was witnessed by his mother, she shared his family's story with him, including the fate of his late grandfather, who had been killed byCain Markofor the mantle of the Juggernaut, and his late father's refusal to take the powers of the Juggernaut out of shame. Justin and Hae-Ran were then confronted byMalphegor, a follower ofCyttorakwho wished to acquire the power of the Juggernaut for himself and had murdered Jung-Woo for his artifact before realizing that he sent it to his son.[5]Justin and Malphegor battled in the streets of Vancouver until \"Doctor Strange\" intervened to rescue Justin. Strange and Justin teleported to one of Cyttorak's temples in theNorth Shore Mountains, where Strange tapped into the temple's mystical energies to protect Justin and explained Malphegor's past to him. Malphegor tracked the two down and at Strange's urging, Justin embraced his family legacy and summoned his own suit ofJuggernaut Armor.[6]Justin beat down Malphegor and destroyed his staff, which depowered him. Strange ordered Justin to kill Malphegor but he refused, realizing that therealDoctor Strangewould never encourage murder. Strange revealed himself to be Cyttorak in disguise and declared both Malphegor and Justin to unworthy of being his avatar after pitting the two against each other. Justin refused to play into Cytorrak's game after what he did to his family but Cyttorak mocked him as Justin only inherited a portion of his power and left Justin to himself as he had bigger plans for him. Justin traveled back on foot to his mother's bakery and expressed his worry over Cytorrak's plans for him, but Hae-Ran encouraged him to train and hone his powers to be ready to face Cyttorak again. After reading his father's letter, which told him to be a better and stronger version of him, Justin embraced his new identity and becameKid Juggernaut.[7]\nWhile trying to be a superhero in Vancouver, Kid Juggernaut was approached byAlpha Flight, but was put off by their intense approach. He also battled a gaze of raccoons that believed were being controlled by a super villain (though they turned out to be regular raccoons), was present when someSkrullsrevealed themselves, and help rescue pets from trees.[3]"

At some time in the future, a caravan of people make their way to a futuristic city in the desert.

The Moon Knight blasts Cage, destroying his arm temporarily, but Cage fights back, yelling that while the world grieved during the \"White Sky Event\", he rescuedStark Unlimitedand mastered \"the Eye\" before he turned against everyone for Khonshu. One punch shatters Moon Knight's mask and the figure stands revealed - Danny Rand - who calls Cage the monster. However, another strikes both Cage and Rand, showing more visions of the past:\nTombstonestanding tall in Manhattan.Doctor Doom, the new Sorcerer Supreme.

Cage, tired of his talk, blasts him off planet. However, Danny conjures up a sickle and slices off Cage's right arm. He taunts Cage about trying to stand up against the Moon, but Cage replies that he's a Hulk and Hulks smash, slamming Danny into the Moon. He apologizes for having done that, but Danny rises, another voice declaring that he was already dead. As he fights, Cage is flooded with more visions:\nFrank Castlein the War Machine armor battlingJoe Garrison.Spider-Boyalongside an entire team of teenaged heroes.Franklin Richardsrepowered.

However, it's a trick as Khonshu pulls himself out of Danny's body. At long last, Khonshu begins the culling of the world and the rest of the universe, becoming a Celestial. However, Cage is not out of the fight. Wrapping his chains around his remaining hand, he charges towards Khonshu, flanked by images of his wife and his fellow New Avengers. With this power, he smashes through Khonshu, destroying him. As the world starts to heal, Cage lets himself be pulled into the timestream, being greeted with new visions:\nStephen StrangeandCleawelcoming a new child.

The radiation, however, seemed to be slowly killing it. Before it died it managed to bite a student fromMidtown High Schoolnamed ofPeter Parker. The spider's venom caused changes to Peter's DNA that gave him certain abilities of a spider, such as the proportionate strength and agility along with the ability to climb on any surface. He could now react to danger quickly with a \"spider-sense\".[2]\nThe spider also had time to bite another person after Peter:Cindy Moon, who got the same abilities as Spider-Man. She later took up the identity ofSilk.[3]\nHowever, rather than dying after this, as was assumed, the gamma radiation that the spider absorbed had actually transformed it into a \"Hulk-Spider\". Additionally, while the two she had bitten gained the abilities and strength of a spider, the spider herself gained the abilities and intelligence of a human. When she awoke she found herself trapped in a glass cage and split in two by theIsotope Genome Accelerator.[1]\nA student by the name ofCarl King, who witnessed Peter being bitten and connected it with the appearance of Spider-Man, broke into the facility ate one of the two spiders, hoping to gain the same powers of Spider-Man. His body began to break down over time, mutating him into a swarm of a thousand spiders sharing a single consciousness known as the Thousand.[4]The other spider maintained a connection to the Thousand until its death, hearing her own voice within each member of the swarm.[1]\nDue to having been turned into aGamma mutate, the original spider not only continued to live on but became capable of increasing her size to massive proportions. Though originally mute, she quickly learned to speak under the tutelage of the scientist who adopted her and gave her the name \"Goddess\". Many years later, their lab was destroyed by theGreen Goblinduring a fight with Silk and Spider-Man. Feeling her connection to the two of them and inspired by their heroism, Goddess left her adopted father's lab to become a hero of her own.[1]\nGamma Mutate Physiology: Goddess, after her accident, gained the standardextreme gamma-related power set, including but not limited to enhanced size, strength, and durability. Her size is especially notable, as she eventually reaches a size comparable to that of a human. Also much like the Hulk, she can naturally irradiate and mutate people through the gamma found within her body, as was the case with the creation of the Thousand.[1][4]\nSpider-Sense: Goddess has a Spider-Sense similar to Peter and Cindy's, which allowed her to recognize the two many years later as her \"family\".[1]"

During the battle, Rex activated her jetpack and left the scene while Cindy and Peter realized they were depowered. They were only able to escape Hydra due to the timely intervention ofBen Parker.\nPeter explained to him that he and Silk were superheroes from the future. Skeptical, Ben interrogated a Hydra agent who not only backed up their story, revealed that they believed Rex to be the future counterpart ofAgent James Harper. Searching the home ofJamesandMaria Harper, they found the home in ruins, possibly the results of domestic abuse. Ben discovered a note saying \"Gone toMartha's\" and the three went to the home of Maria's sister. Finding Maria in Martha'sHell's Kitchenhome, Harper revealed that Hydra had a base inRed Hook.\nLosing faith in the mission, Peter began to pout until a newspaper landed on his face. Reading the headline and then showing it to Cindy, they set out to fix their other problem: being de-powered. On the way to theNew York Hall of Science, they accidentally causedDr. Eric Schwinnerto be stuck in traffic. When they got to the laboratory, she noticed herpast counterpartand her boyfriend,Hector Cervantez, were leaving she tried to stop them, but failed.

Jameson and the other thirty-five people on the Nautilus became the last of the humanity in their universe apart fromBenjamin Parker, who survived in a bunker beneath theSims Tower. Because the station had very limited supplies, Jameson used the only available spacecraft to make weekly trips to the surface, protected by a radiation suit. This allowed the survivors to maintain the Nautilus for over three years, during which time John married a woman namedAnnie.[1]\nUnknown to them, the bunker under Sims Tower became used as a holding cell forInheritors, a family of interdimensional vampiric beings. They were thought to be contained, but eventually found a way to escape to another reality. After that,Vernareturned to retrieve the crystal containing the essence of her fatherSolus. Jameson unknowingly picked up the crystal on his latest run and was confronted byKaine,Jessica Drew,Ashley Barton, andCharlie Parkerwho arrived to stop Verna.[2]"

Because his father's genetic code was altered when he received his powers, there were several anomalies in Mary Jane's pregnancy which had a high risk for both her and the baby. Due to the risk to Mary Jane's health, her obstetrician advised her to consider abortion.[4]However, remembering that she had faced similar risks when pregnant with her daughter May, Mary Jane decided to to proceed with the pregnancy.[4]\nBen was born while his sister was fightingSeth, and to his family's relief, was apparently a perfectly healthy, normal little boy.[5]\nHis first nameBenjaminis in honor of hisuncleandgranduncle, while his second nameRichardis in honor of hisgrandfather.[5]\nBenjamin began to display some superhuman abilities,[6]namely balancing a toy block on one finger while spinning his arm at a fast speed and also being able to dangle the block from his finger on a web-like string.[6]\nBonded toCarnage\nHe was bonded to a part of theCarnage Symbioteand became a miniature Carnage. After his sister freed him from the Symbiote by using the ultrasonic weaponry of the villainReverb, his father noticed that Ben wasn't responding to his voice and that his ears were bleeding and realized that Ben had lost his hearing, likely because Ben's ears were far too underdeveloped to withstand the sonic waves. The doctors in the hospital were still trying to determine whether Ben's hearing loss was temporary or permanent and May was deeply upset about this and blamed herself.[7]Nevertheless, Ben still seemed to be his usual, happy self. Since discovering her baby brother crawling on the ceiling she feared that due to his exposure to the symbiote, his abilities had somehow been jump started far too early (as hers only came about in her teens) possibly making him more powerful than his father and sister as his powers manifested during infancy.[8]\nNormie Osbornlater agreed to fund an operation to restore Benjamin's hearing. The operation was a success, restoring most if not all of Ben's hearing.[9]When his sister was temporarily replaced by herclonehe was shown to be frightened of her[10]and was then later kidnapped alongside his mother by the being calling itself Goblin God who was a combination of his father, sister and his sister's clone all combined into one who threw him and his mother off of theBrooklyn Bridgewhich caused Benjy to fire off webbing strong enough to keep the two of them suspended safely.[11]\nAfter Peter and Mary Jane died protecting May and Benjy from the Totem hunterDaemos, Spider-Girl took Benjy and escaped from this universe with the help of two other Spider-Men who had arrived to save them.[12]He was often under the care ofCosmic Spider-Manwhile May went on missions.[13]During the attack of theInheritorsonEarth-13Benjy was revealed to beThe Scion, one of the most important Spider-Totems in existence (alongsideThe OtherandThe Bride).[2]\nWhen theSpider-Armydecided to go on their final attack against the Inheritors after they had also gathered The Other and The Bride and were going to sacrifice them for a ritual,Ben ParkerfromEarth-3145rescued Benjy and travelled to his universe, where he kept him safe during the battle, in which the Inheritors were finally defeated.[14]\nBenjy was suddenly transported toEarth-91029byAshiya Domanand abducted by the leader of theSymbiote Hive,Shuten Doji, to use him in the invasion ofJapan. The boy was forcefully bonded to a symbiote which took the form of a giant spider that duplicated itself, creating an army of arachnid symbiotes that would be known as the tsuchigumo. Thankfully, he was freed by local heroKid Venomand brought to the Sorcerer SupremeAbe no Seimei, but despite being free Benjy remained connected to the symbiotes who kept going on a rampage. After Seimei deduced that the baby originated from an alternate reality, Kid Venom planned to return him to his home reality to sever the connection and defeat the symbiotes.[3]\nHe has demonstrated superhuman abilities similar or equal to his father and sister. He balanced a toy block on one finger while spinning his arm at a fast speed.\nRed-and-Black Symbiotic Costume:FormerlythoseofCletus KasadyofEarth-616when bonded to theCarnagesymbiote."

While imprisoned for his crimes as theGreen Goblin, Osborn convinced his sonHarry Osbornto attack Warren's lab. Harry obliged, and discovered the clone, along with a clone of his father and Peter's wifeGwen Stacy.\nBelieving that his father had commissioned the clone of Peter as his new heir, an enraged Harry attempted to kill them all. Gwen convinced Peter to save the clones, however, only Ben survived. To his horror, Peter would learn that the supposed clone of Gwen had in fact been the original, who had been kidnapped and replaced by Warren, who was obsessed with Gwen. Now given a chance at a real life, the clone took the name \"Ben Parker\" and left New York with theclone of Gwen, now using the name \"Helen Parker\".[2]\nBen eventually moved to Chicago where he worked as a photographer. At some point, he and Helen split up and went their separate ways. WhenAunt Maypassed away, Ben secretly attended her funeral. Despite supposedly living a quiet life, Ben could not resist being a vigilante, and fought crime as the \"Red Mask\".\nIn 1995 an ageing Ben was kidnapped byOtto Octavius. Octavius had seen Ben at May's funeral and deduced his true identity. Seeking to prolong his life, he wished to unlock the secrets of cloning that had died with Miles Warren, and needed Peter and Ben to help him reverse engineer the process. While examining them, Octavius discovered that Ben was in fact the original and Peter the clone.\nAfter defeating Otto, Peter gave all the codes for his company Parker Industries, his Spider-Man suits, and detailed information on his life, claiming that Ben should finally be allowed to achieve his potential. Ben in turn gave Peter the mask he had worn as a vigilante. While Ben wholeheartedly believed that he was the original, it was in fact a ruse byNorman Osborn, a last ditch effort at ruining Peter's life. Peter was fully aware that Ben truly was the clone, using this as an opportunity to retire as Spider-Man.[1]\nBen replaced Peter not only as head of Paker Industries but as Spider-Man, spending a decade fighting crime in New York. WhenMorluncame to hunt theSpider-Totemof this reality, he sought out Ben, but soon deduced that Ben was a clone. The two fought, but Ben was no match for Morlun, who killed him.  His death was broadcast to the world, revealing Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man.[3]"

When Harry was 11, his fatherNormansent him to a boarding school, and for his sixteenth birthday sent him a bottle of scotch (though it was obvious that it had in fact been sent by an Oscorp employee). Events like these caused Harry to resent his father. At one point, Harry had a fling with a French supermodel. He also began to experience symptoms of his father's illness.\nBefore mutation\nIn 2014, the 20-year-old Harry returned home just before his dad passed away. Harry was now Oscorp's CEO and was soon reunited with his childhood friend. The two caught up, and Peter informed Harry aboutGwen Stacy. Harry also became convinced that the blood of Spider-Man (whom he had figured out had gotten his powers from one of the now-destroyed spiders) would be able to cure him. Knowing that Peter had taken photos of the hero, Harry asked him to get in touch with Spider-Man. Later, Spider-Man appeared in Harry's home, but refused to give him his blood regardless of what Harry offered him, as he believed his blood would have a negative effect on Harry if it wasn't compatible.\nHarry became increasingly desperate untilhis assistantinformed him that Oscorp had drained venom from the spiders before destroying them. He tried to find out where it was stored, but came across information aboutElectroand was quickly locked out of the system.Donald Menkenframed Harry to save himself, and had him fired. Enraged, Harry sought out Electro, who was at the time being held at Ravecroft, and freed him.\nTogether with Electro, Harry headed back to Oscorp and took Menken hostage while sending Electro off to take out the city's power. Menken took Harry down into a secret area and was forced to inject Harry with the spider venom. The venom had a violent effect on Harry, seemingly accelerating the disease rather than curing it. In pain, he crawled over to an Oscorp prototype exo-skeleton suit and glider. Upon putting it on, the suit healed the damages done to his system.\nHarry flew to the power plant on the glider, arriving shortly after Electro's defeat, the spider venom now seeming to be affecting his mind as well. Noticing Gwen with Spider-Man, he quickly realized that Spider-Man was Peter Parker. In a rage, Harry decided to destroy Peter's \"hope\": Gwen. Harry grabbed Gwen and flew away, with Peter giving chase. Shortly after, he threw her down into a clock tower, where Peter was able to catch her. Harry began fighting Spider-Man inside of the nearby clock tower, however Gwen was ultimately killed in the ensuing battle. Harry was knocked out and taken to Ravencroft, though Gwen's death caused Peter to give up the mantle of Spider-Man.\nSpider Venom-Enhanced Physiology:In an attempt to cure himself of his illness, Harry exposed himself to the venom of Oscorp's modified spiders for their self-healing ability, but this caused him to mutate violently and he used an experimental OsCorp suit to cure himself. Unlike Peter, he did not obtain a healing factor to cure himself of his disease."

When her \"Uncle Ben\" was murdered byMorlun, Claire reasoned with her father to take action, prompting him to travel to New York both to clear his name, square away with Parker Industries, and hopefully also lure Morlun away from his family. Unfortunately, Morlundidassault the Parker household during Peter's absence, and resolved to consume Claire and Benjy as a \"snack\" until he could find their father. As Morlun attempted to feed from Claire, she instinctively swiped him across his face, drawing blood. The family fled into the woods, but upon noticing that Claire was able to injure Morlun, Benjy deduced that he is vulnerable when he is feeding.  Benjy used himself as bait, giving Claire the opportunity to strike Morlun with a splintered log of wood, impaling him.[3]Claire would eventually become her own hero, being among the next generation of heroes who survived the Civil War and Doom's rise to power.[4]"

Through many trial and error, the results led to the birth of Scarlet Spider as a half-human synthezoid, Doctor Octavius then implanted false memories into him and kept his true origin a secret.\nAfter Hydra attacked S.H.I.E.L.D. with Doctor Octopus forced to work for them, Scarlet Spider save Spider-Man from drowning and soon help him and save his friends and defeat Hydra while expressing a personal Vendetta against Doc Ock. Afterwards Scarlet joined his team ofWeb-Warriors.[3][4]\nWhen Vulture warned Spider-Man about a spy atS.H.I.E.L.D.whose \"not a spider\", the Web-Warriors began investigating their other teammates on who the spy might be. Some of them suspect the traitor to be Curt Connors due his past as the Lizard and previous alliance with Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man quickly dismisses only find that Dr. Connors injects himself with the Lizard DNA once again and destroyed all most of his antidote, this time the Lizard is can infect others via bite, turning Scarlet and most of the residence at theTriskelioninto Lizards.

Later, she gave birth to a baby boy. When Gerald \"Gerry\" Drew was born, he was diagnosed with a strange blood-borne disorder due to radiation exposure in the womb. Apparently, Jessica's powers had harmed her unborn child. When doctors and medicines were unable to help her son, Jessica recreated the experiment that cured her of her radiation poisoning, the experiment that made her Spider-Woman. The experiment imbued young Gerry with spider-like powers, but didn't cure him. The trauma caused by Gerry's illness caused his parents to split up. Young Gerry felt that it was his fault that his parents divorced, and became withdrawn. Jessica tried to alleviate his pain by telling him stories from her past, his favorites involvedSpider-Man.[citation needed]\nAs Spider-Man\nDetermined to make his short time on Earth count, Gerry designed his own Spider-Man costume and convinced his mother to train him in how to use his powers. On his first trial as Spider-Man, Gerry dropped by theDaily Bugleand shocked bothJ. Jonah Jamesonand Peter Parker (the original Spider-Man) with \"the return of Spider-Man\". Soon after, Spider-Man metSpider-Girland the two did not get along. During one fight between several villains, Spider-Girl and the new Spider-Man got in each other's way to the point that the villainCrazy 8died when he was shot by a bullet intended for Spider-Man (but Spider-Girl shoved him out of its way). Upset by the fact that he was responsible for Crazy 8's death, Gerry tried to make up for his mistakes and end up running intoDarkdevil.[citation needed]"

Despite being frustrated by his antics, by working together they managed to foil a bank robbery until they were attacked byLoki, who attempted to recruit Deadpool to a team of villains he was putting together. Sakura Spider was begrudgingly impressed when Deadpool's apparent bluff of having called theAvengersscared Loki away, and awestruck whenCaptain Americaarrived on the scene.[5]Speaking privately with Captain America, Haruka protested Deadpool's recruitment to Samurai Squad but was told that Wade Wilson's bizarre attitude was his way of coping with the grief of having lost everyone he cared about.[6]\nSakura Spider and Deadpool were dispatched to recruit the teenage idol-singerNeiro Aratabi, who was the host of asymbioteshe calledKage.[7]Chastising Deadpool not to do anything to embarrass her, Sakura Spider revealed she was a massive fan of Neiro and was accused of having a crush on her by Deadpool. After watching Neiro's performance, she and Deadpool unsuccessfully attempted to sneak past the security guards and were chased  outside. Spotting Neiro being attacked by Loki, Sakura Spider used her webbing to sling Deadpool at him before being subdued by the security guards.[8]\nTo Haruka's delight, Neiro joined the rest of Samurai Squad in protecting an interdimensional portal device fromHydraagents and a clone ofThanos.[9]Returning to base to prepare for the final battle against Loki and his army, Sakura Spider apologized for her early bad attitude towards Deadpool, but was stopped from asking him about his past by Neiro. Haruka was distraught when Neiro abruptly left the team to perform at a concert, and - reflecting on how her attitude towards Deadpool had changed - stepped out into traffic without paying attention and was promptly run over by a truck and a car, leaving her hospitalized.[6]Despite being unable to take part in the final battle, she rallied the Avengers to come to Deadpool's aid,[10]and he in turn expressed confidence that she would be able to handle any villains who tried to threaten Japan in the future.[11]"

But while she was away, Ajei's grandmother fell mysteriously ill and became too frail to continue weaving the beautiful textiles that paid Ajei's tuition.\nReturning home from college, Ajei decided to make it her mission to discover what made her grandmother sick and find a cure. Ajei remembered tales of the Na’ashjeii Asdzáá, a Navajo Spider Deity who protects and guides those in need and set off to find her. Deep in the desert, she found an empty spider web glistening with dewdrops and placed her palm against the web. A great pain shot through her hand, and as she recoiled, she discovered a spider sitting in the middle of the web. Returning home, Ajei was overcome with a fever and, in her sleep, had visions of Na’ashjeii Asdzáá. She told Ajei about theWeb of Life and Destinyand that a powerful being was tainting her grandmother’s thread in the hopes of cursing the Na’ashjeii Asdzáá's past and future weavers. But with Ajei's help, the Na’ashjeii Asdzáá could free her grandmother and protect the web.\nAjei awoke, dazed but rested, and while contemplating her dreams, began a weaving project. But without even thinking, Ajei began producing mystical silk, which transformed into a uniform with a powerful spider design. Rushing to her grandmother, Ajei showed her the mystical silk when suddenly she sprouted ethereal spider arms, which she used to cleanse the Web of Life, healing her grandmother and thwarting whoever sought to hurt the weavers."

Michael Straczynski,John Romita, Jr.FirstDeathAmazing Spider-Man(Vol. 2) #30(April, 2001)Amazing Spider-Man#508(June, 2004)\nIrises:\nEzekiel Sims, a recipient ofSpider-Totempowers through a mysterious ritual, sought fortune following his newfound abilities similar toSpider-Man's. Recognizing his totemic nature and the threat from higher-order beings, Ezekiel took measures to protect future Spider-Totems from entities likeMorlun. He joined theSpider Society, aiding in the formation ofWebCorpsas a front. He mentoredCindy Moon, another bitten by aRadioactive Spider, training her until realizing Morlun was tracking her. To safeguard her, Ezekiel secluded Cindy in a special room.[2]\nMonitoringPeter Parker's development as Spider-Man, Ezekiel warned him of Morlun's pursuit. Despite urging Peter to hide, he faced Morlun himself to prevent casualties.[3]In a confrontation with Morlun, Ezekiel saved Spider-Man's life but disappeared after a subsequent fight.[4]Ezekiel later aided Spider-Man againstShathra, guiding him to a sacred temple inGhanaand warning him of imminent threats beyond Morlun.[5]As the Gatekeeper targeted Ezekiel for his accidental acquisition of powers, their conflict escalated. Ezekiel, deemed unworthy by theGatekeeper, plotted against Spider-Man, ultimately sacrificing himself to save Peter, realizing his life pursuit of wealth was misguided.[1]\nRitual\nEzekiel apparently underwent some form of ritual which granted him the powers of aSpider-Totem. Upon being granted these powers, similar toSpider-Man's powers, he set about amassing a fortune. He soon learnt that, being totemic in nature, he would be beset by those of orders higher up the totemic hierarchy.[3]\nOne of these beings,Morlun, would become something of a nemesis to him, and Ezekiel began to take steps to gather all the information he could on Morlun to protect the future generations of Spider-Totems, paying for bunkers to be constructed which would block out anyone who could find those with ties to the totem-order. Ezekiel also became a member of theSpider Society, helping found WebCorps to serve as a front.[citation needed]\nMeeting Peter Parker\nWhen Peter Parker andCindy Moonwere bitten by a spider that had been irradiated by a particle accelerator used in a demonstration of the safe handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials, sponsored by the General Techtronics Corporation, Ezekiel contacted Cindy and trained her in the use of her powers until he realized that Morlun was tracking her. He then locked her away in one of his special rooms at the bottom of his tower to protect her from the Devourer of Totems.[2]\nHe also monitored Peter's progress as the superpowered vigilante Spider-Man. When it became apparent Morlun would target Peter, Ezekiel confronted him, claiming to have hired several detectives to discover certain parts of his real identity and pieced them together. After they spoke a few times, Ezekiel tried to convince Peter Parker to hide in the specially constructed room, as Morlun was soon to arrive in New York, trying to find the one with the most powerful spider-totem powers. His pleas were in vain, as Parker decided to confront Morlun himself to prevent anyone from dying as a by-product of him not being eaten.[3]\nWithSpider-Manvs.Morlun\nAfter being severely beaten by Morlun, Spider-Man returned and begged use of the room, which Ezekiel revealed would be useless now since Morlun had his scent. He apologized and cursed himself for having to leave the hero to his fate. The next morning, Spider-Man had been severely beaten once more, but was surprised to find Ezekiel save his life.\nIn the fight that followed, Ezekiel fell into the water of the pier and didn't resurface. After defeating Morlun at a power-station, Spider-Man returned to Ezekiel's offices only to discover they were empty. After a little investigation, Spidey noticed footprints on the outside of the windows and a rubber spider - telling the hero that he was still alive.[4]\nNow with a beard\nWhenShathraachieved her goal of pushing Spider-Man to act on instinct, bringing their conflict to the simple level of “natural order” in which the Spider-Wasp is the hunter and the Spider the meal, Spider-Man managed to avoid descending into mindless fury and managed to escape to brief safety. He was helped by Ezekiel, who took Spider-Man to a sacred temple inGhanaand helped Peter to set a trap for Shathra. Spider-Man consciously allowed his arachnid side to take the forefront enough to capture Shathra, and to feed her to whatever spider dwelt in the depths of the temple. Ezekiel also warned Peter that Morlun and Shathra are not the only ones hunting him, and another more powerful foe was coming for him.[6]\nWith Peter Parker\nLater, Ezekiel warned Peter of the coming ofthe Gatekeeper, who controlled mystical forces. Ezekiel said that the Gatekeeper saw him as unworthy to possess his powers, since he received them by accident,and intended to kill him. Ezekiel told Peter to return to Ghana with him, but Peter refused until swarms of spiders attacked New York. Spider-Man tried to save as many as he can when Ezekiel said that the Gatekeeper has arrived to kill him and he urged him to go with him. The spiders gathered to form the body of the Gatekeeper, who told Peter that bugs are important to the world and the spiders are the hunters of the bug-world. Spider-Man attempted to fight the Gatekeeper but he was outmatched. The Gatekeeper tells him that he was chosen bymysticalforcesto receive his powers out of all the students in the demonstration, as he has become a natural hunter because of all the anger he carried in his life when he was bullied, never being able to fight back and reserving the anger to himself, making him never give in to the odds and a hunter because he was the prey. Peter realized that contradicts what Ezekiel had told him, and the Gatekeeper reveals that Ezekiel was unworthy of his powers because he \"stole\" them. Spider-Man awakened battered and bloodied, and Ezekiel explained that because the Gatekeeper will only allow one of them to live, he has to kill Peter. Peter realized that the supernatural menaces he had recently fought were after Ezekiel.[7]\nSacrifice\nEzekiel possessed various superhuman attributes, almost all of them identical to those possessed by Spider-Man.\nSuperhuman Strength:Ezekiel possessed superhuman strength that was just slightly inferior to that of Spider-Man. At his peak, he could lift about 9 tons.\nSuperhuman Speed:Ezekiel could run and move at speeds beyond the physical capabilities of the finest human athlete.\nSuperhuman Stamina:Ezekiel's musculature produced less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a normal human. In spite of his age, he could physically exert himself at peak capacity for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood began to impair him.\nSuperhuman Durability:Ezekiel's body was tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human. For example, Ezekiel could withstand falls or leaps from heights of several stories without sustaining injury. He was also more resistant to great impact forces than a normal human. He could withstand impacts, such as being struck by a superhumanly strong person like Spider-Man, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to show for it.\nSuperhuman Agility:Ezekiel's agility, balance, and bodily coordination were all enhanced to levels that were beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.\nSuperhuman Reflexes:Ezekiel's reflexes were similarly enhanced and were superior to those of the finest human athlete.\nWallcrawling:Like Spider-Man, Ezekiel has the ability to stick to any surface and walk or crawl along them. He could will himself to cling much tighter than normal to surfaces to the point where it's extremely difficult, even for extremely powerful individuals, to pull him away.\nSpider-Sense:Just like Spider-Man, Ezekiel possessed an early warning system that bordered on precognition. It allowed him to detect danger or threats to him within his surrounding area.

After decades in stasis, Jessica awoke in the modern world, with incredible spider-like powers the serum had granted her. Initially trained by Hydra, she rebelled against them and joined S.H.I.E.L.D., where she became a valued asset.\nShe was one of the many superheroes who joinedS.H.I.E.L.D.'s alliance against villains after a mysterious Pulse hit the Earth and left a material calledIsotope-8, desired by both heroes and villains.[1]\nSpider-Woman entered the scene a mission afterWolverinefacedLuke Cageas the new Worthy,Nul. Spider-Woman conversed with Nick Fury prior to battlingBaron Zemo, stating she felt strange \"getting a thank-you note fromViper\" and then conversed Baron Zemo soon after, who greeted her with an idle threat saying \"When is it bad luck to crush a spider?\" She later knocked out Zemo saying that she usually placed bad luck on herformer faction.\nMinutes after the face-off with Zemo, Spider-Woman encountered Viper who was already in the area. Spider-Woman and Viper then engaged in battle, but Viper escaped at the conclusion of the fight. Spider-Woman then escaped herself and worked on a different operation concerning the rise of a new Worthy.[1]\nSpider-Woman was present whenThorwas missing and theCircle of Eightwere scouring San Francisco for the latest Hammerfall. She was working alongsideIron Manto in an operation prevent the uprise of a newWorthy.\nSpider-Woman teamed up with theAgentto deal with cultists guarding a Hammerfall. They were defeated but Spider-Woman remained on the scene, telling Iron Man that she was going to \"check out\" what the cultists were protecting. Despite Iron Man's protests to stay away from hammers, Spider-Woman returned asKuurth.\nSpider-Woman possesses several superhuman powers derived from the genetic experiment that granted her spider-like abilities.\nSuperhuman Strength:Spider-Woman's muscular density and strength have been extraordinarily enhanced and enable her to lift about 7 tons.\nSuperhuman Durability:Spider-Woman's body is somewhat tougher and more resistant to injury than an ordinary human's, although she is far from invulnerable. She is capable of withstanding impact forces that would severely injure or kill an ordinary human with only mild to moderate discomfort.\nSuperhuman Reflexes:Spider-Woman's natural reaction time and reflexes are enhanced to levels beyond the human body's natural limits.\nContaminant Immunity:Spider-Woman's metabolism rapidly creates powerful immunity to all forms of toxins, poisons and drugs. Her body is immune to radiation.\nVenom Blast:Her body possesses an inordinate amount of bio-electricity that she has learned to channel and discharge through her hands, in controlled bursts of what she calls \"Venom Blasts\". These energy projections vary in power; they mostly affect the nervous system in humans. Spider-Woman can regulate them from simply a stun to potent enough to kill an average-sized man in the same way that a lightning bolt could kill him.\nPheromone Secretion:Her metabolism generates certain types of pheromones that can create fear, elicit attraction and/or repulsion on others, depending on unknown factors which might include gender and mood.\nWhen Jessica Drew fell toKuurth, she unintentionally joined theWorthyand gained new powers, alongside her old ones.\nSkilled Martial Artist:Jessica is a highly experienced fighter trained in armed and unarmed combat. Her tactics integrate different methods utilized in Karate, Boxing, Capoeira, Judo and sword-fighting."

While barricaded inside a delivery room without medication, Jessica gave birth to her son Gerald. Upon saying hello and seeing to his immediate well-being, she got off the table, killed every insurgent Skrull before her, and passed out from the pain asCarol Danversarrived a moment after the carnage ended. A few days later, Jessica moved back to her apartment with Gerry, who immediately drove her mad with his crying and sleeplessness. After Jessica's friends took her on a night  out to decompress, babysitterRoger Gocking's attention helped relax him.[2]\nAfter Jessica and Roger's confrontation with Hobgoblin, Gerry's powers manifested as he crawled out of the apartment via the window to the Avengers' roof party, demonstrating his capabilities.[3]As Jess was inSan Franciscofor work, Gerry trashed the apartment beforeKainearrived requesting Jessica's aid. As Gerry played with Roger, he saw Jess leave to fight the Inheritors for his sake and was happy at Jess' return.[4]\nInfant Gerry developing his powers.\nAfter Jess returned from a mission withStrikeforce, Gerry had devastated the apartment by the time she had return and dirtied his way through every diaper in their inventory. After Jess took a job for a new client, later revealed to be his uncleMichael, Roger took Gerry to a farm upstate after Jessica's radiation immunity was erased, posing a health risk to both their safeties.[5]In a video call with Roger, Gerry voiced missing his mom as she continued her quest to cure her condition.[6]After Roger broke up with Jessica for neglecting their relationship,[7]Lindsay McCabestarted looking after Gerry whenever Jessica was busy.[8]Later that job was given to theNight Nurse, but duringMayor Fisk's war on super heroes, hisThunderboltswith assistance ofVerankeattempted to abduct him.[9]Thankfully he was saved by his mother and her friendCaptain Marvel.[10]\nGerry as Green Mamba\nWhen Jessica was brieflysevered from the Web of Life[11]and ceased to exist, not only did memories of her get erased but memories of Gerry ceased to exist as well, with Roger, who was babysitting him at the time, forgetting who Gerry was and left him alone at Jessica's apartment.  However, Gerry's status was picked up byHydraagents, who kidnapped him as part of their program to raise child soldiers with potential gifts whose families had supposedly abandoned. Gerry was rapidly aged into adulthood by being repeatedly placed in an age-acceleration chamber and brainwashed into being one of Hydra's best agents. Jessica was revived[12]while Gerry was undergoing his brainwashing, unlike other child soldiers who had their memories erased, Gerry had his left intact to fuel his hatred towards Jessica, whom he already resented for supposedly prioritizing her super hero career over him and blamed for abandoning him.  Although Jessica's return would have restored other people's memories of Gerry, Hydra used their technical and magical resources to keep his existence suppressed from everyone except Jessica.[13]\nDuring theGang War, Hydra backedDiamondback's campaign to take overNew York's criminal underworld and Gerry volunteered to represent Hydra to get revenge on Jessica, who was dismantling Diamondback's operations, taking the codemaeGreen Mamba.[1][13]Having deduced that Hydra was involved with Gerry's disappearance, Jessica confronted Diamondback at his nightclub where Green Mamba fought her; Jessica failed to recognize Gerry.[14]Jessica attacked one of Hydra's bases inBattery Parkand attempted to stop Diamondback, Green Mamba andViperfrom escaping by helicopter; Green Mamba shot her with a Venom Blast while Viper gloated that she would never see her son again.[15]While Diamondback inquired Viper about Jessica's missing son,Madame Webconfirmed Gerry's existence within the Web of Life to Jessica but an unseen force was obscuring his presence.  Jessica tracked them down to Diamondback's lab at the city's docks and fought him and Green Mamba again.  Jessica believed that Green Mamba was a Hydra foot soldier that was given powers harvested from Gerry's DNA, however Diamondback revealed Green Mamba's identity to her while Gerry unmasked himself.[1]\nGerry revealed the circumstances surrounding his accelerated aging and allegiance to Hydra while blaming his mother for his predicament, who repeatedly tried to convince Gerry he had been brainwashed.  Gerry also revealed that Hydra was only using Diamondback and that the Gang War meant nothing to Viper, who was only entertaining herself to make Jessica's life worse.  This angered Diamondback, which instigated into a three way fight between them.  Diamondback was subdued but Gerry was severely injured.  Gerry refused help from Jessica and allowed himself to fall into theHudson Riverto escape from her.  Jessica was prevented from rescuing him by Captain Marvel, who wasn't aware of Green Mamba's identity.  Jessica didn't tell her or Madame Web what happened, but vowed to make Hydra pay for what they did to her and Gerry.[13]\nAs a toddler, Gerry was shown to be energized and enthusiastic, but also unaware of his destructive potential as a superhuman baby. His playfulness coupled with his already active Spider powers make him a drain on his mother's mental health, but becomes obedient and calm as Roger babysits him.\nGerry crawling the wall outside of his apartment building."

While on a field trip, Cooper saved Peter from being bitten by aradioactive spider, resulting in Cooper being bitten instead and gaining super-human abilities.[5]The two became very close friends since then. On prom night, when Cooper's date stood him up, Peter went as his \"bro date\" so that he wouldn't feel bad. After graduating high school, Cooper picked up on Peter's knack for photography while he was working for the Daily Bugle and encouraged him to pursue it as a long-term career over a field in science, ultimately helping him get a job as a runway fashion photographer.[5][6]\nCooper's already rocky relationship with his homophobic parents was strained further by his need to hide his secret identity, ultimately resulting in them kicking him out of his home. Cooper came to live with his aunts,LaurieandMel Coen. The two encouraged Cooper to follow his passions and put him in New York's best fashion school, which later led to him receiving a job at the premier fashion house,Van Dyne. He then became a superhero under the alias of Web-Weaver, to protect his and his aunts' community.[5]\nCooper worked as Web-Weaver for at least three consecutive years. In his superhero work, he faced off against villains such as Chameleon,[5]Ant-Man, Morbius, Kraven the Hunter, Symbiotes,[1]Rhino, Vulturion,[6]Grizzly, and Kingpin.[7][8]Encounters with Ant-Man and Morbius interrupted his plans to attend Kyle Jinadu's summer birthday parties on Fire Island for two consecutive years, with Kraven the Hunter interfering with the third.[1]\nWhile attending college and/or fashion school, Cooper and Peter began living together as roommates, which they would continue to be after graduating.[5][6]\nWhile working for Van Dyne, Cooper once dated fellow employeeAlbert Moonbefore Moon left Van Dyne to start working for the competitor,Jean-Paul Beaubier, the owner ofNorthstar. This soured their relationship with each other, and Cooper largely still feels bitter about it, but is willing to accept the \"messiness\" of Albert having romantic attraction to his Web-Weaver identity.[5]Unbeknownst to Cooper, Albert also worked as the vigilante superhero Silk. As neither of them knew each other's secret identities, they developed a flirtatious pseudo-romantic relationship and would sometimes work together or cover for each other when the other was unavailable for superhero work.[5][1]\nSpider Physiology[5]"

Then he kept the clone and placed her into a stasis chamber for years.[9]While in stasis, Norman Osborn altered her genetic code to make her the very first human/symbiotehybrid clone, replacing around 35% of her DNA with symbiote genetic matter. This symbiote was derived from pieces of theVenom symbioteand as a result was never sentient so the girl never had to deal with a second consciousness in her mind.\nThis new hybrid was all a part of Osborn's master plan to be reborn into an immortal Goblin Creature. After Osborn's death, a group of theGoblin Cult's followers updated the hybrid's DNA so she would be exactly the same in appearance as May Parker. About 16 years later,Philippe DeJunaediscovered her stasis chamber in a secret lab in Oscorp Chemical, and told his daughterFury the Goblin Queenabout her existence. Planning to use this discovery to her advantage, she decided to lead her would-be partner,Normie Osborn, into \"finding\" the girl.[10]\nThe other May Parker\nPeter Parkerarrived at the lab, and Normie explained that the being in stasis was placed there by his grandfather, and that his grandfather had stated in his notes that the stasis-trapped female was the original May Parker. Peter tried to analyze some of the stasis fluid, but it exploded in his face due to being attacked by Fury, knocking him unconscious. He claimed that it was an attack by the female specimen, but Normie assured Peter that she was not dangerous. Peter and Normie vacated the chamber, but Normie returned when unforeseen activity was heard in the stasis chamber. He rushed down to investigate, but the \"Brand New May\", who was finally awoken by Fury activating a signal from a distance, attacked and overpowered him, allowing herself to escape.[11]\nThe New May stalked the other May at school, and as she rushed out to become Spider-Girl, the New May attacked her. She accidentally threw herself down the school stairwell, allowing the familiar May to escape by leaping off the building. The New May looked fruitlessly for her double as May was driven off by a van she was clinging to. May changed into Spider-Girl to assist theX-Peoplein containingSara Hingle's powers, but New May intercepted her way and tried to tackle her. May saved them both from falling to the street, and, after a brief fight, flung the New May off a building. May saved her double and hung her in a web net on the edge of a building, proving a major difference between the two Mays: Spider-Girl does not kill her enemies, but New May was willing to use lethal force.[12]\nLater an explosion transpired in which May was caught, leaving her in a critical state and to be taken under the care ofArañaandBlack Tarantula. With May gone, the new May took the opportunity to replace her, taking back what she thought should've been her life. She managed to trick May's motherMary Jane, though May's little brotherBenjycould see past her disguise which made him uncomfortable with her. The new May met up with her supposed best friendDavida Kirbyin the Cafe Indigo, but there she was charged byGene Thompsondue to a beef he had with May. New May simply tripped him, and when he charged again, she tossed him effortlessly onto another table. Her peers cheered her victory, butSimonesimply grimaced.\nNew May took to using her spider-powers to do the household chores in record time and in creative ways, such as standing on the ceiling while vacuuming the drapes. Eventually, She got a call fromPhil Urich, who believed her to be the May he knew, to help free her \"father\" from Fury. After pondering whether she was ready, April donned May's spare costume and became the new Spider-Girl. She thoroughly enjoyed being Spider-Girl, swinging through the city. She went to save Peter, only to be met with May in Araña's body. She knocked May out which caused both her and Araña to return to their original bodies. She proceeded to fight the real Araña, who saw her monstrous face before being defeated by the merciless Spider-Girl. The new May went back home, but the house was broken into by the original May and a crazed Peter who was being possessed by Norman's consciousness.[13]\nThe two Mays again fought each other, until Norman used the symbiote hybrid to bond his stolen body with her, becoming the Goblin God. May was also fused in this new body, and was transported to Peter's mindscape. There, she again confronted the hybrid, and as they battled they passed through the memories of Peter and May. Though May defeated her double she managed to convince her that they didn't have to be enemies and she should turn on Norman. The Parkers proved victorious and successfully purged Norman's mind from Peter's, but as he perished Norman refused to tell them which one of the girls was the true May.[14]\nIn the aftermath of the battle in their collective consciousness, the three of them separated and Peter returned to normal. As the new May had no place to go, May proposed to let her join their family since she had always wished to have a sister. Mary Jane agreed, but Peter objected as he was distrustful of her. Despite this, the hybrid was allowed to become a member of the Parker family, and named herself \"April\" as a play-on-words with her \"sister\" May. She then enrolled in the same school as May calling themselves \"cousins.\"[15]\nSpider-Girl Blue andSpider-Girl Red\nThe two Spider-Girls adjusted to life together and investigated the death ofGwen Reilly. Together they worked as partners, helping each other in fighting crime, though April was far more rebellious and ruthless, with May being forced to keep her double in check. However, April's jealousy of May got the better of her stroke out on her own as Mayhem, killingTombstoneand later theHobgoblinwhen she believed that the former killed May.\nApril soon took notice of May growing closer toWes Westinand decided to help their relationship by intermingling between them for a bit. Under the identity of May, she met up with Wes and attempted to kiss him, but he was able to discern that she wasn't actually May. At some point she was hired byMan Mountain Markoto kill Black Tarantula. She would've succeeded in taking him out, hadn't been for the intervention of Spider-Girl and Araña. Eventually, April left the Parker family and cut all ties with them, fully embracing her monstrous side and opting to work alone as a vigilante.[16]\nApril Parker was recruited by theS.H.I.E.L.D.ofEarth-TRN461into theSpider-Men, a group of Spider-Man analogs assembled to combat theMultiversal Sinister Six.[9]\nAmong theSpider-Men\nKraven the Hunterhunted Mayhem to his lair inCentral Park. The nativePeter Parkercame to her aid and while she was able to escape, he was captured. April went AWOL, but was found byBen Reilly. Mayhem joined theSymbiote Hiveand with the help ofAgony, they built an army and rescued Peter. Afterwards, Ben became an honorary uncle for April.[9]\nPoisontricked April into bonding with theScream Symbioteunder the pretense of saving thesymbiotesfrom extinction. April was able to resist the symbiote enough for Poison andToxinto give up. Bonding to theRaze Symbiote, April gained the strength to separate Ben from theCarnage Symbioteand Eddie Brock from theToxin Symbiote. Afterwards, a weakened Scream bonded to Eddie Brock, becoming the Hive's brood mother when she returned to full strength.[9]\nApril also joined theElite Counter-Symbiote Squadto capture rogue symbiotes. Among the symbiotes they deported toKlyntarwasPork Grind.[9]She later returned to her reality.\nStill under the belief she was the real May, April attempted to threaten May into retiring as Spider-Girl and admitting she was the clone, sparking a fight between them. In one future, May died when the warehouse they were fighting in exploded. In order to preventthat future where clones of the Carnage symbiote were conquering the world, theApril from that timelinetravelled back in time, and transferred her memories to her younger self."

One day, she would find out that thePower familywas secretly thePower Packand witnessed her father use his powers to rescue them.[9]\nAnnie Parker\nWhenKraven the Hunterrealized Spider-Man was fighting like a scared father, Regent called in all families connected toPublic School 122 Mamie Fayfor a power screening. Despite passing, thanks to herInhibitor Chip, a fellow classmate,Lewis, was outed as amutant. With her father abandoning them to save Lewis,Mysteriowas able to locate Annie and her mother. Luckily, however,S.H.I.E.L.D.found them first.[10]\nReunited with the Power Pack, Annie was given a costume to go along with her powers, much to her mother's dismay. Suddenly, theSinister Sixinvade the base. As they were escaping, Annie turned back and quickly subduedBoomerang,Rhino,Shocker, and Kraven. This convinced her mother to turn back and, together, rescue her father.[11]\nAnnie joins the fight\nInvadingEmpire Unlimited's headquarters, Annie quickly dispatchedDr.Shannon Stillwell, despite the villain's superior strength. She started removing Regent's connection to the heroes' stasis cells, effectively depleting his powers. When Regent arrived to stop them, Annie's father broke free of his imprisonment and tackled Regent out the window. AMP, her new code name, jumped out the window and used an Inhibitor Chip-infusedTrick Arrowto depower Regent; however, even with his powers neutralized, the Regent was still a threat. Peter, Annie, and MJ teamed up to beat him up, but the Regent got hold of Annie. Peter bluffed his way next to the Regent, and made a joke that caused the villain to laugh and be distracted for long enough so Peter could strike a finishing blow that knocked him out, though he had initially intended to deal a killing blow. S.H.I.E.L.D. proceeded to take the Regent into custody using an improvised restraining unit created by theProwler. With the Regent neutralized, Peter, MJ, and Annie resumed their normal lives.[3]\nAMP was recruited by theS.H.I.E.L.D.ofEarth-TRN461into theSpider-Men, a group of Spider-Man analogs, to help battle theMultiversal Sinister Six. She also became a member of theSpider-Force. During this time, she was taken in by the nativePeter ParkerandMary Jane Watsonand was even enrolled in school.\nAmong theSpider-Men\nPeter attempted to help her create a suit to protect MJ; however, all imports into New York City were blocked due to the Sinister Six's invasion. Annie informed them of the powersuit her mother used to help fight Reagent, which Peter then promptly took from Earth-18119's Empire Unlimited. On her way to school, Annie was seemingly attacked by her reality's Venom. Overcoming her fear, she discovered he was an illusion conjured by an alternateMysterio. She came to considerSpider-Ma'amandAnti-Venomher honorary great-aunt and uncle, respectfully. Annie was later joined by her mother, who used a newsuitto become the super hero Spinneret.[12]\nShortly after Peter Parker took up being Spider-Man once more,Mole Manattacked the ruins ofEmpire Unlimited Headquarters. As Peter and MJ faced the threat, Annie’s premonitions showed her parents fightingMoloids, so she suited up to join the fight.[13]Shortly thereafter she was captured,[1]though she was quickly rescued by her parents.[14]While Peter and MJ argued about their daughter being in danger as a superhero, Annie slipped away to confront the villain herself.[13]The Parkers defeated Mole-Man and his army soon after, and Anna-May was dubbed ‘Spiderling’ by her father following the success.[2]\nAsSpiderling\nLater, during Peter’s birthday party atMJ'sinSoHo, the Parkers were approached byProfessor X, who showed interest in Anna-May as a possible student atXavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Annie toured the school withJubileeandShine. While arguing with Jubilee, Annie was struck by a premonition which showed her parents and theX-Mengetting attacked in theDanger Room. At that moment, theBrotherhood of Evil Mutantsstruck on the school grounds. Annie and Katie were taken intoCerebrobyMagneto, where it was revealed that Jubilee had betrayed the X-Men.[15]Annie grew increasingly furious with Jubilee, upsetting Kate, who used her powers to cause a distraction, allowing both of them to escape. Anna-May later attacked Jubilee upon seeing her ambush the X-Men. Spiderling and her parents went to confront Magneto andEmma Frost; Spinneret took down both. With the villains apprehended, Peter and MJ concluded that they would talk about allowing Annie to attend the school.[16]\nBefore turning 16, Annie would get approached byMiguel O'HaraofEarth-928B, a futuristic universe in the year 2099, to join his Strike Force to protect theMultiversealongside her mother.\nThe Parkers pursuedRhino, however Spiderling was forced to stay behind. Spider-Man and Spinneret became incapacitated, and Annie rushed in to help. As a result, she was kidnapped by the Rhino and his masked goons. Annie wakes up to find herself imprisoned in Oscorp, withNormie Osborn. The two bicker, with Normie revealing how lonely he was and Annie sympathizing with him. She told him that killing Spider-Man wouldn't make him happy, and offered him her friendship.[17]While theGoblin Mechattacked the city, Spinneret rescued Annie, with the help ofLiz Allan. They find Normie injured, stating that he attempted to stop the mech. He informed them thatMs. Januarywas piloting the Goblin Armor. Spiderling was guided by Normie throughout the mech, where she ultimately destroyed the armor. Later, Normie thanked Spiderling and the two become friends.[18]\nWhen the spider hunters known as theInheritorsused clone bodies to escape their imprisonment, Annie was visited bySpider-GirlandSpider-Woman, heroes fromalternateearths, at the same time she started having visions of the future threats. After learning with her parents the threat that the Inheritors represented, Annie realized that she could feel the scrolls Spider-Girl brought to their reality, which meant that she was connected to theWeb of Life and Destiny. While her parents joined theSpider-Armyto fight the Inheritors, Annie was left under the care of Anya and Mayday Parker, the alternate version of herstillborn sister.[19]\nAs a member of theSpider-Army\nThe three spider-heroes managed to cure the six-armed Normie Osborn from Annie's reality while fightingBoraandBrix. After Annie managed to successfully connect to the Great Web, Anya and Mayday realized that she was a newSpider-Totemknown as The Patternmaker.[20]Annie then opened a portal to reunited with the rest of the Spider-Army and defeat the Inheritors, that were later turned into babies.[21]\nWhile repairing the Great Web, Annie discovered a section that was corrupted and dissolved into viscous red ooze when she touched it. Sensing that the entity responsible for the corruption,Carnage, would endanger the Multiverse if left unchecked, Anne's Spider-Sense led her toJon Shayde- an NYPD detective fromEarth-616who had been infected by an offshoot of the Carnage symbiote. Pulling him into the ruins of Loomworld, Annie introduced herself as the Patternmaker and gave him a quick overview of the Web of Life before sending him toNiffleheim.[22]\nContinuing her repairs, Annie accidentally unleashed the dark wasp-goddessShathra,[4]who had been trapped in the Primal Strand of the Web of Life following the death of her physical form at the fangs ofthe Other.[23]Intent on slaughtering the Spider-Totems, destroying the Great Web, and replacing it with her Great Nest, Shathra stung Annie — her venom converting her from a Spider-Totem avatar into a Wasp-Totem avatar that Shathra dubbed the Nestling.[4]\nSpider Physiology:"

The three then purposely fell into a trap set by the spider-powered heroes, in order to transform them into different monsters: Using theMan-Wolf'sgemstone,King Spiderwas turned into awerewolf; usingMorbius' serum,Captain Marvelwas turned into avampire; and using theLizardserum,Spider-Hulkwas turned into aLizard-like creature.[1]In preparation for Carol's transformation into a vampire, Jess had organized blood donations from members of the Resistance, ensuring that she would not be overwhelmed by bloodlust.[2]\nJess took part in the assault onThe Queen's Castle.

She was raised by her father due to the death of her mother sometime in her childhood. Their family was close friends with their neighbors, the Parkers, who they often shared dinner with. Gwen consideredPeter Parkerher best friend during that time. She'd attend Chelsea Visions Academy with Peter and befriended the members ofEm Jay Watson's bandThe Mary Janes, becoming their drummer. She would train in ballet and joined the gymnastics team at Visions.[2]After being bitten by aRadioactive Spiderwhen she was twelve years old,[verification needed]Gwen was granted arachnid-like super-powers and began a career as a crime-fighter. Making an outfit and web-shooters, she was dubbed by the media as \"Spider-Woman.\" Her father did not approve of the vigilante although he had been saved by Spider-Woman on at least one occasion,[1]while Peter found her cool and looked up to her as a sort of idol. While in costume, Gwen would talk in a lower register to hide her identity.[2]\nAt the dance\nSpider-Woman's influence caused one of the biggest tragedies in Gwen's life. The bullied Peter Parker, desperate to be special like his idol Spider-Woman in order to defend himself from his bullies, conducted an experiment that turned him into aLizard-like creatureand caused him to lose control. Gwen arrived at the Chelsea Visions Academy Homecoming Dance and looked for Peter only to find a giant lizard version of Peter attempting to attack his bullyNed. Suiting up as Spider-Woman, Gwen engaged in a confrontation with the beast. Not knowing that it was Peter, she carelessly kicked the Lizard with all her strength into the ballroom's main pillar, ripping it out of its mountings and causing the entire structure to crash on top of him, followed by the collapse of the entire ceiling. Gwen rushed to the body of the Lizard only to find it to be a fatally wounded Peter.[2]\nDeath of Peter\nBefore dying, Peter told Gwen that he had wanted to be special like her, revealing to Gwen that he had known she was Spider-Woman much to her shock and dismay. Gwen held Peter's dead body as she sobbed into it before swinging away upon realizing that her father had arrived on the scene. Seeing Spider-Woman escape after holding the dead body of his daughter's best friend, Captain Stacy blamed the vigilante for his death and started a manhunt on her. In addition to the manhunt, Spider-Woman was blamed by the media for Peter's death and branded as a criminal. Although facing constant scrutiny from the press and an active manhunt, Spider-Woman would still defend the city from various villains including theVultureandDoctor Octopus. During this time period, Gwen would isolate herself from other people as much as she could, fearing that anyone getting close to her might die because of the Spider Woman side and also to prevent going through the grief and guilt of losing another friend.[2]\nUndercover at Brooklyn Visions\nOne day while fightingDoctor Octopus, Gwen was suddenly pulled into a portal and transported back a week into analternate reality. Realizing her situation, Gwen went undercover and followed her Spider-Sense which had told her to find Miles Morales by going to theBrooklyn Visions Academy. Posing as one of the students, she first encounteredMiles Moralesin physics class after he sat next to her due to her being the only person who had laughed at his Einstein joke. Later, Gwen would intentionally bump into Miles who would immediately try to hit on her while sweating intensely. He introduced himself and she clumsily introduced herself to as \"Gwanda\" in the event that there was another Gwen Stacy in Miles' reality. Miles's own budding spider-powers caused problems when he accidentally stuck his hand to her hair when trying to hit on her with the infamous shoulder touch, forcing her to have it shaved off by the school nurse leaving a giant handprint in her hair. She would briefly see Miles as he walked on the side of a building getting acclimated to his new abilities.[1]\nUndercover at Alchemax\nSometime after the incident at Brooklyn Visions Academy, Gwen would get a proper haircut to get the handprint shaved out of her hair transforming into an undercut. Gwen followed a lead toAlchemaxfacility at the Hudson Valley, where she likewise went undercover as a staff member. There she ran into Miles Morales again as he andPeter B. Parkerwere being chased byOlivia Octavius. Miles was too busy running to recognize Gwen in her disguise, but she quickly changed into the Spider-Woman costume and came to their rescue, retrieving Doc Ock's computer from her hands and webbing her to a tree. She then unmasked herself to Miles and Peter and gave them a recap of her origin story. The Spiders then swung away, and on their bus ride back to New York Miles and Gwen bonded together. Gwen would take a selfie with Miles on the bus ride, the photo being the only one she would have of her newfound friend.[1]\nIn dead Peter's Spider-Lair\nThe three made their way to house ofAunt May, whose nephewPeter Parkerhad died just a few days ago. May welcomes them into Peter's underground Spider-Lair, where they meet three more interdimensional travellers: private-eyeSpider-Man Noir, a Japanese teenager with arobot suitnamedPeni Parker, and the cartoon-logic-wielding anthropomorphic pigSpider-Ham. Realizing that their only way back home was throughKingpin's supercollider, each of them offered to stay behind and destroy it, only for Miles to point out that they would then die in his dimension. Gwen and the Spiders pressed upon him to test his skills and found them lacking, causing Miles to leave.[1]\nAt Aunt May's House\nPeni constructs a new goober to deactivate the Super-Collider, when Miles rushed back in, unintentionally exposing their location.Doc Ock,Tombstone,ScorpionandProwlerarrives to take the goober, resulting in a big fight that left Aunt May's house destroyed. Miles discovered that the Prowler was his uncle Aaron, and loses him at the hands of the Kingpin. The Spiders later went to Miles' dorm room at theBrooklyn Visions Academyto say goodbye, as Peter would not allow him to come with them. Consoling Miles over the loss of his uncle, Gwen told him that they like no others could understand what he was going through, having lost her best friend Peter in a similar way.[1]\nSupercollider fight\nLeaving Miles behind, the other five Spiders went toFisk Tower, infiltrating a memorial service of lateSpider-Manby posing as waiters and gaining access to the supercollider room. However their position was exposed, and a massive fight erupted between them and the Kingpin's enforcers. Suffering from the glitching effects, the Spider-People were nearly beaten in battle, but as the collider was activated, Miles returned with a brand-new suit and better control over his powers, saving them and helping them beat back Kingpin's forces. As the supercollider's portal grew unstable, the team inserted the goober and one by one went back to their universe. Gwen accepted Miles as a friend, the only one she had made after Peter died, before going home.[1]At this moment in time, Gwen had wanted to kiss Miles but ultimately did not do it, which she would come to regret.[2]\nQuitting the band\nUnable to talk to Miles or to travel to his universe, Gwen was still left on her own to deal with everything going on in both of her lives. Her crush on Miles would grow everyday as she desired to see him again, keeping the undercut hairstyle she had gotten as a result of him in an attempt to remember him. At some point, Gwen would undergo a \"canon event\" which involved her getting buried alive, and crawling out of her own grave.\nAround a year after her first interdimensional adventure, she exploded in anger at the attempts of herMary Janesband members to get her to open up, causing her to completely quit the band. When she got back home, her father tried to talk to her about his job, but the topic led to the Spider-Woman case which upset Gwen. George then asked his daughter to hug her, but as she did he was called up to respond to aVulturewreaking havoc at theGuggenheim Museum. Gwen followed the same call as Spider-Woman and webbed Captain Stacy andYuri Watanabeto her dad's car. After taunting him and webbing his mouth, Spider-Woman rushed inside.[2]\nBattling the Vulture\nShe called for Vulture, only to find that it was notthe one from her world, but adifferent versionfrom aLeonardo da Vincireality who fell through a dimensional portal. She tried to subdue him, but Vulture was too strong and nearly got the best of her until another dimensional portal opened andanother Spider-Manrushed through to join the fight. He introduced himself asMiguel O'Harafromanother reality, but Gwen was fixated on hiswatchwhich she quickly deduced allowed him to easily travel between realities. O'Hara was also still angry at her for the incident at Kingpin's supercollider: instead of closing the hole in theMultiverselike they thought, they left it wide open for Anomalies like this Vulture to regularly cross through.[2]\nHelicopter rescue\nVulture attacked again and proved a match for O'Hara as well, causing him to call for backup. A motorcycle-ridingSpider-Womanarrived from another portal, immediately leaving an impression on Gwen. Captain Stacy led a group of cops inside, but Gwen webbed him up once again. The Vulture escaped through the roof, where Miguel took away his wings, but not before the Vulture downed a police helicopter. As it was about to crash on top of civilians which included her dad, Gwen in a split-second concocted a plan, made a web for the chopper to land onto, dodged its propeller blade and roped up a web to slow its descent. Miguel and the new Spider-Woman joined in as well, getting the pilots out and stopping the falling chopper just in time.[2]\nUnmasked\nGwen earned their respect with this and the issue had been dealt with. Captain Stacy seeing an opening surprised Spider-Woman and held her at gunpoint, ordering her to surrender. Gwen immediately realized that she was out of web-fluid and attempted to reason with her father only for him to fire a warning shot in the air. Not having any other options, Gwen removed her mask and tried to explain herself and the fact that Peter's death was an accident. Unfortunately for her, George was caught up in the fact that his daughter had been lying to him for something this serious for so long and couldn't see past his views on the vigilante. He started reading her her Miranda rights as Gwen pleaded as she began to break down in to tears. Before he was able to do anything, Captain Stacy was immediately disarmed and trapped in a force cage by Miguel. O'Hara threw the captured Vulture into a dimensional portal, and Spider-Woman asked him to take Gwen with them. After a brief consideration Miguel tossed the tearful Gwen aDimensional Travel Watch, inviting her to come with him. Gwen shared a last look at her dad before going through the portal.[2]\n\"Goodbye, dad\"\nGwen joined Miguel'sSpider Societybased onEarth-928and was tasked with protecting the Multiverse from further disruptions. The Spider-Woman Jessica Drew became her mentor, and Gwen made friends among other Spiders such asPavitr Prabhakarand especiallyHobie Brownwho became a big brother figure for her. As Gwen could not return home so she would often crash in Hobie's apartment, where she kept a jumper and a toothbrush. She, Hobie and others did twenty missions to other dimensions while hunting for Anomalies, including one in a Shakespeare dimension as well as capturing a variant of theProwler. She also became the drummer in his band. She was also reunited withPeniandPeter B. Parkerbut they were forbidden to ever visit Miles or his universe as Miguel believed Miles to be the original multiversal anomaly who despite not knowing it was the reason behind the current destabilization of theMultiverse. In addition to learning this, Gwen would also learn about the fates of her variants across the Multiverse and how their relationships with Spider-Man usually ended up in misery. She'd allow her hairstyle to grow but would maintain it in the undercut style as a tribute to Miles but would dye the ends pink. She'd also begin wearing teal chucks instead of her pointe shoes with her suit and added long, fingerless pink gloves with spider web patterning to her suit as well.[2]\nVisiting Miles\nA few months after Gwen joined in,a new Anomalywas spotted that originated on Miles' homeEarth-1610. Gwen was assigned to deal with the anomaly, but was forbidden from visiting Miles. Disobeying Jess and Miguel's orders, she opened a portal and landed shoes first onto Miles' bed and hugged him as soon as she could. She awkwardly messed around with him in his room, taking an action collectible out of it's packaging and looking through Miles's sketchbook which was filled with drawings of her. After convincing Miles to swing around the city with her despite him being grounded, Gwen fell back behind a building to plant a spider tracker in order to keep watch on the anomaly. They both together stopped a robber and grabbed some food from a street vendor. Gwen told Miles all about the Spider Society and the new companions she had met but was barred from telling him the truth of his origins. As a result, when Miles asked how he could join the Spider Society, Gwen had to let him down and lie, saying that the team was just a \"small strike force.\"[2]\n\"There's a first time for everything, right?\"\nMiles eventually took Gwen to his favorite spot in the city, the Williamsburg Bank Building, where the two shared a tender moment. Gwen commented on how Miles was her only true friend, with him adding that their friendship was special because they were the same \"in the important ways\". Gwen began talking about how in the other multiverses, nearly every version of herself ends up falling forSpider-Man. Miles moved his hand closer to hers but stopped after she added that the relationship often doesn't end well. Still, he reassured her, letting her know that there's always a \"first time for everything\" causing her to smile, and they shared a quiet bonding moment together as she rested her shoulder on his.[2]\nMeeting the parents\nThey then arrived at the rooftop party at Miles' house, where Gwen and Miles ate food while Miles attempted to play with Gwen's portal watch much to her dismay. Just as Gwen and Miles were getting closer his parents interrupted them and Gwen was awkwardly introduced to his parentsJeffandRio. Her tracker then indicated activity in The Spot's location and forced her to bid an awkward goodbye to Miles. She arrived to the site too late, finding evidence of an explosion and the police already on the scene. Sneaking inside, she reviewed the tracker's footage and learned thatSpotharnessed enough energy to jump into another reality. Noticing her failure, Jess pressed Gwen into confessing that she went to see Miles, escalating her situation even further.LYLAtracked Spot toEarth-50101and Gwen went there to fix things, saying goodbye to Miles and promising never to visit him again not knowing that an invisible Miles was looking right at her.[2]\nAttacking Spot\nOn Earth-50101 however she found that Miles had followed her while invisible. Gwen tried to feign annoyance at him for following her despite the fact that she still very much wished she could have stayed longer in his universe. They metPavitrwho instantly sensed romantic tension between the two, and the three of them engaged Spot together. Spot soon located this reality'sAlchemax, went inside to commandeer their supercollider and locked himself behind the force field. Gwen, Pavitr and Miles were unable to break through untilHobiearrived to reinforce them and used the power of rock to break the shield. Gwen introduced Hobie and Miles, but the four of them were unable to stop the Spot from jumping into the supercollider.[2]\nMumbattan teamwork\nEmerging far more powerful, Spot departed Earth-50101, as the explosion of the supercollider caused the section of theAlchemax Buildingto collapse onto the streets. The Spiders jumped in, with Pavitr and Miles clearing the civilians while Hobie and Gwen were trying to slow the falling debris. Gwen was informed by LYLA about an upcoming Canon Event involvingInspector Singhand attempted to stop Miles from saving him, but was unsuccessful. Miles jumped in and saved Inspector Singh, ending the incident with no civilian casualties. The entire crowd applauded the four Spider-People and Gwen admitted to Miles that she found him amazing, when a dimensional rift began to grow underneath them. Jess Drew arrived with a team of Spiders to contain it and ordered everyone except Pavitr to report to the HQ.[2]\nAnswering to Miguel\nHobie, Miles and Gwen traveled toSpider SocietyHQ onEarth-928, and Gwen showed Miles around, while still keeping from him his role in what was playing out. The trio would bump intoMargo Kesswho would show them the Go-Home Machine in action. Miles trying to get back at Gwen for falsely thinking that she had done things with Hobie would hit on Margo and Gwen would tug him away with a web feeling jealousy. They got to the office of Miguel, who erupted in anger at both of them. To explain to Miles what he had done, Miguel had LYLA show a holographic presentation explaining theMultiverse, theWeb of Life and Destinyand Canon Events, revealing that deaths of PoliceCaptain Stacyor similar figures could not be avoided without threatening the fabric of reality, something that applied to Gwen's father as well. Miles realized that his father was about to become Captain, and Miguel confirmed thatJeffwas about to die in two days and Miles was not allowed to save him.[2]\nCatching Miles\nPeter and Gwen tried to talk to Miles and angrily Miles would tell Gwen that she should have never come to see him as she began to tear up. Miguel's harsh approach had alienated him and caused him to run after breaking out of his confines with some help from Hobie, with the entire Spider Society chasing after him. Gwen was visibly confused about if she was doing the right thing but Jess would encourage Gwen to use her head. A tearful Gwen caught Miles by a web strand, but he angrily tore it apart as he continued to evade capture. Eventually, Miguel caught up with Miles and revealed the truth about Miles' status as the original Anomaly, shattering Miles' faith in Gwen and Peter for keeping it from him. After saying goodbye to Gwen, Miles escaped and used the Spider Society'sGo Home Machineto transport himself back to his home dimension. Unfortunately, it locked onto his spider's DNA and sent Miles toEarth-42instead.[2]\nForcibly sent home\nWith Miles gone, Gwen and Peter tried to talk to Miguel, but he exploded at Gwen and sent her home with theGo Home Machineas well, disabling herDimensional Travel Watchand calling her friendship with Miles a liability. Back onEarth-65, Gwen went back to her apartment only to grab her only picture with Miles, but her father woke up and asked her to at least look at him. Gwen remarked that he looked skinny, and George asked where she had been, with Gwen sarcastically replying that she was out murdering all her friends. Taking it as a sign that she wasn't willing to talk, her father then dismissed it and simply went into another room. Realizing she messed up, Gwen then went after him and tried to open up the conversation, eventually going into a tirade about how her mask was the same as his badge and that she had to do the things she had to do, despite not knowing how. Midway through her speech, George revealed that he decided to quit the force, as his job and title held no meaning to him next to his daughter. He called her the best thing he had ever done, and Gwen embraced him in a warm hug. George then surprised Gwen by giving her a present thatHobieleft with him earlier. It contained anotherDimensional Travel Watch, and Gwen once again stepped through a portal into another universe, only this time promising her dad to come back home soon.[2]\n\"You're the best thing I've ever done\"\nInstantly hugging Miles after seeing him for the first time in over a year.\nInside of Gwen's drum set displaying the note from her deceased mother."

However, as Spider-Man was fightingSandman, the V-252 bonded with him, making him aggressive and ruthless. Unbeknownst to her, Peter bonded with the V-252 as he was Spider-Man. She, along with her other classmates were devastated when the V-252 went missing, though, Peter tried to cheer them up.[8]Later on, she was still devastated when the V-252 went the missing, but cheered up when Peter returned the lifeform toMax Modell.[9]\nLater, Gwen attending the Stark Expo with fellow students, Anya, Gwen, Peter, Max, and science teacher,Dr. Otto Octavius. Later on, in the event, their respective creations, with the exception of the V-252 went haywire asGhostsabotaged them leading toIron Manand Spider-Man stopping him, via the V-252. After it was revealed that the V-252 was sentient and alive, Max abandoned all research on it, believing it to be dangerous.[10]\nLater, when Miles was bitten by the Electris Arachnis spider, he revealed his secret identity asSpider-Manto Gwen and Anya, who dismissed that Spider-Man kept a secret identity to Peter.[11]\nLater, whenNorman Osbornhunted down Spider-Man and Miles usingKraven the Hunter, Gwen, along with Anya and Max (who was oblivious that Miles was the second incarnation of Spider-Man).[12]\nLater, Gwen attended Horizon High's Costume Party as the Red Riding Hood. She also attending with Harry, who was waiting for Peter. Later, the school was attacked whenMan-Wolfattacked the school. He was stopped by the team of Gwen, Spider-Man, Harry, and AvengerHulk.[13]\nShe also helped Peter unlock information from a pen drive which belonged toHamnerhead.[14]\nSometime later, after Otto was attacked byCrimson Dynamo, she was the only one, along with Peter, to believe that Otto could redeem himself by going after Galina, which he and Spider-Man did, confirming Gwen's status.[15]\nLater, she was dismal when Otto was dismissed by Max as a result ofThe Lizard's attack on Horizon High.[16]She got to stay out of school for about a week due to repairs.[17]\nLater, Gwen was upset when it was revealed that Spider-Man and Miles apparently killed her \"uncle\",\"Raymond Warren\", but Peter reassured her that Spider-Man and Miles were innocent and that \"Raymond\" was a clone. Later, she, Peter, and Gwen discovered a secret lab underneathMidtown High Schoolwhere they were clones of Raymond and he kept the spiders for experimentation. At that moment, the real Raymond arrived with theSinister Fivemembers, which included Otto, Aleksei, former teacher,Adrian Toomes,Ollie Osnick, andAlistair Smythewho were mind-controlled by Otto and Raymond to do their bidding. This resulted in Gwen and the rest being exposed to the spiders, giving them superpowers and the destruction of Midtown High, and the apparent death and defeat of Norman Osborn.[18]\nLater, Gwen became a new superhero known as Spider-Gwen and with Spider-Man, Miles, and a reluctant Harry's help, stopped the threat of Stealth Spider (who actually was Norman having mutated as a result of the destruction of Midtown High). Also, in the process, it was revealed that multiple people in New York were exposed to the \"Spider-Virus\" and were spider-powered.[2]Later, she and Spider-Man helped AvengerBlack WidowstopCrossbonesandDr. Arnim Zolafrom taking over the world with their organization,Hydra. As she was autographing her fans, Gwen turned into a monstrous spider-like creature sending her last phone calls to Anya and Peter.[19]Later, Anya and Peter discovered she was a spider-like monster, and with the help of Harry kept her and Norman safe from Kraven who was using New York as his hunting grounds for his show.[20]Later, during the curing of New York City, Gwen, along with millions of others, was cured of the Spider-Virus. Sometime later, Anya let Gwen know (as she is her best friend) that she wasSpider-Girl.[21]\nLater, when Otto was defeated by Hobgoblin and Spider-Man, she, Miles, and Anya saved Spider-Man after he was attacked by Hobgoblin.[22]\nWhen she, Peter, Anya, and Miles, were let out of Horizon for summer, she attended theRoss Calibanwith Anya and later went on a camping trip with the latter three. During the camping trip, she reminded Peter that summer is supposed to be fun.[23]\nWhen Otto returned to Horizon to resume his position as science teacher, he saved Gwen when Miles and Peter programmed the security bots to attack Otto so they wouldn't have to change. To everybody's surprise, Otto saved Gwen. Gwen gave Otto a second chance into his heart and was relieved when both: Aleksei was cured of being Rhino and Otto resumed his position as science teacher.[24]\nShe also worked with the Neuro-Cortex with Otto, Miles, and Anya, where it was discovered that Otto was using them as petty revenge against Spider-Man.[25]\nVenomized Gwen\nAs time went on, Gwen, Miles and Anya started thinking about life after Horizon High, and began looking into colleges. When the Avengers broughtKlyntar symbiotesback from a space mission with theGuardians of the Galaxy, the city soon became engulfed in madness as the infection spread. Gwen, Miles and Anya came to assist Peter after he was attacked by Venomized versions ofCaptain America,Iron Man,Captain Marvel,Thor,Hulk,Baby Groot,CloakandDaggerwhile trying to get into Horizon High to stop the invasion. The young heroes fought valiantly, but were overpowered byDoctor Strangeand subsequently infected by Ironheart. Now bonded to symbiotes, Gwen and the others attacked Peter. They were later freed after Max and Peter were able to create theAnti-Venom Symbiotefor Baby Groot, which wiped out the symbiote infection throughout the city.[3]"

She became Patient Zero's willing test subject, and was injected with genetic samples of Deadpool and Spider-Man in order to mutate her body.[3]Following the procedure, she was given the name of Susan Mary.[1]\nShe was first let loose inWall Streetduring a fight between Spider-Man, Deadpool and theHateful Hexad. Susan Mary interrupted the battle and killed the Hateful Hexad's membersBearboarguy,Gibbon, andOxwhile singing the nursery rhymeItsy Bitsy Spider, and left the scene after teasing the two heroes.[4]The song she sang prompted Spider-Man to nickname her \"Itsy Bitsy.\"\nItsy Bitsy disagreed with Patient Zero's plans, who wanted her to kill Spider-Man and Deadpool, while she wanted to join forces with them and together violently combat crime. Patient Zero escaped from Itsy Bitsy and sought Spider-Man and Deadpool's help when he was lured to their hideout. Itsy Bitsy abruptly killed Patient Zero, and was confronted by Spider-Man and Deadpool as she tried to convince them she was on their side, but they rejected her violent methods (during this time, Deadpool had been convinced by Spider-Man to abandon killing). Itsy Bitsy eventually realized she couldn't make them see her way, and actively tried to kill them. In an attempt to kill Itsy Bitsy, Deadpool blew up hisDead-Buggy, which was charged with explosives. Itsy Bitsy emerged from the wreckage, healed from her injuries, and carried on with her plan to get rid of crime.[1]\nOn top of her relentlessness and extreme methods, Itsy Bitsy's decision to kill in Deadpool and Spider-Man's names made the latter genuinely consider resorting to killing in order to put an end to her murdering rampages.[5]Spider-Man lured Itsy Bitsy to a pier where he intended to disintegrate her with a plasma breeder, and almost succeeded, atomizing her lower body. Deadpool interrupted Spider-Man's attempt to finish his mission in order to prevent him from crossing the line.[2]While Spider-Man and Deadpool battled, Itsy Bitsy regenerated enough body mass to get back in the fight. However, Spider-Man quickly knocked her down and prepared to push her through the plasma breeder for a final time. Deadpool decided to sacrifice all of the progress he made in trying to give up on killing, and distracted Spider-Man with a flash bang before taking Itsy Bitsy and pushing her through the plasma breeder, seemingly killing her.\nGenetically Enhanced Physiology:Patient Zero's procedure granted Itsy Bitsy the combined abilities of Spider-Man and Deadpool, and some other extra powers.[1]\nDual Swords:Similarly to Deadpool, Itsy Bitsy employs a pair of swords for combat.[1]"

However, she pushed her powers too far and the radiation almost killed her.[2]In 2051 A.D., the survivors still living in an underground facility located underNew York Citycame under attack from mutated radioactive monster who was no match even for their combined powers and had killed several of them.\nLacking any other way to deal with it the survivors, at the great risk to them, managed to contactCaptain Marvelwho was in deep space and believed that everyone on Earth had died. Overjoyed to find some of her friends and their children still alive, Carol was able to come up with a way for her and the others to defeat and kill the creature. After having a warm reunion and spending time with Jessica, Carol then learned about what prevented the resettling of the Earth's surface and sacrificed herself to save the humanity by restarting the Sun and making the surface habitable again.[1]"

The unlife destroyed Terrex and killed Broderick and the illusion ended together with the threat over Moondragon.[9]\nSince then, Angar used his power for personal gain, and his schemes brought him in conflict withIron Fist. Angar attacked Iron Fist withKhumbala Bey, however Iron Fist defeated them both. Stopped before he could kill Angar by Scarfe, Iron Fist found a clue on Angar's body that could lead them toColleen Wing, who had been kidnapped byMaster Khan: A Stark Enterprises identification card.[1][10]\nAngar used his powers to brainwash Colleen into believing she had to kill Iron Fist.[11]Having tracked her toEngland, Iron Fist was attacked by Colleen and even though he managed to free her from Angar's influence, he was captured by Khan's men, who were prepared to execute Iron Fist right on the spot.[12]Iron Fist and Colleen fought Angar's brainwashed soldiers. Colleen dealt with Angar using a crippling blow by slicing him across the stomach with her samurai sword. Master Khan was later drawn into a imploding rift and disappeared.[13]\nSpider-Woman (Jessica Drew)andLindsay McCabewitnessed the police hassling the Angar. When prompted to show some ID, he simply screamed.[14]The hallucinogenic scream, affected everyone on the beach including Jessica and Lindsay. After the effects have wore off, and Angar fled, only Jessica remembered the incident.Scotty McDowelladvised Jessica that Angar had a bounty put on his head by the Halwan and he needed her to capture him. Angar had taken up shop in Star Land, an amusement park that was also a secret hideout for mob figures whom he was in the employ of. Returning to the office following his walk on the beach, he was scolded by his employers. Deciding to cover his tracks, Angar used his screaming powers to make them forget he was there as well, then decided to wait for his benefactors to call him for his next job. Following a lead that took her to Star Land, she is attacked once more by Angar who unleashed a full-power scream on her. Haunted with hallucinations of every foe she had battled, Spider-Woman managed to fight off the illusions and sent Angar on the run. When Angar tried to scream again, Jessica exploded a bag of cement in his face, causing the powder to make him cough and unable to scream. The furious heroine then beat Angar into submission and told him to stay put until the police arrived or she will cut loose on him again. When Angar tried to scream once more, Spider-Woman informed him that she had become immune to his scream and proceeded to beat him again.[15]\nSometime later,Locksmithbegan kidnaping and imprisoning superhumans, whom he mostly found by tracking Spider-Woman and capturing superhumans she interacted with. This included Angar, and other superhumansShroud,Tigra,Werewolf by Night,Poltergeist,Daddy Longlegs,Dansen Macabre,Hangman,Killer Shrike,Needle,Nekra,Gypsy Moth,Tatterdemalion,Enforcer, andFlying Tiger. When Locksmith finally captured Spider-Woman herself, she defeated Locksmith and freed the prisoners she trusted. Angar (and the other criminal prisoners) were turned over to the police.[16]\nAngar is one of the many criminals imprisoned in theVault.[17][18]\nAngar began a criminal duo withScreaming Mimi. They robbed banks disguised asHawkeyeandMockingbird. However the originals arrived to put a stop to them.[4]\nAngar was a regular visitor to theBar With No Name.[19]\nAngar joined the team calledAssault and Batteryalong withMad Dog,Smoke Scream, andOverrider. They battledNick Fury,S.H.I.E.L.D.andSuper Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D..[2]\nAngar and various other criminals witnessCaptain Americadisguised asCrossbonesbattleBatroc the Leaper.[20]\nAngar later attendedAbsorbing ManandTitania's wedding.[21]\nAngar battledSpider-Manalong with a group of other villains includingShrunken Bones,Gorilla-Man,Ruby Thursday, andChondu the Mystic. Led byDoctor Bongthey planned on conquering theMultiverseby creating a “Cosmic Bong” in the world’s quietest room.[22]\nWhile robbing a bank with Mimi, Angar was shot by a guard. Although the two were able to escape into the nearby woods, Angar soon died of blood loss. Mimi, whose wails of grief lasted for hours and leveled much of the surrounding forest, was tracked down and rescued byBaron Zemobefore police could get near. After Zemo hadFixeraugment her now-damaged vocal cords with a solid-sound harness (similar toKlaw's horn), Mimi agreed to join his newMasters of Evil, which would become theThunderbolts.[23]\nRedeemers\nWhen Zemo arrived to rescue Songbird, he also brought Angar's body. Angar's body was later examined by Fixer, and apparently used to form the sonic entity known asScream, who joined the team of reforming super-villains called theRedeemers.[3]The first battledThe Destructon.[24][25]The team then went up againstDoctor Doom.[26]They tried to helpCharcoal, but arrived too late.[27]Humus Sapienawoke inMount Charterisand the team was quickly defeated by him.[28]Scream checked his teammates to see if they were harmed. They soon reawakened and saw Humus Sapien leave the dimension, with his allyOgre. However they were then attacked byGraviton.[29]\nScream!\nGraviton wrapped Scream in a vacuum and dissipated him, then proceeded to take out the team.[30]As Graviton was finally defeated Scream reappeared, back in the form of Angar, over Songbird and absorbed all the sound around him.[31]Angar continued absorbing all the sound inBurton Canyonwhile Songbird tried to stop him. While Angar swatted aside S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft, Songbird had her carapace altered and used it to absorb Angar's form into it. She then smashed the carapace, finally killing him, but not before saying to her thank you.[32]\nSound Form:As a being made out of \"solid sound\", he could exist without food or sleep. He didn't need to breathe, but he needed air as a transmission medium to exist. He was immune to physical harm and could even reintegrate himself when dispersed. Scream could fly and manipulate sound around him. He could disorient opponents or use sound as a concussive weapon. Despite his ability to manipulate sound, Scream could not talk and seemed to be a mindless creature for most of his existence.[3]\nSonic Scream:Angar vocally emits piercing screams that create hallucinogenic effects in those who hear them. His screams stimulate the chemicals of the brain creating natural toxins that induce hallucinations and sometimes amnesia. Angar can not control the specific content of his victim's hallucinations. They are products of the victim's own subconscious. His power does tend to induce psychotic and nightmarish fantasies however.[34][35]"

However, their vacation is cut short when they spot a skier being murdered by a knife throwing lunatic. Chasing after the killer they note that he is horribly scarred and try to capture him. The killer causes an avalanche, burying the two heroes while he makes his escape. Freeing themselves from the snow, the only clue the Torch and Toro can find is a matchbook for a hotel that is sponsoring a nearby carnival, and that the man who was murdered was Price, one of the co-owners.\nGoing to the hotel they interview the carnival co-owner Mr. Howe and ask him if his carnival has any enemies. Howe told them how years ago he and his partner Price owned a vaudevillian theater that included knife thrower Jimmy Mack as one of the act. When a fire in the building left Mack horribly scarred, he vowed to get revenge against Howe and Price after suspicion of arson was ruled out. Deemed to be insane, Mack was locked up in a nearby insane asylum. Calling the asylum the heroes learned that Mack had escaped. Attacked by what appeared to be Jimmy Mack, the Torch and Toro fail to capture him and find Howe wounded with a knife.\nHowever, upon finding the same book of matches on Howe, the Torch deduces that Howe was really the one responsible for the murders. Howe confesses, explaining that he helped Jimmy Mack escape and locked him up in his cabin and forced Mack to teach him how to throw knives. Then with a lifelike mask cast to look like Mack, he murdered Price to take over the carnival. Howe attempts to flee the two heroes, however he is caught when he attempts to race across a frozen lake, which the Torch and Toro melt. Going to Howe's cabin, they find Mack chained up and he explains that he was forced to teach Howe to throw knives and all he wanted to do was return to the asylum and get help.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nWhen Colonel Carter is heading to Singapore with some secret documents he charges Steve Rogers and Bucky with accompanying him on the plane being piloted by Lieutenant Conroy.

As they watch Erik and the longship battle in the air, Thor laments on the whereabouts of Jaekelsson.\nBefore the can react, Jaekelsson appears behind the group and rams his sword through Thor's abdomen. Quickly dispatching Sigrid and Magnus, Jaekelsson centers on Thor, taunting him for his earlier defeat. Jaekelsson moves in for a final blow, but Thor counters, and usesMjolnirto remove Jaekelsson's left arm.\nAs Thor and Jaekelsson and Thor trade words and blows, Erik is horrified to see Vikings leaping from the longship onto his arrow-riddled plane. When his maneuvers and his side-arm are ineffective in removing the Vikings from his plane, Erik parachutes to safety, moments before the unmanned plane crashes into the longship in a fiery explosion.\nAs the ships above explode, Thor and Jaekelsson continue their fight. As Thor taunts the viking, Jaekelsson bites down on Thor's hand, and rips skin from bone with his teeth. Jaekelsson soon overpowers Thor, and begins choking him, bringing the God of Thunder to his knees. As Jaekelsson questions the three warriors from the past as to why they aren't helping Thor in his fight, the warriors tell Jaekelsson that Thor does not need their help in the fight, for he is a God, and Jaekelsson is nothing more than an enchanted corpse.

Snaring the God of Thunder with its tail, the Grendel begins constricting him, but Thor manages to break free and smashesMjolnirinto the monster's head. The Grendel crashlands on the shore of a lake and Thor flies away, victorious and oblivious to the presence of a second symbiote dragon. Rising from the depths of the lake, the enragedred symbiote dragonshrinks itself to a smaller size and attacksHeorot Hall, killing several Vikings - includingAeschere, King Hrothgar's best warrior - in retaliation.\nIn the present day, Detective Henley surveys the bloodbath that had taken place at theF.E.A.S.T. Centerbefore approachingAndi Benton- the sole eyewitness - and asking her what happened. TheScream symbiotewarning her not to trust him, Andi tells the detective he wouldn't believe her even if she told him. Abruptly, one of the corpses sits up, its jaw distending as an eel-like symbiote offshoot emerges from his mouth, hissing to Andi that \"Mother waits for you below.\" As Andi stomps on it, Detective Henley asks what it was; Andi retorting that trouble follows her.\nLater, Andi stands on a pier inRed Hook, mentally asking the Scream symbiote why they can't work with the police. The Scream symbiote retorts that Andi doesn't need a gallant prince or white knight to save her, and that a massive symbiote presence is lurking under the water, warning her that it's a trap. Andi replies that this \"massive symbiote presence\" attacked her first, so now they're bringing the fight to it. Diving into the water, Andi sneers at the Scream symbiote using the phrase \"gallant prince\", remarking that it reminds her of when her mother used to readRapunzelto her. Quoting the fairy tale, the Scream symbiote covers Andi, transforming her into an amphibious form with a tail and webbed digits. Marveling at her new form, Andi panics as she feels fluid in her lungs, the Scream symbiote assuring her that it will help her breathe underwater before asking her if the fairy tale reminds her of her mother. Swimming deeper, Andi replies that -- unlike kids who only remember the line about Rapunzel letting down her hair -- she can't forget the beginning, telling the Scream symbiote that it starts with a man stealing rampion from the garden of a witch to satiate his pregnant wife's cravings. Caught, the witch agrees to let him go and give him all the rampion his wife desires in exchange for their firstborn child.\nSwimming towards a shipwreck, Andi mentally berates Rapunzel's parents for giving up their daughter like that, before sympathetically stating that all the witch wanted was to be a mother. Abruptly, Scream is accosted by another undead symbiote-monster impersonating Andi's mother, snarling that this time she isn't falling for its lies as she rips it apart. A feminine voice welcomes Scream home and calls her daughter, Andi turning to see the humanoid form of the red symbiote dragon - Grendel's Mother - towering over her. As Grendel's Mother grabs her, Scream snarls that she is not the monster's daughter, Grendel's Mother retorting that she is the mother of all dead things. As Scream struggles to break free, Grendel's Mother admonishes her to stop squirming before remarking that both the Scream symbiote and its host know that Earth's time is running out:Knullis on his way to Earth and will slaughter every living thing on it, but she intends to ask him to let her keep Scream for herself. Scream snarls that she cannot have the symbiote or Andi, Grendel's Mother laughing before saying that she only wants the former and couldn't care less about the latter. Scream breaks free and tries to garrotte Grendel's Mother with her hair, the symbiote dragon summoning her army of undead monsters to defend her. Scream is overwhelmed, Andi panicking as the undead monsters attempt to rip her symbiote off. Lashing out with thorny tendrils, Scream rips the undead monsters apart, shouting that Grendel's Mother is not her family and that she is Scream. Paraphrasing the tagline forAlien, Grendel's Mother spits a torrent of blue flames that blasts Scream across the seafloor. As the Scream symbiote reels in pain, Andi desperately begs it not to leave her.\nBlacking out as the Scream symbiote separates from her, Andi wakes up in her old bedroom inPhiladelphia. Confused at not being able to sense the Scream symbiote, she hears voices talking in the kitchen and steps out to seeher fatherand her mother affectionately tellingFlash Thompsonabout how stubborn and determined she can be. As Flash greets her, Andi's drowning body slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean; Grendel's Mother restating that when Knull arrives he will grant her permission to claim the Scream symbiote as her daughter.\nA SINISTER SAGA SPINNING OUT OF THE PAGES OF THE LANDMARK VENOM SERIES!\n• After the events of ABSOLUTE CARNAGE, New York is in more danger than ever – and SCREAM is the only one who knows it!"

To stop him, theHulkand theAvengerstraveled to his space stationOmnivac. However, most of the Avengers vanished in the middle of their battle leaving only the Hulk and theShe-Hulkleft to try and stop the Leader's mad scheme. Learning that the Avengers have been sent to different points in time, they uncover the Leader's time platform. They then learn from Omnivac that the time machine is controlled by a mock organ that the Leader has constructed. The Hulk deciphers the notes that need to be played in order to activate the device. Soon, both the Hulk and She-Hulk jump into the time stream in order to recover the Avengers from different points of history so they can stop the Leader. As soon as they're gone, the remains of Omnivac's robot body begins inching toward the organ intent on destroying the device and trapping the two heroes in the past.\nThe two Hulks first appear inFrance, circa 1944, in the middle ofWorld War II. In the heat of a battle between Allied and Axis forces, the pair spotCaptain Americaand his wartime partnerBucky. Seeing the two legendary heroes in trouble, the Hulk suggests that they lend a hand. As they are fighting off theNazis, they notice that Captain America finds them familiar but can't remember where he has seen them before. Banner learns that the time-displaced Avengers have had their memories altered to make them think they belong in the eras they are trapped in. The two Hulks then approach Captain America and they are spirited back into the time stream just moments before a Nazi bomb goes off. Bucky fears that Cap has been killed when suddenly he is joined by the Captain America of his era, who had actually been separated from Bucky when the battle first began.\nThe Hulks and Captain America find themselves in 12th CenturyEnglandwhereHawkeyeis leadingRobin Hood'sMerry Men, thinking that he is the legendary archer. They are about to engage the forces of theBlack Duke, led byIron Manwho believes himself to be the Duke.

Captain America tosses his shield at the Leader, knocking him into an open lava flow behind him. Iron Man tries to grab their foe, but is too late and the Leader seemingly perishes in the lava.

As the woman says that she's searched for her and never gave up, theScream symbiotewarns Andi that it's a trap. Mentally snapping at it to shut up and allow her to believe that it's true, Andi tearfully hugs the woman. Saying that a piece of her lives in Andi and that she can feel it calling to her, the woman slowly transforms into a bloated corpse reanimated byliving abyss.\nAs Andi watches in horror and despair, the Scream symbiote emerges and takes over, the corpse revealing that Scream was who it was claiming as its child rather than Andi. Andi berates herself for having fallen for the monster's lies, the Scream symbiote telling her that they have no family save for each other, and that it will always protect her. Scuttling backwards, the corpse vomits living abyss onto some seafood being sold at a market stall, which forms into gestalt monstrosities. Noting that the monstrosities are animated using symbiotes, Andi asks the Scream symbiote who would want to go after them and why, and it replies that someone wants to separate them. Noting that symbiotes usually take living hosts, the Scream symbiote snarls that someone is using the undead abominations to hunt them.\nSnaring one of the monsters with her tendril hair, Scream demands to know who sent them, but is interrupted by thepoliceattempting to arrest her and flees up the side of a building. Perching on the roof, Andi laments that when she hugged the monster impersonating her mother she had desperately hoped the lie had been true, that she belonged with someone and had a home. The Scream symbiote tells her that it is her home and that they aren't so different - it doesn't even have a real name, never had a mother, and was abandoned byits \"father.\"\nThe reanimated corpse that had impersonated Andi's mother crawls through an alley towards a manhole, but is confronted by Agnes. Standing upright, it mockingly dismisses her as a threat until she disembowels it with her shiv. Snaring her with tendrils of living abyss that spill out of the wound, the symbiote vacates the corpse and bonds to her.\nAt theF.E.A.S.T.shelter, Andi is greeted byMay Parker, telling the older woman she's only back for the night. May tells Andi to stay as long as she needs and that her door is always open. As May turns the lights out, Andi worries that she's endangering everyone by being there, but that she needs to feel safe for once. As the Scream symbiote reiterates that it's there to protect her, Andi notes that she had thought that the monster impersonating her mother had been talking about her before wondering if it was talking about Scream.\nGrowling gibberish, Agnes' symbiote-controlled corpse shambles towards Andi before her bloated belly ruptures, spilling eel-like symbiotes that bond to the other guests. The Scream symbiote notes that they're symbiotes like itself, but weak offshoots barely connected to thehive, serving as little more than marionette strings. Cornered, Andi asks if there's a way to save the people being controlled, but the Scream symbiote tells her that they're already dead - drowned from the inside.\nAs Scream takes over, Andi tells the symbiote they should run. Ignoring her, Scream grabs one of the hosts and rips out the parasite, remarking that it smells like the ocean depths and death. Absorbing it, Scream suddenly doubles over - her eyespot changing into a jagged red spiral -- before she slaughters the hosts, ranting in an eldritch language that \"God\" is coming to destroy all life onEarth. Coming out to see what the commotion is, May shouts for Scream to stop - unfazed when the symbiote retracts to reveal Andi. Traumatized, Andi apologizes and says she couldn't control herself, before telling May she had a vision of God.\nBillions of years in the past, the dark elder godKnull- seated onhis throneand surrounded byhis horde, created a pair ofsymbiote dragons- oneblackand onered- and sent them out into the cosmos to annihilate all they came across. Arriving on Earth, the two symbiote-dragons rampaged acrossScandinavia, terrorizing theDanes.\nAt the bottom ofUpper New York Bay, the red symbiote-dragon - manifested in a feminine humanoid form - notes that the young symbiote called Scream reminds her of herself when she was newly born. Grousing that Scream's host is weak, the red symbiote-dragon wonders if Knull will let her keep Scream for herself to shelter, call her own, and to mother when he arrives.\n• Spinning directly out of the events of ABSOLUTE CARNAGE and Donny Cates’ and Ryan Stegman’s VENOM comes the saga of the newest symbiote in New York – SCREAM!"

When theCelestialsappeared and began flooding the Void with cosmic light, creating planets and seeding them with life, Knull awakened and was outraged by this pollution of his kingdom of darkness. When a Celestial picked him up to examine him, Knull bared his fangs, plunged his hand into his newly-cast shadow, and pulled outa sword of living darkness— the firstsymbiote. Decapitating the Celestial with a single strike, he attempted to attack the others but was repelled and cast back into the abyss. Convertingthe Celestial's severed headinto a forge, Knull used its divine energy to refine the crude blade - revealing that the symbiotes' vulnerability to intense heat and sound is a psychosomatic condition passed down through their genetic memory of this forging.\nManifesting a suit of armor from the same eldritch darkness as his sword, Knull embarked on a genocide against the gods; his symbiotic weapon becoming known as All-Black theNecrosword. While massacring a group of gold-armored gods, Knull was stabbed through the face while simultaneously impaling the last god through the heart. Crash-landing ona desolate planet, Knull awakened to find that All-Black had been stolen byone of the planet's indigenous inhabitants- who would unwittingly go on to continue Knull's deicidal crusade. Knull condescendingly asks Eddie if he can comprehend what it would be like to have a dark god fall from the sky and provide a weapon of incomprehensible power, the depths of madness a mortal would need to possess in order to wield such a weapon; and is amusedly impressed when Eddie says he can and asks Knull to continue. Alone and stranded, Knull spent at least a century convalescing in the crater. Emerging when a strange new hunger arose inside him, Knull discovered he could manifest the eldritch \"living abyss\" that had formed his sword and armor into amorphous parasites that could be bonded to \"lesser creatures\", turning them into predatory monsters that Knull could control and draw strength from. Knull amasseda massive army of these symbiotes, conquered the planet, and established himself as the nexus of their hive-mind. Refining his creations to construct a replacement symbiote-sword and a fleet ofsymbiote-dragons, Knull and his army conquered countless worlds and devoured entire civilizations.\nDrawn toEarthby its abundance of the cosmic light he hated, Knull inhabitedone of his symbiote-dragonsand attackedScandinaviaduring the sixth century CE, reveling in the terror his creation - dubbed Grendel - inspired in the planet's indigenous population. However, Knull's rampage attracted the attention ofa powerful young storm-god, whose divine lightning severed his connection to the symbiote hive-mind. Freed from Knull's control, the symbiote-dragons unraveled into countless offshoot symbiotes, which sought out new hosts to give their lives context and existence meaning. On theSymbiote Throneworld,the symbiotes who had bonded to benevolent and noble hostsrebelled against Knull, overwhelming and drowning him in the very abyss he had created.\nHolding up the Venom symbiote, whose eyespots have turned red, Knull asks Eddie if he understands the dark secret of how the symbiotes became the symbiotes. Eddie stammers that it can't be true, Knull sneering that the symbiotes of Klyntar are liars and traitors who are desperate to conceal their dark past. When Knull gloats that he's close to breaking free from the traitor symbiotes' \"klyntar,\" Eddie incredulously asks what he means; saying that his symbiote was told that \"Klyntar\" was the name of the symbiotes' species and homeworld. Knull mockingly tells Eddie that everything the Agents of the Cosmos had told the Venom symbiote had been a lie, and shows him that the the so-called \"Planet of the Symbiotes\" is nothing more than a planet-sized cocoon of symbiotes imprisoning his body - \"klyntar\" being the symbiotes' word for \"cage.\" Knull thanks Eddie for aiding in his resurrection, noting that he undoubtedly had no choice in the matter given the Venom symbiote's reaction to his awakening. Knull states that once he recovers all the missing pieces of Grendel, he will use it to free himself from Klyntar and resume his conquest of the universe - starting with Earth.Spider-Manregains consciousness and punches Knull in the face with a Venom Blast, urging Eddie to get up as the Venom symbiote rebonds to him. Knull, his avatar twisted and destabilized, sneers that Miles is a fool for underestimating him and doubting his power. Ignoring Knull, Miles tries to rip open a hole in the wall of symbiote biomass, only to see that Knull has reformed Grendel's dragon form around them and they are flying into space.\n• An ancient Klyntar has awakened on Earth, and with it, something has stirred in Eddie Brock’s symbiote."

Thor was raised by the Frost Giants?\"Appearances·SynopsisWriter(s)Ethan SacksPenciler(s)Michele BandiniInker(s)Michele BandiniColorist(s)Matt MillaLetterer(s)Joe SabinoEditor(s)Dan Edington\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nAn unspoken narrator speaks to an unspoken audience, telling them the tale that unfolds on the pages. King Laufey of the Frost Giants leads his people into war against the Asgardians, under King Odin. After a long battle, Laufey is victorious when Odin misses a crucial thrust, allowing Laufey to slay the Asgardian king with his magical hammer, Ice Crusher. Victorious, the Frost Giants sack Asgard, slaughtering all save Freya and Thor; the former to rot in Laufey's prison, the latter to be claimed as Laufey's adoptive son, the ultimate triumph over his fallen foe.\nIn the frozen dungeons of Laufey's castle in Jotunheim, Loki sneaks into Thor's cell, hoping to befriend his new \"brother\". Thor is grateful for Loki's kindly gift of furs to weather the frigid chill of his new home, and Loki gives him a crudely carved amulet as a symbol of their brotherhood.\nAn unknown period of time later, Thor and Loki are part of a hunting party of young Frost Giants, seeking to bring down a monstrous Jotunheim beast. The boys watch as Laufey cruelly orders the other giants to charge blindly at the monster, with it killing several of them before Loki tries to impress his father by using his magic to veil himself in invisibility and slip in close enough to kill it. He only earns his father's contempt, as the creature uses its other senses to find Loki and pins him down. Loki begs for Laufey to save him, but it is Thor who leaps to his brother's rescue; although swallowed by the beast, he conjures a mighty lightning bolt that strikes it dead, ripping his way free of its guts and calling himself \"Prince of Winter\" - clearly, he has grown comfortable in his once-unwanted home.\nThor is jubilant, but Loki is humiliated - especially when Laufey tells Thor that he should have let Loki die, for he is a shame to the Frost Giants. Thor, on the other hand, he finds far more worthy, telling him that he may one day wield Ice Crusher, the weapon of the Frost Giant Kings. A Frost Giant named Grimr protests this, but Laufey cuts him off. Thor tries to share his excitement with Loki, but Loki has already left.\nIn the dungeons, Loki broods and discovers the long-forgotten Freya, who offers him the one thing nobody else would in Jotunheim: a sympathetic ear. Years pass, with Loki and Thor both growing to adulthood, and Loki regularly steals away to the dungeons to talk to Freya, learning magic from her and exulting in the kindness she shows him. He keeps the truth of her son's survival from her, in an act of childish selfishness, but also employs his growing sorcerous skills to bring her what comfort he can.\nAs one such session comes to an end, in the halls above, Laufey pits Thor against Grimr in mortal combat, for Grimr has continued to speak against Laufey's plan to name Thor as the next King of Jotunheim. Thor is not eager to slay someone he has hunted with for so long, but Grimr's taunts and Laufey's talk of honor sees them battle. Knocking his larger foe to the floor by shattering his knee with a punch, Thor is officially bequeathed Ice Crusher, and at Laufey's command, he uses it to slay Grimr.\nLoki returns and sardonically congratulates Thor on his new position as Crown Prince; Thor is blind to how his brother has grown detached from him, greeting him with what the former Asgardian believes is genuine affection and good humor. He then tells Loki that Laufey has commanded both of his sons march to war against Surtur and the Fire Giants of Muspelheim with him tomorrow.\nThis makes up Loki's mind; he has no desire to risk his tender skin against the burning wrath of the Fire Giants. Using his magic, he steals into the dungeon, bespells the guards, and frees Freya.\nSoon afterwards, Laufey leads a confused Thor through the frozen-over ruins of Asgard, telling his confused ward that the war against Muspelheim has been postponed to hunt a traitor. Unknowingly passing by the ice-covered Mjolnir, Thor assures Laufey that he feels no pull to this place, and is a true son of Jotunheim now. In a rare moment of tenderness, Laufey apologizes to Thor, admitting that he knows it hasn't been easy for Thor to be his adopted son and telling Thor that he believes Thor to be the only person in the Nine Realms who would not let him down.\nThey come across Laufey's targets; Loki and Freya, seeking to rebuild the Bifrost so they might flee to Midgard together. Laufey charges in, grabbing Loki and starting to crush him, dismissing Thor's pleas for mercy. Loki swiftly conjures a dagger and slays his unprepared father, stabbing him in the eye and then cutting his throat as he reels. Laufey's death enrages Thor, who attacks Loki in pursuit of vengeance, despite Loki's attempt to talk him down. When Thor unleashes a blast of utter cold from Ice Crusher, Freya pushes Loki to safety but is slain by it. Thor is horrified when he realizes he has just killed his own mother and resumes his attack on Loki; pinning the runty Frost Giant down and preparing to stave his head in, Loki pleads that he just wanted to leave and find his own path.\nFor whatever reason, Thor lowers his hammer and tells Loki to go. Loki tells Thor that he could come to Midgard with him, be free of everything he has had to deal with, but Thor refuses; with Laufey dead, Jotunheim will need Thor to defend it from fire demons, dark elves, trolls, and all the other monsters and malevolent peoples of the Nine Realms. The Frost Giants may not be Thor's people by blood, but they are still his people; they need him, and so he has a purpose. He tells Loki to find his own purpose, and then watches as Loki vanishes across the Bifrost before falling to his knees and mourning, lightning bolts spitting from the sky and arcing across the ruins around him.\nOur narrator reveals himself as a man in a hut on Midgard, telling his tale to a pair of boys for distraction from a midwinter storm. He concludes that Loki went on to become a mighty champion of Midgard, but such is a tale for another night. The boys wonder if they will ever get to see Thor, even as the storyteller warns them that such might not be for the best. A woman, the boys' mother - and apparently the storyteller's wife - scolds him for telling them such stories and tells him to go out and get some more firewood, which he retreats to do with a chuckle. Outside, he stops in amazement; lying in the snow is the amulet that Loki gave to Thor so long ago.\nHe picks it up and looks into the snowy, stormy sky in wonder, revealing himself to be Loki."

Soon Sir Mordred brings robber baron Sir Gilles who has come to ask for Lady Rosamund's hand in marriage. King Arthur refuses to allow the marriage, however agrees that if Sir Gilles brings him the Dragon of Kentswood Swamp he will allow the marriage -- confident that Gilles will fail due to the fact that the dragon does not exist.\nSir Percy fears that there is some king of duplicity at hand due to the fact that Sir Gilles and Sir Mordred are later seen conspiring together -- another one of Mordred's plots to take over the kingdom. Weeks later when everyone has but forgotten Sir Gilles challenge, he arrives with what appears to be a dragon. However, he tells King Arthur that the creature should not be fought until the following morning.\nHowever present is the Black Knight who offers to battle the creature right away. When Sir Gilles refuses to allow him, the Black Knight challenges him to a duel, and defeats him in a joust and then attacks the dragon, smashing it open to reveal it is not only fake but has an army of Sir Gilles' soldiers hiding inside. The Black Knight easily defeats the soldiers. With the battle over, Lady Rosamund gives the Black Knight a rose as a token of her thanks before the masked hero sneaks off to resume his unassuming alter-ego of Sir Percy.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nSir Percy is riding through the woods when he is suddenly attacked by a gang of thieves. However to their surprise Sir Percy fights his way free. He learns that these men have turned to a life of thievery because Sheriff Joshua Costain has been over taxing them. After Sir Percy defeats the thieves leader he assures them that King Arthur does not tax his people, Sir Percy promises to get a knight from Arthur's court to come and deal with the matter.\nRiding to cover, Sir Percy then changes into his alter-ego of the Black Knight. Arriving in town, the Black Knight seeks an audience with Sir Joshua Costain and sees him living in opulence and orders him to return the money he has taken from his people. When Costain refuses, and before the Black Knight can use force he is knocked out from behind and is tossed into the dungeon. However the Black Knight is freed by the thieves and he leads them in overthrowing Sir Costain from his position of power.\nReturning to Camelot in his alter-ego of Sir Percy, the Black Knight feigns interest in word of the Black Knights latest exploits and complains about the dreadful dust he experienced while out riding.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nThe Crusader helps King Richard fight off another legion of the Saladin's minions before they camp out for the night. After night falls, Sir Guy de Montfort and his minion Baron Hinden conspire to capture King Richard in order to trick the Crusader into thinking that the Saladin kidnapped their ruler and eliminate both threats so that De Montfort can take control. As King Richard sleeps, Guy and the Baron attack, knocking him out and taking him prisoner.\nHearing the commotion, the Crusader awakens to find the king missing without a trace. As per De Montfort's plans, the Crusader suspects that the Saladin has kidnapped their king. So the Crusader dawns his traditional Muslim clothing and pays audience to the Saladin, and learn the truth. An honorable warrior, the Saladin tells the Crusader that he does not have Richard as a prisoner and gives the warrior a blood hound to track down Richard.\nThe Crusader takes the dog back to his army's camp and the dog tracks Richard's scent to cavern where he fights De Montfort's minions and forcing them to flee. He frees King Richard and brings him camp knowing that De Montfort was behind this latest attack on the King, but cannot do anything without proof.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nWhen Mohar Jinn, the leader of the Asian Tartars has come to Camelot to wrestle with Camelot's best warriors to the amusement of King Arthur and his court and as an ambassador to his people. King Arthur tells the Tartar that he and his knights are heading on a pilgrimage to the sea. Sir Percy is called into Merlin's private chambers where the old wizard warns him that his crystal ball predicts danger coming but cannot tell from what. Percy tells Merlin to stash his Black Knight armor in a nearby tree by the sea so that he can face any trouble as his alter-ego.\nAlong the way to the sea, King Arthur and his knights decide to stop for the night at an inn. There they are ambushed and all, including King Arthur and Sir Percy, are taken prisoner. They soon find that they are prisoners of the Tartars led by Mohar Jinn's brother, all part of a plot to conquer Camelot. Soon King Arthur is locked aboard the Tartars ship and Sir Percy and the other knights are chained in the slave galley to operate the ores.\nNoticing that the wood around their shackles is rotting, Sir Percy and his fellows ration their water to put on the wood and rot it enough to break free. They then storm the soldiers on the ship and easily take control of the ship, freeing King Arthur in the process. Returning to the mainland, King Arthur -- although weakened -- orders his men back to Camelot. Sir Percy feigns fatigue and stays behind just long enough to change into the Black Knight. On his way back to Camelot, he is stopped by Merlin who warns that the Mohar has taken over the castle. The elderly wizard then leads the Black Knight through the secret passages within the castle.\nThere the Black Knight fights through Mohar Jinn's minions and arrives in the throne room just as King Arthur falters in combat against Mohar Jinn. The Black Knight then steps in and defeats Mohar Jinn in combat, allowing King Arthur to retake his kingdom. Before the Black Knight can be thanked he slips away so he can change back into Sir Percy and \"return\" to the castle."

As Andi states that all three of them are dead, Flash tells her to let go and join them. Andi admits to herself that no matter how much she may wish it was real, it isn't; the room flooding with water and her parents decaying into skeletons. Realizing she's drowning, Andi asks herself if this isn't what she wanted - to die and reunite with her family. Just as Andi gives up, the Scream symbiote rebonds to her and urges her to keep fighting, telling her that as long as they're together she'll never be alone. Andi regaining her resolve to keep fighting, Scream attacks the undead monsters; the symbiote telling Andi that while herdemonically-augmentedrage nourishes it and makes her a potent host, there is something even greater inside her than wrath: love.\nGrendel's Motherabruptly grabs Scream and slams her into the seafloor, scornfully chastising the lesser symbiote for clinging to a weak mortal host like a child does a safety blanket. Transformed into a massive feminine beast intermediary between her dragon and humanoid forms, Grendel's Mother snarls that only Scream's \"Big Mother\" can see her true potential and help her realize it. Scream snaps that the symbiote dragon isn't her mother, but Grendel's Mother snaps that she's older than time itself and intends to show Scream just what kind of mother she can be. Scream snaps that Grendel's Mother knows nothing about love, but Grendel's Mother counters by saying she felt ineffable rage when her counterpart, theGrendel, was struck down by the hero called \"Beowulf,\" and that she nursed her wrath across centuries after being sealed away.\nShe admits to having been awed by the splendor of the modern worldafter shewas unleashed, but that she came to her senses and realized that nothing had changed after discovering that the warrior who had vanquished her and her \"son\" -Thor Odinson- was revered as a hero, rekindling her hatred. Grendel's Mother states that discovering Scream filled her with a burning warmth, licking the lesser symbiote's face and asking her if that isn't a mother's love. Admitting thattheir kindusually care nothing for love and family, Grendel's Mother reiterates that Scream has given her something other than hatred to cling to and that she has no intentions of sharing the symbiote with its \"piffling trifle\" of a host.\nGrendel's Mother attempts to rip the Scream symbiote off Andi again, slamming her into the seafloor and snapping that whenKnullarrives the Earth will belong to the symbiotes and all life on it will be reduced to dust. As bones wrapped in tendrils of living abyss bind Scream to the ground, Grendel's Mother states that when that happens Scream will realize her true potential as a demigod, fit to rule in service of the King in Black. Several symbiote-infected crabs burrow into the Scream symbiote, Andi revolted that she can feel them crawling across her body. Breaking free, Scream shouts that they are not family, absorbing the crabs and sprouting mandibles and four arthropod legs from her back.\nRemarking that unruly children always think they know better than their parents, Grendel's Mother swipes Scream with her talons and sends her careening into the side of the sunken ship. Wrapping her hair-tendrils around the propeller, Scream states that family isn't just bound by blood and that the symbiote's bond to Andi is stronger than its ties to the rest of its kind. Hurling the propeller, Scream quips that she's officially cutting herself off from Grendel's Mother side of the family. Enraged, Grendel's Mother roars that Scream knows nothing of birthrights or lineage, charging towards her with her wings flared. Sprouting fin-shaped wings of her own, Scream takes off - Andi panicking as Grendel's Mother gains on them.\nReaching the surface, Scream hovers over the water - Andi openly admitting for the first time that the symbiote is the only family she has left - in turn, the Scream symbiote promises Andi that as long as they are bonded Andi will always have a family and never be alone. Before Scream can fly away, Grendel's Mother's hand erupts from the ocean and grabs her as she says that letting go is one of the hardest things in life, and that change is never easy. As she drags Scream back down into the depths, Grendel's Mother mockingly offers to tell Andi a \"bedtime story\" before \"tucking her in\" and saying \"goodnight.\"\nIn sixth-century Denmark, Thor Odinson lamentingly carries out the bodies of those slain by Grendel's Mother the previous night, helping the mourners bundle them into boats and send them off down the river. His heart full of vengeance, Thor treks through mountains and forests until he comes across the body of a deer half-crushed by a massive taloned footprint, and a gruesome ritualistic display made bythose who worshiped the symbiotes. Coming across a fetid lake at the base of a waterfall, Thor realizes he's found the symbiote dragons' lair. Brandishing Mjolnir, Thor ventures into the half-flooded corpse-strewn cave behind the falls.\nAgain attempting to rip the Scream symbiote off Andi, Grendel's Mother states that the stories told of her kind were intended to make the mortal vermin of Earth fear them and to herald the arrival of Knull. Rebuking the Scream symbiote for bonding to a mortal host, Grendel's Mother states that doing so has polluted its majesty and sapped its grandeur. Ripping the Scream symbiote away a second time, Grendel's Mother states that when Knull arrives she will show both her progenitor and the Scream symbiote itself what it is truly capable of. Just before their bond is severed, the Scream symbiote urges Andi to escape. Desperately swimming for the surface, Andi realizes she's too deep to make it, but refuses to give up this time. As Andi pushes herself to the breaking point, Grendel's Mother rises up beneath her, opens her jaws, and swallows Andi whole.\nSPINNING OUT OF THE PAGES OF THE VENOM EVENT OF THE YEAR, ABSOLUTE CARNAGE!\n• SCREAM faces an ancient evil from the depths of the sea!\n• Watch as the VENOM lore builds the history of the symbiotes into a twisted tale of horror and menace!"

In a show of force, Jaekelsson and his crew kill all the men and children of the village, and have their way with the town's women, before killing them as well.\nJaekelsson, aware that his actions will brand him a renegade and a wanted man, proposes to his men that they sail West, to the fabled \"New World\", where their plundering won't be hindered by laws. The crew agrees, and makes preparations to set sail. But as they leave the bay, the town's wise man, having survived the chaos, calls out Jaekelsson as the son of a jackal and a coward. As the wise man cuts himself and drains the blood into a runestone, he utters a curse upon Jaekelsson and his crew, damning them to sail for a thousand years withouth their destination. Jaekelsson then shoots and kills him with a bow and arrow.\nThe wise man's curse would come to pass, and Jaekelsson's ship sailed endlessly through the ocean for a thousand years, until one day, the corpse-like Vikings spot land.

Meanwhile not far away, Lady Rosamund is learning falconry with Sir Percy for company. She is impressed by his musical abilities but confesses that she wishes he could be a braver man. Suddenly Lief the Lucky and his men attack and Rosamund is taken prisoner. Percy attempts to defend her then remembers that an act of heroism could compromise his double identity and then appears to flee, leaving Rosamund to think of him as a coward. Sir Percy however is far from, and soon follows after Lief and his army after has changed into his alter-ego of the Black Knight.\nMeanwhile, Lief has come to find Rosamund to be quite fair and decides to take her back with him to be his bride in Germany when suddenly the Black Knight arrives at the shores and attacks. The Black Knight easily fights off Lief's forces and rides after his boat before it can get too deep out to sea. The Black Knight attacks their ship, grabbing Rosamund and pulling back as the Norsemen flee the scene. With noblemen from Camelot approaching, the Black Knight leaves them in her care. Back at the castle, Sir Percy offers to sing Rosamond a song about falconry, but she cheekily suggests he plays one about how he fled the Norsemen leaving her to be rescued by the Black Knight instead.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nMordred has won a series of jousting competitions proving that he is the champion among the people of Camelot. As Sir Percy once more try to woo Lady Rosamund (and fails, as usual), Mordred challenges King Arthur to a jousting match, reminding Arthur that it is his right to ask as champion of the match and King Arthur agrees. While King Arthur prepares for the match, Mordred slips into his tent where he meets with an loyal alchemist who gives Mordred a potent poison to coat his joust with it, telling Mordred that one single scratch from the poisoned weapon will cause King Arthur to die slowly and painfully, but yet appear to die of natural causes.\nAs King Arthur feats before the match, Merlin retires to his chambers and views his crystal ball, learning of Mordred's plot. He then returns to the banquet hall to warn Sir Percy, telling him to change into the Black Knight. Shortly thereafter as the King and Mordred prepare to duel, the Black Knight suddenly interrupts challenging Mordred to a joust instead, pointing out that Mordred cannot be named the champion until he bests him in a joust first. Mordred is forced to agree, however he believes this is his opportunity to rid himself of the Black Knight as well.\nDuring the first charge of the competition, the Black Knight's lance is broken against Mordred's shield. However, when Mordred attempts to stab the Black Knight with his own on the reverse pass, the Black Knight slices off its poison tip with his Ebony Blade, winning the match. King Arthur calls for a feast for the Black Knight's victory, and Mordred takes this as an opportunity to try and learn the Black Knight's secret identity. He orders his men to slow down the Black Knight as he returns to the castle so that he can do a room-to-room search to try and uncover this identity. Returning to the castle, Merlin warns the Black Knight of this plot, telling the warrior to use a secret passage in his chambers to return to his room. The Black Knight is jumped by some of Mordred's men along the way but he easily fights them off. Using Merlin's secret passage up to his quarters Sir Percy strips off his Black Knight armor just as Mordred -- finding it hard to believe that his cowardly cousin could possibly be the Black Knight -- bursts into his room. He finds Sir Percy climbing out from under a desk, and Sir Percy claims that he hid under there to get away from all the loud noises from the jousting competition, allaying any suspicions Mordred might have had that Percy is the Black Knight.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nContinued from last issue...\nOn his quest to join King Richard I of England, El Alemain, now known as the Crusader fights through the last of the Mongolian warriors whom he travelled with prior to meeting his late brother Sir John O'Dare. His travels take him to Egypt where he clashes with the Muslim warriors there coming to the aid of King Richard and his men, turning the tide of battle. King Richard learns of El Alemain's origins and quest to continue the battle for his brother, King Richard accepts him with open arms but some of his men are less than accepting. One knight even attempting to attack the Crusader, but King Richard stops him.\nSuddenly, the Saladin of Egypt appears and the Crusader offers to battle him. The two clash with honor for one another, and although the Saladin proves to be a fierce fighter, he ultimately loses to the Crusader who lets the Saladin go free, hoping to meet him in battle again. While the lone dissenter against the Crusader believes this proves their new arrival is not loyal to the King, King Richard believes otherwise and officially knights the Crusader and welcomes him among his army.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nWith a peasant's holiday being celebrated, King Arthur and his knights leave Castle Camelot in order to celebrate with his subjects, leaving Mordred in charge of the kingdom in his absence. Watching the King and his men leaving the castle is the Black Knight who vows to protect the kingdom from Mordred's secret ambitions of ruling England.\nAs soon as Arthur is gone, Mordred and his wife Morgan le Fay begin plotting their conquest of Camelot immediately, sending one of their loyal minions out to inform Sir Robert de Quincy of the Normans to attack the castle so that he can lead the palace guard, hoping that with Sir Robert's help he will conquer and jointly rule England until such a time that he can eliminate Du Quincy. When the Normans finally attack, Mordred leads them into battle. Seeing this is Sir Percy who knows that the King would never allow a counter attack in his absence and so he changes into the Black Knight to interfere with Mordred's plans.\nWith the forces of Camelot failing, the Black Knight arrives and turns the tide, ruining Mordred's attempts to \"surrender\" to the Normans. As the Normans fall back, Mordred orders the knights to return to the castle. While nobody is looking, Mordred strikes a blow to the Black Knight's head leaving him falling into the castle moat. Telling the others that the Black Knight has fallen, he orders the drawbridge raised. However the Black Knight has survived the blow and rises to the surface and sees men loyal to Mordred searching for him to finish the job. Using a reed as a make-shift snorkel, the Black Knight hides underwater from their search.\nSneaking into the castle as King Arthur is returning back, the Black Knight spots Mordred raising the rear portcullis to let the Normans in and joins King Arthur and his knights in battling the enemy invaders, easily defeating them. In the aftermath of the battle, the Black Knight departs to change back into his alter-ego. Sir Percy then listens as King Arthur commends Mordred for helping fight back the invasion, unable to reveal Mordred's duplicity due to a lack of evidence to prove his claims."

Meanwhile, in his own world, Conan's getting lucky. Unfortunately, his tryst is interrupted by the Brotherhood of the Falcon, in yet another foolish attempt by their organization to kill the Cimmerian. Conan is helped by a mysterious man with an axe, the Gray Wolf, who sucker punches the barbarian and takes him to the portal to Konar's world. In the year since Conan visited, Konar has come to realize that Conan had actually helped his reign, and now he needs Conan to help rescue Zenoria, who has been kidnapped in hopes of stalling a peace treaty between Aquiloria, Nemeria, and Ophit. Conan leaves the city dressed as Konar, thus distracting the kidnappers into assuming Konar has left the town and unable to attend the treaty signings. Outside of town, Conan deals with some cutthroats while Konar meets with Zarnoff, much to the surprise of the kidnappers. Gray Wolf reveals himself as a traitor when he tells the kidnappers the truth about Conan, and that he is on his way to Nermeia to rescue Zenoria. The kidnappers send news to King Olar of Nemeria and try to disrupt the peace talks by assassinating Zarnoff's counselors. Meanwhile, Conan has breached the underground tunnels of Olar's castle and is captured by the Nemerians, who mistake him for Konar and torture him. When they bring in Zenoria and threaten to torture her, it galvanizes Conan into breaking free of his bonds and killing lots of Nemerians. In Aquiloria, talks break down when the bodies are discovered, and Zarnoff gives Konar 24 hours to weed out the culprits. Conan and Zenoria start trekking back to her home country, but are stopped by the Gray Wolf. After a brutal fight, the two combatants fall off a cliff into a lake, but it is the Gray Wolf who rises. Zenoria flees to Aquiloria and the safety of her husband, who has his hands full with Nemerian assassins. Things look bad for Konar, until the Gray Wolf arrives and begins to slaughter the assassins. Gray Wolf reveals himself to be Conan, simply wearing the Wolf's distinctive garb. The treaty is signed, and Conan returns to his world.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nDeities and Invocations:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nEvents and Eras:"

Thor has just defeated a Frost Giant that had terrorized the inhabitants of a local village. Thor is enjoying the village's food, ale and women when he is suddenly interrupted by a shriek. The shriek is from a little girl who claims to have found a \"devil man\" in the water. Thor and the others go to investigate and find the severed head of a Native American. Thor tells them that he head belongs to a slain god. The villagers question what could have done this to a god since he has been butchered and not attacked by a beast. Thor dismisses their concerns, telling them that whatever it was is no match for him and orders a funeral pyre built for the dead god.\nIn the present day, a little girl on the planet Indigarr prays to Thor for rain on her barren world. Thor appears and conjures a great rainstorm and breaks the ground, revealing underground water currents. Thor is invited to feast with the little girl's people and tells them stories of the wonders of Asgard. After the festivities, Thor asks one of the elders why the little girl did not pray to their own gods. The elder informs Thor that Indigarr does not have any gods. When Thor questions this, the elder tells him that there are old stories about gods from long ago who lived in the sky but that no one believes those stories anymore. Thor goes to investigate and finds a palace in the sky. He searches the many rooms but finds no sign of life. After entering a room with a chained door, he finds the corpses of all the gods of Indigarr. He notes that since godlfesh rots slowly, they've been dead for hundreds of years and whoever did this took great pleasure in the act. Thor is attacked by a lizard-like creature and suddenly realizes that the killer of these gods is Gorr the God Butcher, someone he faced over 1000 years ago in Iceland.\nMany millennia from the present, a broken down, old Thor with one eye and one arm sits on the throne of an empty Asgard. Thor curses the silence of the empty Asgard and resolves that if he is to die, he will die in battle. He calls for someone to bring him his arm, before remembering that there is no one to do so. Armed with Mjolnir and the Odinsword, Thor leaps into a horde of lizard-like creatures (like the one he faced on Indigarr) and vows the death of Gorr the God Butcher."

Strange recognizes that the wise man is using a runestone, and remarks that rune magic is very tricky, and not something that should be attempted by amateurs. Strange informs Thor that runestones are fed by human blood, and the blood is what fuels the spell. He points out that when the wise man was killed by Jaekelsson, his blood continued to flow into the runestone, causing the spell to be amplified many times over, which resulted in the Vikings ability to live on for a thousand years.\nStrange tells Thor that the only way to defeat the curse is to find members of the wise man's bloodline. As they search through time, they find three warriors that look promising:Sigrid, a female Viking,Magnus of the Danes, a Teutonic Knight, andErik, a Luftwaffe pilot.\nMeanwhile, back in Manhattan, the Avengers have failed in their battle against Jaekelsson's forces, withIron ManandHawkeyeboth suffering major injuries.

Seeing that Thor is of no threat, Jaekelsson sends his crew into the city, where the Vikings begin to pillage, rape and slaughter.\nThe Vikings show no mercy to the citizens ofManhattan, slaughtering men, women and children alike, leaving hundreds dead and the city in rubble. Thor struggles to bring down Jaekelsson, but each attack proves unsuccessful, and only leads to further injury to Thor.\nAs Thor and Jaekelsson continue their fight, theNYPDand theUnited States Armyare dispatched in force to deal with the Vikings, with the Army taking to the air in combat helicopters. As they track the Vikings towards Canal Street, the police vehicles are stopped in their tracks by a mound made up of hundreds of severed heads, stack nearly 2 stories high.\nBack at theseaport, Thor, exhausted and badly injured, has been defeated by Jaekelsson. Jaekelsson takes a chain and loops it around Thor's neck, and attaches the other end to the handle of Mjolnir. Jaekelsson then drags Thor to the end of the dock, and throws the Thunder God to the bottom of the bay.\nAs the Army closes in on the Vikings, they regroup at the seaport with Jaekelsson, and board their ship. Through unknown means, the Viking ship rises into the air, and begins flying through the city towards the soldiers. When they meet, the Vikings overwhelm the soldiers and officers, slaughtering all but a small handful, and destroying their vehicles as well.\nAs night falls in the city, Thor manages to pull himself from the water onto the dock. As he slumps against a wall, drained of energy, Thor is surprised to findStephen Strangewaiting for him."

They contact their friend Little Moose, who reports mysterious activities in an abandoned village. Cap and Bucky investigate a campfire, but find only would-be gold prospector Pete. The Vulture and his men capture all three and take them to a subterranean hideout.\nBucky and Pete are shackled in a dungeon, but Cap escapes and returns to Little Moose's reservation, where Camp Mojave's Lt. Stewart reports that Moose, a Vulture mask planted in his possessions, has been arrested. Cap vouches for Moose and Stewart departs to summon backup from Camp Mojave, but a Vulture kills him. Meanwhile, Cap tells Moose's fellow Mojaves that the Vultures are 'foreign sneaks\" hiding behind \"the name of the First Americans,\" and they agree to help. Meanwhile, Vulture's men place Bucky and Pete in a hole which is filling with water, to drown them. Finding the hideout entrance blocked, Cap scales a ladder and discovers Japanese soldiers.

Sickles bets Roddy that he can sell more Defense Stamps and rushes off hoping to undercut Roddy on his sales by approaching his customers first.\nRoddy goes about his business, uninterested in competition, and delivers a paper to Mr. Lentz's house. When he asks Lentz to buy some Defense Stamps, he angrily rejects the offer and slams the door in the boys face. Finding this suspicious, Roddy decides to investigate Mr. Lentz — as the Secret Stamp. As it turns out Lentz is really a Nazi spy and the Secret Stamp witnesses one of Lentz's comrades enter his home through a secret passage and decides to follow. Inside the secret tunnel he overhears Lentz and his allies talk about how they intend to detonate the local power plant in Freetown as a test for a much larger scale attack on New York City.\nThe Secret Stamp attacks the spies, however when Spud wanders into the tunnel his presence distracts Secret Stamp long enough for Lentz to shoot the boy in the arm. Thinking the boy will bleed to death, Lentz has one of his men drag the Secret Stamp out of the secret tunnel and they tie up Spud so he doesn't interfere with them when they blow up the power plant.\nLeft alone to die, Secret Stamp stops playing possum and puts a tourniquet on his bullet wound. Calling his reporter friend Jerry Dash and tipping him off to spy activities from his bike radio, Secret Stamp then rushes back into the tunnel after the crooks. Learning where they went from Spud, the Secret Stamp rushes down to confront them. He stops them just before they can pull down the plunger to their explosives, and knocks the men out with a single punch each. Leaving his trademark of Defense Stamps on the spies' foreheads, the Secret Stamp flees before Jerry and the police arrive on the scene.\nLater, Jerry thanks Roddy for the scoop. Later still, Roddy runs into Spud who tells him that Secret Stamp is a close personal friend. Smiling to himself, Roddy asks Spud to introduce them sometime."

If Thor defeats the Tarene-animated Destroyer, the future Reigning will come to pass and mankind will not evolve like it should.  Inside the Destroyer armor, Tarene tries to fight the armor's destructive impulses, but to no avail, while Loki and Karnilla watch.  Thor and the Destroyer continue to battle, and the Destroyer grabs Mjolnir away from Thor, and begins to beat the thunder god with it.  Among the debris of battle, Keith finds Jane and tells her to run and get help.  After she leaves, Marnot sees Keith and tells him that he knows who he really is.  Marnot tells him that he might wear a mortal form, but it's not mortal life inside, and Keith then grabs Marnot and kills him.  Thor and the Destroyer continue their battle, but without Mjolnir, Thor is helpless before the Destroyer.  Back in Norway, Sven steps back out of the fire, transformed into a fire demon, and tells the others that their master, Surtur, has arrived."

In the Woodrow Wilson Correction Facility just north of Syracuse, Loki, trapped in the body of Loren Olson, is about to be killed by some other inmates, when they are all frozen.  He beings looking around trying to figure out what has happened, when Karnilla appears before him, revealing that she is their source of their paralysis, and has come to free him.

In Asgard, Odin and the Asgardians are celebrating, when a hammer crashes into a pillar next to Odin.  The Warriors Three leap to the defense, only to stop short when they realize that it's Thor Girl.  She is enraged that Odin would let his son suffer like he is, and Odin tells her that he must suffer through his punishment on his own for turning his back on Asgard in the hour of its greatest need.  She turns and leaves, and just then, Volstagg bursts into the room and alerts Odin that their prisoner sounds awake.  At the same moment on Earth, the spiritform of Loki is looking for a victim to make use of Jake Olson's helplessness, and comes across Thor Girl, and decides she will be his assassin.  Later, inside the hospital, Sif and Jane are discussing Jake's condition, when the Destroyer bursts through the wall.  Hescamar, in his form as Marnot, manages to save Jake, and restore his godly form so that he can protect himself.  Jake then changes to Thor, and begins to battle the Destroyer until he discovers the spirit of Tarene is the one animating it.  Back in Norway, the fishing trawler has put into port, when one of the dock workers goes onboard to see where everyone is, and finds them all dead.  Except for Sven, who walks through the town with his eyes ablaze with fire, and the medallian around his neck."

The asteroid suddenly cracks, threatening to shower debris onto a rural village inNorway. Villagers panic as they run, but a woman points her daughter to Iron Man, expressing admiration and relief as he uses brute strength and repulsor blasts to shatter it into smaller pieces. At dawn, twoS.H.I.E.L.D.agents in hazmat suits collecting residual meteor nuggets pick up a piece in the countryside. One of them remarks on the village's fortune that no pieces fell on it, as they stand surrounded by the limp corpses of cattle, victims of radiation.\nLying on the ocean floor, Iron Man regains consciousness to the realization that he is still alive. Amassive florescent marine creaturebehind him telepathically expresses awkwardness, having almost eaten him. Tony's words appear distorted to the creature as it explains that he can simply think out his words and it will pick them up. Tony follows suit, but the massive fish rages defensively when Tony tells it to get away if it doesn't want to die. Stark squares up and thinks about shooting it with a repulsor beam, but the fish quickly rolls around facetiously, expressing resignation. Iron Man explains to the obtuse creature that he is not trying to kill it. Stark walks away in frustration, cautioning it about the radioactive asteroid fragment. The creature playfully acknowledges knowing its location, and extends its help.\nAs Tony and the enormous fish venture out together, the creature notices his glowing armor. He explains that his suit's thermocouple factor is on overdrive, pulling heat from the water to stay alive. The fish interrupts Tony to greet a passing group of sardines, calling them \"Freds,\" which are thinking out \"flee.\" Tony humors the creature as it explains that \"Freds\" have very simple thoughts, but that group seemed stuck on \"flee.\" A school of sardines swims toward them from the opposite direction. Iron Man prepares to fire a repulsor beam to create a path, but the giant fish assures him that they're harmless, unlike what they next walk into: a whale with glowing purple eyes preying on the sardines. Tony's companion draws his attention to the final piece of the asteroid, lodged in the whale's back, and it points out that it can either take lives or grant power. The whale turns around and uses a telepathic beam to call forth all \"Freds,\" including the enormous fish. Tony reaches out to it, but it explains that it used to be a Fred as well, until it was too mutated by the asteroid piece. Fred pleads Tony to take the asteroid piece and escape, surrendering itself to the fact that the strong feast on the weak, as such is the law of nature. In defiance, Iron Man propels himself toward the whale, delivering a punch so powerful that water erupts into the surface.\nThe whale reels from the blow, and Iron Man threatens it to leave. The creature taunts Tony's resolve, doubting that he can repeat such an attack. Tony holds steady, hoping the whale buys his bluff. It eventually does, and as soon as the whale turns around, Iron Man tumbles. Fred catches Stark and cradles him to the ocean floor. Tony explains to Fred that it is Mother Nature who stops his heart if his armor loses enough power, and that it was her who sent the asteroid for the fun of it. As he rests against a rock, Tony imparts to Fred that it is okay to rebel and defy nature to fight for one's survival or that of those one loves. He gestures to his chest plate as an everyday example of his conviction. Stark loses consciousness as his unibeam's glow dies out. Fred remarks that nature won this time, and swims away. Tony remains motionless, but a spotlight begins shining on him. Two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents wearing scuba suits approach Iron Man, noticing that he is still alive.\n• AYODELE and AKANDE continue their tour through IRON MAN's history in the second issue of this 60th Anniversary celebratory series.\n• Set during ARCHIE GOODWIN's classic era of Iron Man comics, Iron Man finds himself at the bottom of the ocean. It's dark down there, the pressure is maddening and giant sharp teeth stalk the shadows. How will Iron Man survive when nature itself wants him dead?"

While she finishes that, Odin goes to Midgard to rally his army. Back in New York, Amora steps through the Mirror while behind her back Keith watches her. He reveals himself to her, and begins to step through, and Amora is shocked at who he changes into. In Oslo, Thor Girl summons her power, and channels it into Thor, but it's not enough.  Odin rides forth, and taking Tarene's power into him, he combines it with his own and goes on a suicide run against Surtur, killing them both."

As he challenges her to identify himself, he remarks that she might be Loki trying to sneak past him. From nearby, Loki watches, chained to a tree by Odin, and snarls that he will yet get vengeance onThor.\nOn Earth, as nurse Jane Foster leaves Dr. Blake's office for an errand, she passes a wounded jewel thief and his two partners. They enter Blake's office and demand treatment. Distracting them, Blake taps his cane and transforms into Thor. Strapping the criminals to an operating table with surgical tape, he attaches it to his magic hammer and \"throws\" the criminals to the police station. He returns to the form of Blake just as Jane returns to the office.\nOne week later, Thor is helping with the filming of a Viking movie. He pretends to defeat a sea serpent while conjuring up a thunderstorm.  Loki, watching from Asgard, uses his magic to magnetically attract Thor's flying hammer to his uru chains, breaking them and setting him free.\nThor turns to Odin for help in finding his hammer. Transported to Asgard, Thor sets off in search of his hammer. When Loki uses his magic to attack Thor with giant trees, Thor makes a wooden hammer and fights them back. Next Loki sends a dragon against Thor. The Thunder God uses his finger to etch an imitation of his hammer from a nearby stone and drives back the dragon.\nRealizing that the stone from which he made his imitation hammer is uru, the same magical metal used to forge the original, Thor throws the hammer. He hopes the same magnetic forces which drew his real hammer will also draw the imitation. He follows the flying hammer to his own magic hammer, laying in the fragments of Loki's chains.\nInformed by Thor of Loki's escape, Loki is quickly recaptured by Odin, Heimdall and Frigga.\nBack on Earth, Dr. Blake prepares to use a rubber hammer on a patient's knee. As Jane assures the patient Dr. Blake is skilled with using a mallet, Blake thinks to himself that she does not know the half of it.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nEvents:\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nA showman's jealousy and cruelty to the circus' new attraction, a giant ape, leads to his doom when the ape, Monstro, takes his revenge!\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nA man lands on a planet where eating the native fruit transmogrifies you into a monstrous hulking creature.

He flies to a park in Brooklyn, and finds him there, but doesn't recognize him as Thor. He apologizes for his attack and introduces himself. He says that if Thor does not show, he will have to destroy the city. Thor does not identify himself, but states that he is a hero and will have to stop him. Fin Fang Foom challenges him and says that if the little hero can lift his foot, they will fly away for their battle to a deserted area. He does so and they fly off, followed by news helicopters. The dragon is impressed by the hero's feat, and out of respect, tells the little hero his true name - Jormungand. As the world serpent sheds his disguise, time around the world comes to a stop.

Thor finally introduces himself to his destined foe - Vingthor the Hurler, Longbeard's son, Hrodr's foeman, Feur, Hrungnir's playmate, Hloriddi, Thor Odinson, the Thunderer, Jormungand's fear!"

One, Lord Manzini, draws a white rock, and is locked in a room with the Kree monolith. While the others wait for him to return, the monolith swallows him.\nIn the present day, Coulson's team pulls Fitz out of the monolith's container before it can liquefy and swallow him. Fitz has sand on his finger that once dated is revealed to be a billion years older than the Earth. He comes to the conclusion that the sand must have come from some place the monolith is a portal to; some place that Simmons must be. Since the monolith has been studied for centuries, Coulson decides to have Professor Randolph, an Asgardian who's been living on Earth for centuries, help them study it. Before they leave, Hunter also leaves for his own personal time which he plans to use to take down Ward. Bobbi asks him to not die out there while Coulson asks he make sure Ward does. Coulson, Fitz and Bobbi go to Norway to find him in a Norwegian prison for damaging property while he was drunk. He rejects Coulson's offer, preferring to keep a low profile in light of all that's been going on in the world recently. But when Coulson threatens to tell the ATCU about him, Randolph rips the bars off his cell and leaves with them. Meanwhile, Dr. Garner arrives at the Playground to assess Joey Gutierrez. Daisy asks him if his ex-wife will ever come back from her vacation, but he only says she should ask her that instead.\nRandolph takes a look at the monolith and watches it collapse and take back its shape. He asks Fitz what would trigger its change. Fitz says it's completely random, but Randolph assures him it must be synchronized with something, even if it relates to another planet. Bobbi shows him the scroll that Fitz found in Morocco. Randolph recognizes the lettering from an English castle he visited in the 1850's. Coulson, Fitz, Randolph and Bobbi fly to England to investigate the castle. Inside, they find a secret passage that leads to a room with a large machine. They hear movement beneath them, and after tampering with the machine they uncover a hole in the middle of the floor filled with a black liquid. Fitz realizes the hole must have been used to hold the monolith. Coulson calls the Playground to tell Daisy and Mack to load up the Zephyr One and meet them there.\nFitz gets the machine running shortly after they arrive. The liquid reacts to the powerful vibrations the machine produces, but they also cause Daisy to collapse. Fitz shoots a flare into the liquid and watches it vanish. The machine falls apart before Fitz can conduct any more tests on it. Coulson helps Daisy recover, and she finds out no one heard the pulse but her. Fitz thinks the machine didn't activate the liquid, but that it's purpose was to vibrate the room at a frequency that would cause it to react, a frequency Daisy could probably use her powers to reproduce. After they stabilize the area, Daisy starts shaking the room. The liquid starts reacting again, and Fitz ties a cord around his waist and jumps in. He arrives on the windy alien planet and starts calling out to Jemma. Miraculously, she can hear Fitz and starts calling out to him. They crawl towards each other, but as they get close enough to touch Coulson orders his team to stop the test and pull Fitz out of there. He tries to stay on the planet long enough to grab Simmons. Daisy stops the vibrations, and the liquid erupts, covering the room in black dust. Fitz made it through the portal and sits up in the bottom of the pit, and pulls Simmons up with him. Some time later, Professor Randolph asks Coulson what Daisy is. When Coulson tells him they call themselves \"Inhumans,\" Randolph says he hasn't heard that word in a long time.\nMeanwhile, Agent May has been with her father in Arizona. He was recently injured in a hit-and-run that she thinks Ward might have been behind. While they are reminiscing about May's childhood, she sees someone outside come to the door. May grabs a knife, goes to the door, and before she can see who's there she grabs him and puts him in a hold. However, it wasn't some assassin there to kill her or her father, but Lance Hunter. He and May talk in the backyard about Hunter's plan to take down Ward. Since Ward never met him, Hunter plans on going undercover as a potential Hydra recruit. Although May is reluctant to get involved in Hunter's mission, she agrees to help him after talking with her father. She soon after gets a call from Andrew about Simmons' recovery, news that Hunter wants to celebrate over.\n[1]"

Believing that Thor is the cause of all this he goes searching for his brother and finds him frozen in a block of ice in Norway where he has just been discovered by archeologist Dr. Donald Blake. Loki attempts to destroy Thor then and there and finds that his magics are unable to do so. Blake, seeing the strange spectacle decides to call in SHIELD and the newly formed Avengers. Remembering the Avengers, Loki decides to go and seek them out and learn what his old foes are doing.\nSeeking them out he finds the newly built Avengers Island headquarters off the coast of Manhattan. Peering inside he witnesses as the Scarlet Witch is unpacking her room with her teacher Agatha Harkness. Loki detects that the Scarlet Witch is a powerful sorceress, and she manages to pick up Loki's presence even though Agatha cannot. Not wishing to be seen yet Loki would go onward. He'd enter the wrong of the Swordsman, and note how the hero is a narcissistic braggart. In the next room, he finds Hawkeye working out in a rigorous training schedule. In another room he finds Hellcat watching television until she is interrupted by the Vision. The Vision departs abruptly when Hellcat offers to try out a new massage technique on her.\nIn yet another room he finds the living legend of World War II, Captain America, scanning the Captains mind he learns that it is filled with much turmoil and strife. Elsewhere in the complex Nick Fury is showing government liaison Henry Gyrich around the island, listening to Gyrich's complaints that super-heroes should be outlawed not government sanctioned. Overhearing that the Avengers are waiting to go on their fist mission, Loki begins to realize that he is in some kind of alternate dimension that is different from the one he knows, but still decides to try and get revenge against his long hated foes. The argument between Gyrich and Fury is cut off when they are called by Donald Blake who shows them that he has found the long lost body of Thor the god of thunder.\nElsewhere in the complex, the Scarlet Witch meets with the Vision for the first time and she finds it a little creepy that he was deactivated part way through her conversation with him. Vision shows her around, and introduces her to his creator Dr. Henry Pym and his girlfriend Janet van Dyne, both part of the Avengers support staff. Janet is startled by Pym's newest creation Ultron-1, his new lab assistant since the Vision has joined active duty with the Avengers. The alarm sounds and soon the Avengers are deployed to Norway to investigate Blakes discovery.\nIn Norway, Blake shows the Avengers Thor, and his uncovered hammer, deciding to break Thor free from the ice, each of the Avengers attack separately and find that none of them can break through the ice. It takes a combination of Cap's shield, Visions phasing powers and the Scarlet Witch's hex magic to break the ice freeing Thor from his captivity. Realizing that Thor has been in ice for centuries and may simply just be a barbarian he orders the Avengers to stand ready for anything.\nLoki then takes the time to appear and convince the confused Thor that the Avengers are Thor's enemy leading to a battle between the Avengers and Thor. The Avengers prove no match for the combined strength and magic of Thor and Loki. However during the fight, Loki tries to strike down Thor with a bolt of magical energy, and is saved by Captain America. Finding his hammer, Thor picks it up and his memories return and he remembers that his brother is a trickster god and turns against him. With Loki distracted, the Scarlet Witch uses her hex powers to banish him away.\nWith the battle over, Captain America establishes that the Avengers are heroes and asks Thor what happened to him. Thor cannot recall, he remembers an onslaught and possibly Ragnarok but not much else. Realizing that having Thor's raw strength on the team could be a great asset to the group they invite the thunder god to join them, an offer which Thor agrees to take.\nWhile in the limbo realm that Loki has been banished too, the trickster god is confronted by Amora the Enchantress who agree to team-up and work with Loki as she has an interest in the Scarlet Witch, someone that the Enchantress claims is her daughter."

The hero had lost his powers and got them back with the help of a scientist, so he takes the duo to her labs.\nFour hours later, at Jack Pine,Wyoming, deep inside a wood, the three heroes reachRachna Koul's laboratories: she's the woman Ben has spoken toduring theFantastic Awardparty. She explains she works onimperiumology, which is biology in relation to superpowers, wherever they come from. She claims she can help Johnny, but for a price between 250.000 and 750.000$. As Johnny starts complaining about this, he also realizes she's currently \"curing\" the supervillainHydro-Man, meaning she doesn't care about the moral implications of her work, as long as she's being paid. Hydro-Man suddenly crashes his case and attacks the heroes, thinking Koul set up a trap for him. While he seems to manage himself around the three heroes, Dr. Koul stops him with her zeptoparticle-enhanced artificial hand and activating a machine that electrocutes the villain. Defeated, Hydro-Man is forced to get out from the \"back door\": the WC.\nNow that the threat is gone, Ben and Johnny try again to convince Koul to help them: they explain they need to travel theMultiverseto look for theirfamily, but she answers that multiversal travel is impossible. Ben replies that maybe another big brain like her could prove her wrong, as he shows her theMultisect, courtesy of Dr. Reed Richards. Koul is bewitched by the device, so she strikes a deal with the duo: she'll explain what's wrong with Johnny, as long as they take her with them on their journey. They agree, so she explains that, just as Hercules is tethered to a conduit of power, the Fantastic Four are tethered toeach other, meaning that prolonged periods of separation, especially in different universes, causes them to get powerless, and that applies to Ben as well.\nBack at the Mad Thinker's hideout, Doom inspects the scientist's devices and comes to the conclusion they are too imaginative to have been designed by him: he must have stolen them from Reed Richards' storage, which Julius doesn't deny. Doom threatens Julius saying he's not even close to being a good replacement for Reed, but Julius counters by teleporting Doom toAntarctica.

Afterward, he calls his fellow monks together, and announces that he needs to briefly depart theTower of Wisdom. He leaves them with two instructions. First, to meditate on the nearby stone cairns, which will outlast them all and yet possess no intelligence, and before which they are, to the universe, nothing. The second instruction is to remember to clean the latrines.\nAQuinjetarrives and swiftly carries him to an installation in Svalbard,Norway, above theArctic Circle. Here, he is greeted byPhil CoulsonandJemma Simmons, Agents ofS.H.I.E.L.D.. They have been told to refer to the monk asMagister Karnak. They have also been warned not to smile at him, as he will take this as an insult. Karnak, noting their restraint, smiles at them, then asks why he has been brought here. As he walks in, Coulson concludes that Karnak was trying to insult him.\nAs they enter, Coulson explains the meeting is taking place here due to recent security issues. In an office, Karnak is introduced toWilliamandSarah Roderick. Their sonAdamunderwent a traumaticTerrigenesisafterthe Builder War, and was recently kidnapped to an unknown location. Coulson wants to hire Karnak to recover Adam, in an apparent repeat of an arrangement they have had before. Karnak agrees, setting the condition that he has to train the boy before he lets him back into society. He asks a million dollars to find the child, to be made payable to his monastery, to aid in building. The price of the training; however, is that the Rodericks to give him the one thing which makes them believe the world is kind. As the Rodericks pause, Coulson calls Karnak outside.\nIn the hall, Karnak explains that he is doing this to the Rodericks because he is a teacher, trained from childhood to perceive the world as a collection of things - and people - that will fall apart if you hit them in the right place. His is a worldview that has no place forhumanfrailty, and if he can make them see that, they will be better for it.\nChanging the subject, Coulson lays out the facts: Adam Roderick was kidnapped by a terrorist group called I.D.I.C.,\"International Data Integration and Control\". AnA.I.M.splinter faction, they fell off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in recent years. They have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping via a video delivered to S.H.I.E.L.D. from a proxy server. This breach of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s security was what prompted the move to the Svalbard facility. However, the current legal directive to S.H.I.E.L.D. with regards toInhumansis that they can take no action to arrest or detain, as Inhumans are not human and therefore not subject to human laws. Thus Coulson's need to hire Karnak. Karnak regards the entire situation as ridiculous, and Coulson agrees with him.\nKarnak walks back into the office and demands that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent standing behind the Rodericks put his weapon down. When the agent instead draws his weapon and fires a bullet at Karnak, the magister hits the bullet in the exact fashion which breaks it in half and robs it of all horizontal momentum. Before the agent can fire again, Coulson enters the room and shoots the gunman in the right shoulder.\nKarnak explains that he knew the gunman was a traitor because he smiled at him, and then demands the name of the gunman's I.D.I.C. contact, before attacking the gunman with a series of precise strikes which destroy the gunman's liver and kneecap. The gunman acquiesces, saying he knows too little but begging for mercy. Karnak prepares to strike a killing blow, but Coulson holds him back, saying that medics have arrived. Karnak stands up, stating that he wants the address of the gunman's contact and then transport to that location. He also says that he will not tolerate Coulson holding him back again.\nLater, inBerlin, Karnak walks up to a rundown factory and punches in a steel loading door. Beyond it, a terror cell of men in gas-masks are startled by this, and reach for their weapons. They have no idea who they now face...\nTHE FLAW IN ALL THINGS"

However the Eventuality realizes that's not what the being in front of him is asking, he's asking more so on the limits of Venom the person as in the host. A Venom possessed Steve Rogers then reveals himself and asks the question of what it would look like for Captain America to possess the symbiote before showing us.\nThe Eventuality reveals to the being that was his way of showing that even if the symbiote possessed someone as powerful as Thanos, Kang, or Carnage that it may not be the end of the world like you'd think and maybe instead a basketball game. The being asks if the symbiote itself has limits to which the Eventuality reminds him he already answered that question but if he needs a reminder he'll take him to \"the end\".\nThe Eventuality then reveals that particular universe is cut off to him but he still likes to peak into it from time to time as he loves the \"end\" part of it. The being then calls the Eventuality out on his white lie as that universe's Eddie Brock does not eventually turn into the Eventuality and dies instead meaning not every Brock leads to him. The being asks what else he bent the truth on and the Eventuality decides to show him next.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nLocations:\nRaces and Species:\nDuring the time of King Harald Fairhair who broke his treaty with the people of Götaland, a young viking known as Anders Arnvidrson walks into a cave to seek vengeance. There he hears the voice of the symbiote who once helped and killed his people and killed his people's enemies and asks it for help. The symbiote accepts his request but not of course without scaring him into thinking he may die in the process only to reveal that while death will come it will not be his own.\nAs the king sails to Götaland they spot Anders and the king offers a ring of gold to anyone who can knock him into the water, they vikings immediately do so and then laugh and celebrate. However, their celebration is short lived as they are all dispatched and killed by Venom.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nCaptain Venom then goes to the Mini-Marvels universe where he asks the Eddie Brock and Venom of that universe to join his Elite Venom Team to help him. Eddie and Venom immediately begin to worry about which Multiversal threat it is this time, Thanos, Kang, or Carnage to which Captain Venom reveals it's none of them and that he just wants them to help him play basketball. Eddie is at first worried that this may break the space time continuum but Captain Venom puts his worries to side by informing him that the game is played by Multiversal rules. Eddie and Venom accept this and come to join Captain Venom only to find Thanos, Kang, and Carnage on the other side and panic, Captain Venom reveals there's no reason to panic as these are alternate versions of Thanos, Kang, and Carnage who mastered all their goals and then bonded to their universe's Venom symbiote (even the Carnage one).\nEddie asks Captain Venom why he needs him given they appear to have a stacked team and Captain Venom informs him that they needed 5 players. Eddie reminds Captain Venom that they seem to have already defeated every obstacle they've come across, Captain Venom then revels that despite passing every obstacle there are still issues they have yet to defeat that deal with basketball. The Carnage Venom attacks Eddie which Captain Venom calls \"clumsiness\" and an \"accident\" however Eddie and Venom don't believe that which Captain Venom mistakes for him supporting his teammate as Venom and Carnage Venom fight.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nDuring the end of their universe, the Starkware Dataform attempted to convince Venom to go into the Multiverse to save their universe believing that since the Multiverse was causing the destruction of their universe via incursions only it could save it. Venom, however, refused this and stated that in the Multiverse there is no such thing as one person as there is multiple of that supposed \"one person\" and therefore they would not use the Multiverse as it would be too confusing.

Desperate to know why the attack occurred, Thor, his brotherLokiand friends theWarriors ThreeandSiftravel to Jotunheim behind the AllFather's back.\nAt Jotunheim, the gods are greeted with an attack by Laufey's warriors, which is quickly halted when Odin arrives via Bifröst. As Laufey threatens a new war with Asgard, Odin banished Thor to Earth and casts a spell on Thor's hammerMjolnir, allowing only those worthy to be able to lift it.\nOn Earth, Thor lands in the path of Jane Foster's van and is then tasered by Darcy, proving to be mortal. While Thor befriends Jane on Earth, Loki discovers that he is actually the son of Laufey. When snapping at Odin about it, Odin collapses and falls into the Odinsleep, a process which allows him to recuperate his powers. Loki is proclaimed as acting King of Asgard and forbids Thor's return from his exile on Earth.\nJane agrees to help Thor reclaim Mjolnir whenS.H.I.E.L.D.agentPhil Coulsonhas her scientific research covered up and sent to a temporary base at the crater where the hammer landed. Thor fights off many agents but fails to lift Mjolnir. While imprisoned, Loki appears to him and tells him that Odin is dead, andFriggaforbids Thor's return. Loki also proves unworthy to hold Mjolnir. Selvig, although strongly disbelieving Thor's connections with Norse mythology, convinces Coulson to set him free. That night, Thor explains to Jane the cosmology of his dimension and accepts his place as a mortal.\nThe Warriors Three, Sif, and Heimdall conspire against Loki to bring Thor back, so Heimdall sends the four into New Mexico to find him, and is frozen in place by an angry Loki, holding the Casket. He sends the Destroyer to attack Earth. After the Warriors Three and Sif fail to defeat the Destroyer, Thor offers his life in exchange for Earth's safety. Stricken by the Destroyer's blow and near death, Thor earns worthiness to hold Mjolnir, which returns to him and restores his powers, which kill the Destroyer. Thor tells Coulson to consider him an ally of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Jane is allowed to complete her research under S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance.\nHeimdall breaks free of his icy state and Thor returns to Asgard, promising to return to Jane with a kiss. Loki allows Laufey into Odin's chambers as part of their pact but kills the Frost giant in an attempt to please his father. Thor and Loki battle at the Bifröst bridge, which has been activated by Loki to destroy Jotunheim. Thor chooses to destroy the bridge and sacrifice his chance to see Jane again. Odin wakes and saves Thor and Loki from falling into an abyss, but Loki lets himself fall, presumably to his death, when he realizes he has shamed his adopted father.\nThor and Heimdall discuss possible means of traveling to Earth without the Bifröst while Jane looks to have found a way, indicating Thor will soon find his chance to return.\nErik Selvig meets S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, who asks him to begin research on a powerful cube-shaped artifact.

They rush to attack it... only to be brought down by a hidden barrage of rayguns, which seems to kill them. In desperation,Black WidowsearchesWar Machine's armour for a weapon, but he gives her a gauntlet. Hoping it is a weapon, she tries to use it... and is immediately teleported to an Italian safehouse. This is interesting, as she knows she destroyed this safehouse and its stockpiles of gold years ago.\nThe gauntlet activates, playing from a set number of responses. It explains that it is a time machine, with a limited battery life and a list of co-ordinates worked into it. She asks if it can send her back to erase the events that brought her here, but it cannot perform an action which countermands existing events as the device knows them. She also needs to ensure the creation of the time machine itself. Stumped, Black Widow realizes what the device is trying to tell her - if she can arrange it so she controls everything going into the fight, she can change what happened after she left.\nGoing to Secret Avengers HQ the day before the mission, she asksHank McCoyfor advice. She travels back over forty years and uses gold from the safehouse to recruit\"Count\" Oscar Khronus, a scientist who robbed banks to fund his time travel research. She knew he would disappear this year, and it turns out she was the cause: with her money, he moves toSouth Americaand gives up on crime for pure research.\nMost of the rest of the money she takes to ten years ago and gives to a high-tech gunmaker namedHarry Grindell Evans- known as \"Death-Ray Evans\" for his love of cutting-edge science. She recruits him to design the weaponry the Shadow Council will use, and incorporate a flaw that she can exploit.\nThanks to a visit toDoctor Druid- less than a week before his untimely demise - she realizes that she will need to shut down the portal quickly, and takes the information back to Evans.\nOver a series of visits, spaced years apart, she sees Count Khronus' research progress, from time machines the size of buildings, to car-sized, to the very device she is currently using. Khronus' last act before dying was to program the gauntlet to the specifications she left them - specifications she has been using. She then uses blackmail to get the device placed on a list of DoD-approved additions to theWar Machine armorin the months before the mission.\nThe penultimate part of the task comes when she brings Death-Ray Evans to the safehouse. He assures her that he has built the weapons she wanted, then sold them to her enemies. He hands her a counter-device. It will reduce the effectiveness of the lasers to 'stun' devices. A second function of the device will interfere with the portal, leading ultimately to an explosion. It is one-use only. He wonders why she brought him here, and she explains that in a few hours, her present-day self will decide the safehouse is compromised and detonate it by remote control. She incapacitates Evans and escapes with the device. Evans comes to in time to die in the explosion.\nOn the day of the mission, Black Widow arrives a little early and gets comfortable. Using the device's first function, she saves her friends, then watches herself teleport away. Then she activates the second function, and throws away both the wasted time machine and the one-use detonation trigger.\nThe day is saved. Black Widow seems tired. Oher than that, it is a routine mission.\nRUN THE MISSION! DON'T GET SEEN! SAVE THE WORLD!\n• The Secret Avengers are all dead save for the Black Widow."

His attacker, introducing himself as Apocalypse, explained that he was acting to safeguard the future. When Thor attacked again, he discovered that Apocalypse was wearing armor capable of withstanding his godly might. He departed for Asgard.\nApocalypse returned to his current base, a Celestial-built floating pyramid, in which his old enemy Pharaoh Rama-Tut was resting. The Pharaoh had informed him that in the future a small number of people will disrupt his plans, and that they or their ancestors must be killed. Apocalypse demanded the next name. Irate, the pharaoh acquiesced: Folkbern Logan.\nIn Asgard, Thor arrived and demands an audience with his father. Odin explained that Apocalypse answered to the Celestials, and wore their armor. The Celestials wrung a non-agression treaty from the gods of Earth when last they came. When Thor demanded Odin help him anyway, Odin asks him to take the high road. As Thor left, he asked Loki for help, and Loki led him to a hidden scroll in Odin's library, which could bless a weapon to pierce Celestial armor - if the blessing is cast by Odin or his blood kin. Acknowledging his thanks, Thor departed... only for \"Loki\" to be revealed as Kang the Conqueror, Rama-Tut's future self.\nIn London, Folkbern Logan, the last pagan in London, was on guard duty against Norse raiders, when his guard position was attacked by the Horsemen of Apocalypse. As his friend died, Folkbern prayed for deliverence, and his prayer was answered by the arrival of Thor, who promptly slew the attackers. Apocalypse complains that Rama-Tut never warned him of this. Rama-Tut acknowledged the accusation and teleports away. Apocalypse vowed revenge, but he had other matters at hand: if his enemy's ancestor lived in London, he would burn down London to kill him.\nThor broke into the craft and accused Apocalypse of cowardice. Apocalypse managed to wound the god with his own axe, but Thor got the upper hand and cut the armor open. Stunned, Apocalypse said that Thor had cheated, but vowed to kill him with an explosion. Thor escapes, leaving a spectacle in the London sky, and confusion in the hear of Folkbern Logan.\nThat night, in Asgard, Thor boasted of his victory, only to be accused of childishness by Odin. The spell performed on the axe was no blessing, but a curse on Thor forevermore. In his search for petty revenge on Apocalypse, Thor had doomed worlds. Odin only hoped that Thor would one day learn from his mistakes.\nIn the present day, in the final resting place of Baron Mordo in Brazil, Kang appears to take the axe Jarnbjorn. It seems he has a plan.\nThe Apocalypse Twins Part 1\n• New regular artist Daniel Acuña joins just in time for Thor vs Apocalypse in the 11th Century! Wait until you see these two titans first meeting and first battle!\n• The Avengers’ ancestors are being hunted and only a young Thor can save his future companions!\n• And with Rama Tut and Kang pulling the strings, you know nothing good can come from any of it."

Thor will travel to Midgard, and join a Viking expedition to the new world. He will not have his power and will be forbidden to use Mjolnir. If he fails, he will be exiled to Midgard forever and give up all claim to the throne. If Loki loses, he will exile himself to Jotunheim, also forever. Of course, Loki has plans to cheat to ensure that he wins.\nOn Midgard, Thor travels to a fishing village in Norway and goes to the local inn where he, calling himself Sigurd, claims the last berth available on an expedition that is about to set sail for the New World in search of treasure. Meanwhile, Loki send his astral self to Greenland where he finds a long-deserted Atlantean outpost and prepares it for Thor and the expedition by setting deadly magical traps.\nAs the five Viking ships make their slow way across the North Atlantic, Sigurd finds himself beside Baldric. As they work together and compete with each other, Sigurd and Baldric become fast friends, and the now-mortal Thor gains respect for his new friend who matches him task for task.\nEventually, Loki begins his plot by secretly conjuring forth a fierce storm that sinks two of the five ships and drowns many of the men. Sigurd and Baldric help rescue others and pull them aboard their ship. Thor knows that he could end the storm and save the lives of the brave men but believes he cannot because doing so would forfeit the wager and enable Loki to one day rule Asgard. Thor realizes that it is because of his pride that these men are dying, but he must think of his duty to Asgard and the All-Father first.\nLater, after the storm has subsided, land is sighted and a landing party is sent ashore to forage for food. Spotting the fairly-advanced ruins nearby, the interest that Sigurd and Baldric show in them causes the captain to appoint them as the leaders of a group who are to check out the ruins.\nIn Asgard, the Warriors Three and Balder speak with Odin, informing him of the wager that Thor made and of their suspicions that Loki may be cheating. They ask permission to join Thor on Midgard but Odin refuses their request, declaring that Thor has sown the wind and shall reap the whirlwind.\nIn the ruins, Sigurd and the Vikings follow a corridor that leads only downwards. After hearing what sounds like scratching being made by large rats, some of them enter a small room and a door falls shut behind them, separating the party. Sigurd and Baldric and the others within the room are then attacked by giant rats who kill or injure some of them. Although tempted to regain his powers, Thor decides to fight like a man. Spotting water dripping from the ceiling, Sigurd realizes that there is a cistern above and that the leaking water may have loosened the mortar holding the stones in place. Sigurd manages tp pull a large stone loose and use it to batter a rat but then the water unleashed through the hole sweeps over the magically-enlarged rats and they disintegrate. After appointing Johannsen to stay with the wounded, Sigurd, Baldric and two others leave to search for a way out for them all. Since the only passage leads down, they descend to another chamber whose walls are lined with crypts. As Baldric inspects one of them, looking for treasure, the mummy within animates and attacks him, and the other mummies join in. The Vikings manage to all survive until one of them takes advantage of a moment when Baldric is distracted and stabs him in the back. Baldric soon dies in Sigurd's arms, causing Sigurd to battle even more fiercely to avenge his friend's death and inspiring the other two Vikings as well. Seeing that his undead warriors are going to be defeated, Loki casts a spell of transformation on a small lizard that turns it into a dragon that Thor knows is extinct everywhere except in Jotunheim. Realizing that this means that Loki has violated the terms of the wager, Thor feels free to act and uses Mjolnir to again become the mighty Thor who soon ends the threat of the dragon. Seeing that the Vikings are now worshipping him, Thor tells them that their courage and nobility has earned them the right to stand as his equals.\nOnce back in Asgard, an enraged Thor bursts into Odin's hall to confront Loki and prepares to send him to join his daughter in Hel. However, Odin stays his hand and states that Thor's pride and arrogance were as much to blame for what happened as Loki's dishonorable behavior. When Loki points out that the mortals had shown nobility and courage equal to his own, Thor is shamed by Loki's words and releases him. As Loki quickly leaves, Thor speaks of how he is certain that a soul as noble and courageous as Baldric must even now be enjoying the pleasures of Valhalla where the feasting never ends and the treasure is without limit."

Simmons ducks a call from her concerned parents, while Coulson laments that Thor never sticks around after the destruction, and Skye expresses her excitement and intrigue of learning about the Asgardians as alien beings. Elsewhere in a Norway national park, a couple follows directions to a mysterious tree, chopping it down to find an Asgardian staff that grants the woman rage-filed strength by touching it, which she then uses on a park ranger.\nLater at the scene, Ward helps Simmons through her reticence to investigate the downed tree, using her tech to create a 3D model of the staff for Fitz to print out. The analysis reveals the artefact as Asgardian, while Skye sees over the news that the couple, Petra Larsen and her boyfriend Jakob, have been connected to several ongoing Norway riots as part of a Norse hate group. In order to identify the item, Coulson suggests they contact the same professor he used for Thor’s hammer, a man named Elliot Randolph.\nCoulson visits the professor in Spain, who identifies the artefact as one of three pieces of the Berserker staff, a rage and strength-inducing weapon used by an Asgardian army long ago. The warrior who used the staff supposedly elected to remain on Earth, and hid its three pieces around the world, though the manuscripts leave dubious clues as to their location. Several investigations fail to bear fruit, though Skye eventually tracks another potential location to a church, coincidentally in Seville.\nWard and Skye investigate the ruins of the old church, where Ward encounters Professor Randolph attempting to abscond with the staff piece himself, though touching the item forces Ward to double over in pain. Randolph manages to escape, as Skye quickly finds that Ward is not himself, seeing flashes of a boy in a well. Outside, Randolph encounters the hate group, who manage to overpower him and take the staff piece before Coulson arrives to intervene.\nSimmons tests an increasingly irate and snippy Ward, while Coulson learns little from interrogating Randolph, with the professor claiming he merely wanted to study the artefact before S.H.I.E.L.D. could lock it away. Ward angrily shrugs off Skye’s questions about the memory flashes pertaining to his brother, while Simmons dismisses his actions as an adrenaline spike. Ward attempts to work through the anger with a punching bag, continually seeing images of the boy struggling in the well, as May offers to lend a hand in quelling his rage. Elsewhere, Jakob and Petra continue building an army by recruiting others to touch the staff.\nWard admits to Coulson that he feels compromised by the staff, and the painful memories it dredges up, but Coulson wonders if they might put his aggression to good use in interrogating Randolph. Ward enters the room to begin his questions, drawing a knife to the man in anger, though Randolph easily deflects and destroys the blade, revealing himself as the Asgardian in the story. Randolph admits to never liking the power that came with the Berserker staff, abandoning his lowly Asgardian life to live on Earth throughout the ages, accidentally recording his own myth. He refuses to reveal the location of the third piece of the staff but relents when Coulson reveals that he knows Thor and threatens to end his anonymity. At the very least, Randolph admits to storing the third section of the staff in a monastery in Ireland.\nArriving in the emerald isle, Randolph assures Ward that his rage will subside eventually, though the staff has a way of shining a light on unpleasant memories, in Ward’s case his first experience with hatred. The group arrive to the monastery and find the piece’s hiding place, but not before Jakob and his forces have arrived, having tortured the resident priests into giving up its location, stabbing Randolph in the heart and forcing Ward to fuel up on rage again to fight the group. Jakob and Ward battle it out on the monastery floor, while Fitz and Simmons attempt desperately to save Randolph’s life, Coulson plunging his hands into the Asgardian’s chest to stop the bleeding, and start his advanced healing.\nDuring the fight, Ward relives the full memory from his youth, revealing himself not as the boy in the well, but as a boy up top whose brother bullied him into withholding a rope from the drowning youth. Back in the present, Ward allows May to take over, assembling the full staff as she fights off Petra, before ridding herself of the artifact without difficulty. Upstairs, Randolph regains consciousness and tells Simmons that she's the most beautiful woman he's seen in a thousand years.\nNext morning, while Simmons finally accepts a call from her parents, May admits to Ward that she relives some of her worst memories daily, hence the staff had little effect on her. Coulson ponders picking up the staff, admitting his death and resurrection to Randolph, before advising the outed professor to move to Portland for a means to stay out of the limelight. He also suggests introducing Randolph to Thor next time he's in town. That night, Ward apologizes for his behavior with Skye, returning upstairs to his hotel room, before accepting an invitation to join May for a drink in hers.\nThe Wellat Marvel Movies Wiki"

In both the form of Thor and Donald Blake, the Thunder God ponders the paradox of his life, that of being both a mortal and a God, and begins to recount the events that led to how Donald Blake came to become Thor:\nThis issue then reprints Thor's debut appearance inJourney Into Mystery#83..\nDonald Blake, a doctor from the United States, is visiting Norway. At the same time, a ship from Saturn lands nearby as advance scouts for a planned invasion. A local fisherman spots them and alerts the villagers, but they dismiss him. Blake overhears and goes to look for himself. When he steps on a twig, the aliens notice him. He flees into the hills, where he loses his cane. He runs into a cave, but the other entrance is blocked by a giant boulder. A secret door opens, revealing a chamber where Blake finds a walking stick. He tries to move the boulder with the stick but is unable to get the leverage. Frustrated, he hits the boulder with the stick, and in a flash of light, the stick transforms into a hammer, and Blake transforms into Thor, the mythical Norse God of Thunder.\nThor easily lifts the boulder and leaves the cave. He verifies that the hammer has all the powers of Mjolnir, Thor's legendary weapon. Meanwhile, the alien armada shows up on Earth's radar screens. When fighter jets scramble to meet them, they project an image of a huge dragon and frighten away the pilots. When the ground forces fire missiles, they explode harmlessly the ships' force fields. Thor speeds to the defense of the Earth.\nWhen Thor attacks the aliens they drop a cage over him but he tears the bars open. They aim their disintegration beams at him, but his hammer smashes their guns. They unleash their Mechano-Monster, but he smashes it to bits. The aliens return to their ships and give up their invasion. Thor changes back to Dr. Blake, whom the soldiers ignore when they come to look for the invaders.\nFollowing this recounting, Donald Blake begins to think about his further adventures and how they eventually brought him to the fabled realm of Asgard, where his life would never be the same again. He recalls his meeting with Odin, the All-Father, and meeting his allies Balder, Hercules and the Warriors Three, and also recalls his battles against such foes as Loki, Karnilla, the Destroyer, Pluto, Cobra and Ulik.\nFinally, Blake thinks back of the two loves in his life, his lost and former love Jane Foster, the nurse who worked for him in the early days of his career as Thor, and his new lover the goddess Sif. With his recollections over with, Blake begins to wonder who he really is: Donald Blake or Thor? And if he is really Donald Blake, a mere mortal granted with the power of the Thunder God, what happened to the original?\nThis story is continued next issue..."

They implant the alien virus into a willing intern, who quickly dies. Hyperion and Captain Marvel arrive to confront them, with Hyperion mentioning that it was AIM who saved him from his own dying universe.\nIn a flashback we see the destruction of his original world due to an incursion event that collapsed two universes together. Hyperion somehow survived, floating in an interdimensional void, when AIM scientists discovered him and pulled him into our reality. They kept him prisoner until he was rescued by Cap, Iron Man, and Thor.\nIn the present, the AIM scientists say they have diplomatic immunity from the Avengers; things are about to escalate when the dead intern’s body suddenly sprouts tentacles and begins attacking everyone. Thor and Hyperion destroy the creature and Captain Marvel asks an AGENT why they would inject a human with the alien virus; he responds that they were curious. Nearby Hyperion observes several pods opening; small, striped humanoids emerge who speak in the Builders’ language. Instead of destroying them he chooses to let them gather around him.\nAs he is taken into custody, the AIM scientist smirks at Captain Marvel, congratulating her sarcastically on containing all 6 impact sites. In Norway, a group of AIM scientists locate a hitherto unknown seventh impact site."

He's recovered from his burns but he still has a fractured arm and jaw.  She has him change into Thor so she can examine him as well, and the injuries are still the same.  Outside the exam room, Mr Ryan, Hannah, Amanda, Keith, and Christine are all waiting word on how he is.  Keith insists on going in until Tarene shows up and tells him that he shouldn't go in.  Jake's mother doesn't know who Jake's \"cousin\" Tarene is, which Amanda finds suspicious.  Keith opens the door, and Tarene's powers create the illusion that it's just Jake inside and not Thor. Jane tells Thor that the best place for him to be examined is back in Asgard, and so he transports them there. In Norway, Surtur is on a rampage, and his human-turned-fire demon slaves continue converting others.  In Asgard, Balder and Odin discuss the Destroyer, with Odin contemplating on whether he should just finally destroy it, but Balder tells him that they will one day need it. Jane and Thor arrive, and Odin calls in his healers Cyra and Neffethesk.  Cyra goes to prepare the casts, but Neffethesk tells her to wait, that his injuries would heal quicker if he will agree to be immersed in the Elixirs of Renewal. Odin agrees to enchant the Elixirs of Thor will agree to the treatment. Thor is concerned about Jake Olson, people back on Earth are getting suspicious and Mr Ryan is about to fire him again.  Odin uses his power to separate Thor from Jake so that Thor can be healed and Jake can tend to personal matters. When Jane and Jake return to Earth, he goes out to reassure everyone that he's okay. When his mom asks about Tarene, Jake tells her that he's cousin Eddie's little girl and she hasn't seen her since she was a baby. Back in Asgard, Thor prepares to bathe in the Elixirs of Renewal, before he goes under, he warns Balder that he saw the Enchantress and to be wary. As soon as he is immersed and under the spell, Fandral bursts into the room, and warns them that Surtur is loose on Earth.  Odin sends his warriors to Earth to battle Surtur and his Fire Demons, and summons Hercules, Kurse, and Beta Ray Bill to fight by their side in the absence of Thor. Using so much of his power so quickly to give life to Jake, empower the Elixirs, and dispatch entire armies to Midgard has weakened Odin and he is unable to help further."

Despite setbacks such as riots from angry New Yorkers, mysterious \"accidental\" fires, and a worker murdering the foreman under the influence ofMephisto, the Ravencroft Institute for the Criminally Insane was finally completed. One of the Institute's early inmates was the time-displacedSir PercyofScandia, Jonas dismissing his claims of having been sent to the future byMorgan Le Fayas a delusion. One of his employees, a Romanian doctor namedClaudia Russell, suggested they treat Percy's claims seriously and returnhis sword, but she was dismissed by Jonas and her colleague Dr. Nathanial Essex. In his journal, Jonas notes that while he found Dr. Essex's logic sound there was something disturbing about him, and that in time he would discover just how sinister Dr. Essex was.\nSometime later, Dr. Essex's hired thug,Victor Creed, stands over the lobotomizedJames \"Logan\" Howlett, wondering whether his longtime nemesis is the serial killer dubbed the \"Knickerbocker Knifer\" by theDaily Buglenewspaper before deciding that he couldn't care less. As Creed gloats that he's butchered people - including his own siblings - Dr. Essex enters the cell and reprimands him not to tamper with his new specimen - one he's wanted to acquire for some time. As Dr. Essex saws off one of Logan's arms, Creed cheerfully remarks that anything he had planned for Logan couldn't be worse than what Dr. Essex has planned.\nSneaking into Logan's room, Dr. Russell laments that his deplorable condition is her fault for looking the other way regarding Dr. Essex's highly unethical treatment of his patients. As she tries to carry Logan to safety, vowing to never let another patient be brutalized, Dr. Russell is attacked by Creed. Slapping Logan's face, Creed sneers that she shouldn't make promises she can't keep, especially when they involve herself. Dr. Russell snaps that Creed doesn't scare her, but he gleefully remarks that since he can't have her interfering with Dr. Essex's experiments, he intends to do more than frighten her.\nRegaining consciousness, Logan attacks Creed in a berserk rage and impales him through the lower jaw with his claws. As Creed flings him off, Dr. Russell remarks on Logan's regenerative abilities and urges him to run. Revealing his own healing abilities, Creed lunges at Dr. Russell and mockingly asks if she can say the same about herself. Transforming into awerewolf, Dr. Russell reveals that she is the real Knickerbocker Knifer - having been unable to control her bestial form's predatory urges during the full moon. Snarling that Creed's death won't be an accident, Dr. Russell pounces on him and slams him into a wall. Before she can do anything further, Dr. Essex stabs her in the neck with a syringe. As she collapses, he remarks that this was an unexpected development and that he loathes surprises.\nIn his journal, Jonas notes that the next morning he received a letter from Dr. Russell announcing her resignation and that she was returning to her native Romania. Noting that while the letter was in her writing and returning to her homeland was something she had discussed in the past, Jonas nevertheless felt that something seemed off about it, that something terrible had happened to Dr. Russell, and that Dr. Essex was responsible.\nIn his hidden laboratory, Dr. Essex and Victor Creed vivisect Dr. Russell, Jonas noting that from that day on his trust in Nathanial Essex ended, as did Essex's reign of terror over the Ravencroft Institute; however, Jonas lamentingly writes that Essex wasn't the last monster to enter his facility.\nIn the present, Mister Fantastic, Misty, Jameson, and Fisk are confronted by a horde of grotesquely deformedvampiresthat burst through the floor. As Fisk recoils in horror, stammering that this can't be possible after all this time, Jameson transforms intoMan-Wolfand lunges into the fray, saying that the best way to fight a monster is with another monster. Misty and Mister Fantastic note that the grotesque vampires have the upper hand through numbers and the group retreats through the door. As Fisk forces the door shut with help from Mister Fantastic and Man-Wolf, Misty notes that he looked like he'd seen a ghost - or that the ghost had seen him. Fisk irritably tells her that if she intends to make an accusation she should do so, but that otherwise she should choose her words carefully or risk making him a powerful enemy."

In a medium bowl, combine the chipotle, lime juice, olive oil, cilantro, and salt to make a marinade for the pork chops. Use either a stick blender, food processor, or stand-up blender to mix ingredients until smooth.2. Pour the marinade over the pork in a bowl, making sure they're completely covered. Then set them aside in the fridge and prepare the other ingredients. Marinading overnight may help to maximize flavor.3. In a small bowl, combine the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, and salt and briskly mix them together with a whisk (with a whisk or stick blender) until the sugar is fully dissolved.4. On a clean cutting board, split a head of cabbage in two. Then remove the core and stem and julienne the leaves, which means cutting it into thin slices. You'll need about a handful of cabbage per sandwich. And now, while working with vegetables, pick cilantro and mint leaves, about 8 each per sandwich, and rinse them in cold water to serve as a topping later.5. Split the avocado in half lengthwise, remove the pit and use a large spoon to scoop out the inside, slice them and put them aside.6.Optional:For add heat, add pickled jalapeños, which are super simple to make. Thinly slice some jalapeño peppers, or any chilis really, put them in a jar and cover with champagne vinegar or rice vinegar then refrigerate.7. Now set up your breading station for the pork chops, going left to right: first flour then beaten eggs (3-4 eggs is probably perfect for 4 pieces of pork) and panko bread crumbs for the final stage. Normal bread crumbs are fine if your local store does not carry panko. Make sure you keep a clean plate or tray at the end of the station where you can place each of your breaded pork loins with no overlap.8. One by one, lift each piece of pork chop out of the marinade and shake off much of the excess liquid as you can with one hand. Then place the chop in the flour and using your dry hand, make sue the pork is completely covered in flour. Then, also with your dry hand, take the now floured pork and place it into the egg wash. This time, use your wet hand to coat the floured pork entirely in the egg, then gently move it into the panko, using your dry hand to firmly coat the pork with bread crumbs. Once it's nicely crusted, move it to the holding tray. Then repeat these steps until all the pork chops are coated.9. Pour about 2 inches of oil into a pot with high enough walls so then when you add the pork chop, it won't overflow. Heat the oil and test if it's ready by dropping a few panko flakes in; if they sizzle and fry up quickly, you're good to go. Using your chopsticks or tongs, lay the pork into the oil, being careful not to splash.10. Then let the pork chop fry, checking each one until it's golden brown on the underside. Then, very carefully, turn the pork over and finish flying until it's crisp and brown on both sides. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes per side. Once done, remove pork and place each chop on a plate or trap lined with paper towels to absorb the oil and immediately season them with salt and pepper.11. While the pork is resting, in a small nonstick pan, heat up a tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of butter until they start to foam. Then crack an egg into the pan. When the egg whites are set and firm on one side, flip the egg and cook it until the other side sets, finishing with salt and pepper. Eggs should always be cooked to taste so the choice is yours, but runny is recommended.\nLayering the torta\n12. While you're frying your egg, feel free to slice and warm your bun in an oven or toasted oven until it's crisp and brown.13. Spread mayonnaise on each side of your toasted bun. Then add sliced avocado and season with whatever spices you may like.14. Place your pork on top of the avocado and generously slather it with tonkatsu sauce. Don't be afraid to get messy! The fried egg then goes on top, and we top it all off with a nice layer of cabbage, some mint, and cilantro. Finish with your pickled jalapeños if you made them.15. You can wrap your sandwich with wax paper or foil so it's easy to transport or you can just cut it right on a plate. There you go...a totally tremendous torta!"

Scared,Kentahugs his parents.\nJada approaches Steve as he sits dejected at the steps of theTreehouse. She offers him a cup of coffee and sits next to him. They talk about idealism untilNightcrawlerinterrupts them to take Steve to the North Pole to confront the Progenitor. The mutant psychics broadcast to the entire world as Captain America stands up against the Progenitor. The godly creature looks down as Steve decries it and spurs the world on to keep fighting, declaring the entire world asAvengers. The Celestial replies by sending down a lightning bolt that incinerates him and Kurt in an instant. As Nightcrawler returns to life inKrakoa,Jean Greyinforms him that the broadcast managed to defuse the worldwide chaos, and that the anger of the people is now directed against the Progenitor. The Eternals and Iron Man convene with theProfessor Xand theWar Captains, and plan to attack the Progenitor on its weak point. In order to prevent the Eternals from engaging their principle to protect Celestials, they agree to turn off their psychic firewalls so that the mutant psychics can take them over.Destinystates that this is their only chance, with certain modifications.\nIron Man leads the charge against the Progenitor, as the Avengers, the Eternals, including theHex, and the mutants are joined by Earth's other heroes, such asSpider-Manand theFantastic Four, and evenDoctor Doom, as well as the human military. The military's fire distracts the Progenitor long enough for the Hex to get close. The Celestial's counterattack, in turn, leaves it open for a riposte from a group of heroes. The heavy-hitters such asIkaris,ExodusandCaptain Marvel, attack all at once, exposing the Progenitor for a final blow fromThor. However, the Progenitor burns them all to death, and the Hex similarly fall. Turning its attention to the assortment of heroes, the Progenitor kills them all in different ways. In distress, Iron Man orders a retreat of the remaining forces.\nThe Progenitor continues making the Earth burn. It spots a spaceship populated by the elite trying to escape the planet, and it shoots it down. It destroys theResurrection Enginesand Krakoa as well, killing numerous mutants, includingEggand Destiny. A few survivors escape to theAvengers Mansionwith a handful of resurrection eggs. Nightcralwer ascertains something Destiny had mentioned, that as long as they left certain people in Krakoa, the Celestial would assume it killed them all. He states that they can evacuate anyone else, but only have a limited supply of eggs. Phastos warns that the Progenitor is integrating with theMachine That Is Earth. AsWolverinereturns to life from an egg in the kitchen, Nightcralwer asks for his input in taking a discreet approach against the Progenitor, but Logan defers toJack of Knives.\nIron Man, Jean Grey, Ajak, Makkari, Sersi, Mister Sinister, Jack of Knives and Wolverine gather on top of a teleportation platform, with Phastos granting Grey personalized firewall access to Ajak, Makkari and Sersi in case the principles start interfering. They are teleported to the North Pole and enter the Progenitor while cloaked through an aperture in its heels. However, they're quickly detected. Jack of Knives runs outside to distract the Progenitor, and is killed. Jean telepathically contacts the Avengers Mansion, asking they buy the strike team every second they can. In the kitchen, Exodus protests asProteusprepares to use an egg, arguing thatCyclopsshould be resurrected instead. Nightcrawler agrees that Cyclops is a great leader, but not who the Earth needs right now. The remainingFiveactivate the egg, and Captain America's arm bursts out of it, sportinghis shield."

Then\nBrian comes home from work, and steps on a toy brick his son, Bruce, left on the floor while playing. A glass of whisky in his hand, Brian shouts at Bruce he should stop leaving toys around. Rebecca tells him to calm down, to not snap at Bruce, but Brian does not listen. He takes the box which contained the bricks Bruce is playing with, and reads that it is a complex educational toy for kids of twelve or more. Bruce is not even six, and he's not using the instructions. Brian knows what Bruce is, he knows exactly. He is a disgusting little monster that changed Brian's Rebecca. She's not happy anymore, because of him.\nBrian shouts that he'll go to his study, and orders Bruce to pick up the mess. Rebecca tells him to do like his father told him, and leaves, saying she needs time alone to think. Bruce is scared, but more of that he is angry. So angry he starts shouting: \"Smash! Smash!\" and holding the glass his father dropped to the floor, he destroys the toy city he built.\nBelow\nHulk is enraged: after destroying the Red Hulk, he keeps attacking everything in his sight. He will crush everything, kill everything. Jackie is afraid, but with a lot of courage steps up and touches the Hulk, calming him down. The Hulk cries: why he always must hurt? Jackie cannot answer him, but asks him to let the other Hulk, the \"devil\" one, come out. He accepts, and the Immortal Hulk comes back, thanking her: the big boy stays inside usually these days, but when he gets really angry he gets out.\nJackie asks to Hulk how much time passed since he's been in charge of the whole personality system. He does not give a straight answer: somebody has to. In the night, it is him. In the day, well, day is Banner's time. Jackie asks where Bruce is, and Hulk answers he does not know, but has a hunch, looking to the green beacon on the cliff above.\nAnd Bruce Banner is in fact inside that light, with Brian on his side: the father speaks to the son, explaining his life to him. He grew up with Bruce's grandfather, and thought that there was no love suited for him. That Brian Banner was not worthy of love. But then, he met Rebecca, and she did love him. A miracle. He was brilliant in those times, a respected scientist in the field of radiation, especially Gamma. He had a theory...\nHe studied the unpredictable behavior of Gamma Radiation, and found out that the energy could manifest not in two, but three forms. Particle, wave, and another, mysterious. His colleagues kept telling him he was nonsense, but they were intrigued. They respected him for the theory. And this led him to push himself to the limit to find out what that third energy was, so he kept studying and looking. Nothing happened.\nOne time, he stayed up. It was night, he was tired and he drifted off: something in his dreams appeared to him. A creature looking through a Green Door, separating the world from a \"cellar-world\" beneath all creation.\nHe thought he was going mad because of fatigue, and abandoned the research. His colleagues started losing their respect for him, and also, when he came home, Rebecca told him she was pregnant. Brian knew what was happening: he knew what Bruce was. Bruce took all the love of Rebecca for himself, depriving Brian of it. And then, he killed Brian on his mother's own grave. Yes, Bruce, his son...\nBut no, Brian must remember: it was not Bruce, but the monster who cast him down to hell.\nAnd when Brian tried to protest the injustice that was done at his expense, the monster cast him farther down, here, Below. And Below, the thing from Brian's dreams finally appeared to him. Creation's secret reflection, Gamma's third form. And this thing, it could not manifest in our world directly: it needed a host to do his deeds. First it was Brian, but then something better. Brian's Immortal son, loaded with the third form of Gamma energy, able to open the Green Door after the bomb he triggered in his infamous experiment exploded. And that son, that son can set Brian free...\nNoon is approaching in Hell, tells Brian: it will appear. And then, green clouds assemble into a gigantic creature speaking with an indescribable voice. It is the One Below All. Jackie is terrorized, and tells Hulk they are too late: who can fight something like that? He is the end.\nBut Hulk answers: that thing is not the end of the world. And why does he know it? Because the end of the world is what Hulk is.\n“HULK IN HELL” PART TWO!\n• It whispers through many mouths. It destroys with many hands. Its only weapon is hate.\n• It wears human souls like masks on a stage to work its will on the world — but in the lowest hell, underneath all others, all the masks come off..."

Not wanting to waste more time, May inquires on Otto's device which he explains will catalogue the radiation signatures of the scene of theU-Foes's attack onEmpire State University. At the impact crater, May finds a shred of fabric nonconforming to fashion with Peter's collegiate contemporaries. With their samples on scene too degraded for field study, they take the fabric for examination at Otto's Safe House #32B, where Otto attempts to be suave while the analysis processes. But before taking another path of investigation, May voices her want to find Peter a cure while Otto voices his goal of helping and protecting her to the best of his ability.\nWith the analysis complete, Otto finds a rare air pollutant found exclusively in the industrial district alongside a specific type of radiation. Uncertain of who they'll find, Otto dons his mechanical tentacles attached with an omni-sensor to recreate the needed radiological elements for their research. Arriving at the location, an apartment complex, May uses the call button to ask building superEricto allow her and her \"husband\" to check out a room; her maternal dialogue earning an easy entry. Inside, Otto deduces that the room was used by the U-Foes and Eric informs him that a company namedInfinite Solutionscleaned it up immediately afterwards. When May finds a clue with the Omni-Scanner, Otto explains how they'll need a larger sample for a cure, and their flirting had an uncomfortable Eric give them the business card to find Infinite Solutions in order to leave.\nLearning online that Infinite Solutions holds and transfers super-criminals to trial or prison, May talks their way in the front door but they leave soon after as their cover story can take them no further. With the front door no longer a viable option, Otto takes May upwards to a top floor server room, they look for data onX-RayandVaporin order to make the necessary cure. Detecting them in separate detention cells, they find X-Ray in an open holding area before a guard finds them and gets a shot off as Otto attacks warning other guards. As Otto races to fight the guards approaching, he gives May the keycard of the guard he just struck and the Omni-Scanner so she could gain the sample from Vapor.\nSeeing a chance to fight, X-Ray tricks a guard to deactivate the power dampeners before killing him. Disappointed in X-Ray's lackluster performance, Otto easily overwhelms him and demands to know his connection to their current location. X-Ray explains the U-Foes's failed fight withHulk[1], then imprisonment, followed by their escape and getting a job which led to their encounter with the two Spider-Men[2], before their recent incarceration. But X-Ray's mentioning of theother Spider-Manas \"superior\" offends Otto, but he grows intrigued by the more advanced Spider-Man mentioned. Taking the sample from X-Ray, more guards arrive ordering Otto to surrender, but seeks to \"correct\" their misunderstanding of his standing among villains.\nOnce May arrives at Vapor's cell, the super criminal asks to be called Ann and the two connect over their snarky sarcasm. With introductions done, May explains Peter's importance to her as well as his injury caused by the U-Foes attack on ESU. Despite Ann's self view that she's a bad guy, May simply views her as someone who's made mistakes in life, and that one of her mistakes led to Peter's hospitalization. As the doctor's can't help, Ann questions how she possibly could as May opens the door to her cell. Answering that a simple of her biology is needed for a cure, Ann happily complies with painlessly giving the sample and the two part amicably.\nWith Otto having taken down many security guards, he demands to know who is at the pinnacle of authority behind Infinite Solutions,  finding an endless loop of shell companies tracing. But as he threatens a still conscious agent, May walks in on him and demands he stop. Apologizing and explaining his uncovering a conspiracy, she doesn't want to hear it and returns his equipment no longer wanting any part in his activities. But as Otto tries to elaborate his need to use his power in a \"the means justify the ends\" ideal, May believes he has used his powers irresponsibly and tearfully takes her leave. Sometime later, May gets a phone call fromDr. Burdickthat an anonymous delivery gave his team the research needed to treat Peter. Heading over toMcCarthy Medicalwhile angry Otto still did the right thing, May thanks Burdick's team upon arrival before finding Peter awake from his coma, quipping again before the two hug.\nElsewhere at night, Doctor Octopus attacks a satellite location for Infinite Solutions, which he swiftly deduced to be a shell company for theBeyond Corporation. Taking a keycard off a guard, Doctor Octopus gains access to the core servers and is offended to find that Beyond took assets from the defunctParker Industries, turning their Spider-Man into an inferior copy based off his work. Not abiding their 'plagiarism' of his Spider-Man technology, Doctor Octopus swears to show Beyond that he stands superior to them, and aims to bring them down.\n• With her nephew at death's door, May Parker is not just going to sit around accepting that Peter's ailments aren't solvable with conventional means.\n• Aunt May is going to seek UNCONVENTIONAL MEANS by way of her ex-fiancé DOCTOR OCTOPUS!!!"

Telling him not to be so melodramatic, Dr. Harwood says the contract is only binding for ten years, with options; explaining that he will serve as a security officer at the Life Foundation's underground commune. As Eddie complains about playing babysitter to conspiricy theorist millionaires, Dr. Harwood tells him to stop whining and manifesthis symbiotebefore injecting them with her cure. As she tells Eddie he has one week to wrap up any unfinished business, Venom asks how he'll know she's kept her end of the deal. Remarking that she anticipated he'd ask that, she shows Venom to a testing chamber, commenting that she'd wanted to hire the sonic supervillainUlysses Klaw, but that since he was imprisoned in the super villain prison known as theVault, they had to build an artificial version - a colossal android called theMechaniklaw. As Venom leaps out of the way of the Mechaniklaw's sonic arm-cannon, Dr. Harwood snaps at him to hold still. Venom fires back that she's obviously never felt the agony sonic attacks inflict on his symbiote, and that reflexes are hard to ignore. Belittling Eddie's intelligence, Dr. Harwood tells him to man up and hold still; Venom retorting that if he feels so much as a twinge of discomfort he'll inflict such suffering upon her that even gods would flee in terror. As the Mechaniklaw blasts Venom with its arm-cannon, trapping him in a sonic cage, Dr. Harwood calls the incredulous Venom a moron and mockingly asks if he expects all his opponents to explain precisely how their powers work before trying to kill him. Begrudgingly admitting she's right, Venom braces himself and passes through the bars of the sonic cage, shocked and overjoyed to feel nothing. Approaching, Dr. Harwood smugly asks if he's satisfied now. Saying that he's not, Venom launchs himself feet-first into the Mechaniklaw, smashing it into a wall and crushing its chest, before saying thatnowhe's satisfied. Horrified, Dr. Harwood protests that the Mechaniklaw cost a massive amount of money to build before grumbling that the budget department will be furious.\nTaking a cab to Manhattan, Eddie Brock decides to check outAllen Hoffman's place of work, the symbiote wordlessly admonishing him for wasting time when they could be killing Spider-Man. Telling it to be patient, Eddie spots Hoffman leaving the building and decides to follow him, telling himself that he's not doing it to be a creepy stalker but to make absolutely sure that Hoffman's able to makeAnne Weyinghappy. As Hoffman ducks into an alleyway, Eddie becomes suspicious and spots him giving patient files to a drug dealer in exchange for money. As the drug dealer leaves, Eddie seethes with rage and transforms into Venom, lunging at Hoffman and cocooning his head in webbing to stop him from screaming. Venom considers killing Hoffman then and there, but notes that doing so would leave Anne with a broken heart and instead tells Hoffman to leave New York and never return, on pain of an agonizing and bloody death. Tossing Hoffman to the ground, Venom tells him to go.\nAt a warehouse across town, Timothy Karlskin laments the deaths ofJagged BowandBlood Spider, perusing the dark web for super villain job offers. Coming across one that looks promising, he applies.\nWalking down the street, Eddie tells the symbiote that since they don't have a Spider-Sense they'll need to be vigilant. Sneering that Peter Parker is a glory-hound, Eddie abruptly spots Spider-Man web-swinging towards a burning high-rise and takes off in pursuit, snarling that Parker probably started the fire himself and that they need to kill him before he endangers any more innocents. As Eddie starts to transform into Venom, he runs past a burger joint owned byObnoxioand it abruptly transforms into the grotesque clown's likeness as some police cars drive past with their sirens blaring. Incredulous, Eddie realizes Dr. Harwood's formula destabilized the symbiote's shapeshifting powers just as a fire truck drives past, causing the symbiote to spontaneously transform into the likeness of the main character of a pirate movie playing at a nearby cinema. Hearing the commotion of people laughing at Eddie, Spider-Man notes that since it didn't trigger his Spider-Sense it must not be dangerous and keeps going.\nReturning to the Kelner Scientific Innovations lab, Eddie furiously demands that Dr. Harwood cleanse the symbiote of her formula. Pouring herself a cup of coffee, Dr. Harwood retorts that she warned him that the formula is experimental and could have unexpected side-effects, Eddie again demanding she cure the symbiote. As she protests that she just needs to make a few minor tweaks to perfect it, Eddie threatens to suffocate her with the symbiote's tendrils. Begrudgingly agreeing, Dr. Harwood gives him an injection and submits him to a gamut of tests to prove the symbiote has been cleansed of her formula - restoring its weakness to sound in the process. Checking her smartphone, Dr. Harwood disdainfully remarks that he's still obligated to work for the Life Foundation, but Venom looms over her and snarls that he remembers every single condescending remark she made towards him. A trio of hardened security guards respond to Dr. Harwood's screams and are so traumatized by what they find that one immediately throws up, one quits the next morning, and the other is rendered mute for the rest of his life.\nLater that evening, Venom perches atop the Brooklyn Bridge and looks out over the East River, Eddie asking the symbiote why it looks so monstrous when bonded to him given that while it was bonded to Spider-Man it looked like a regular costume, lamenting that there's so much he doesn't know about it. His navel-gazing is interrupted by the super villain mercenaryChance, who knocks him off his perch. Securing himself with a web-line, Venom furiously wonders why he keeps getting attacked for no reason. Camouflaging himself against the bridge's support pillar, Venom snarls that he'll make sure this latest annoyance never bothers him again. Circling the bridge, Chance wonders if he hit Venom hard enough to knock him into the water, noting his helmet's HUD isn't showing anything. Venom grabs his ankle and slams him into the pillar, Chance activating his rocket boosters to break free and switching his HUD to thermal display. Blasted into the hood of a car, Venom snarls that he'll repaint Chance's costume red with blood. Introducing himself as an adrenaline junkie who uses high-risk mercenary work to stave off boredom and sate his gambling addiction, Chance says his mission is Venom's death. Ripping the black off a flatbed truck, Venom shields himself from Chance's lasers. Noting he can't melt through the metal fast enough, Chance opens fire with acid rockets and is shocked that the symbiote is barely fazed. As Venom declares his intent to eat Chance's face, the mercenary realizes he's outmatched and flees, saying no bounty is worth risking his life. Venom is left incredulous, wondering who would take out a bounty on him and why.\nDAVID MICHELINIE AND IVAN FIORELLI'S TOUR DE FORCE THROUGH YESTERYEAR CONTINUES!"

TheEternalshave opened their transport nodes all overEarthto use their cities as shelter.Tommakes his family stay at home, distrusting the strange portal that had opened outside, but his house begins to collapse.Katrinasees a portal, but instead repeatedly ventures into a burning building, rescuing people until she doesn't make it out alive.Komalifinds comfort in thinking ofArjunas her building collapses.Danielahelps her mother into a portal, a small part of her lamenting that she left her bike behind. Jada gazes at the Eternal city, wishing she could share it with her daughter or anyone. Her thoughts are interrupted by the cries ofKenta, who is without his parents. Jada approaches the boy to comfort him. TheProgenitorkeeps trying to order the world to end, but it fights back.\nStarfoxwalks past a crowd of cheering citizens to convene withNightcrawler. He informs that the heroes' forces have managed to tamper with theMachine That is Earthenough to prevent the Progenitor from activating its self-destruct. Kurt hopes this can give the heroes infiltrating the Progenitor more time, but Captain America warns him that the Celestial will change tactics. The Progenitor creates a rift on the planet in order to directly access the Machine's reality loom. Inside the Progenitor,Iron Man's strike team keeps pushing against the Celestial's defenses.Mister Sinisterpouts at the fact that the Progenitor hasn't judged him yet.Makkari,AjakandSersihave realized that the Celestial has temporarily deactivated their protocols, giving them free will at last. The heroes breach into the Progenitor's core, finding a smaller manifestation of its self inside. Orbs float around it, showcasing what the Progenitor is observing, but it appears unresponsive to the intruders.Jean Greytakes the opportunity to strike, but Ajak strikes her down.\nThe Progenitor reaches the Eternals' city. Starfox hasDomoteleport weapons to the refugees so they can fight back against the Celestial, but it does little. Nightcrawler and Captain America teleport in front of the Progenitor, distracting it long enough for a half-rebirthSyneto get the jump on it. She has joined forces withExodus, who is channeling all the power of a circuit of mutants through Syne to empower her. Inside the Progenitor, Ajak confronts Jean Grey. She and Iron Man agree that if they end this now, the billions of humans killed by the Progenitor will remain dead. Jean ponders that it might be a lost cause, but Tony argues that they have to at least try. Ajax suggests the other option is convincing the Progenitor that its judgment is flawed, and that this is a test on itself. The Progenitor is amused, and keeps gathering more information with the few seconds left the Earth has. Syne burns out by Exodus' empowerment, and the Celestial returns to its task. However,Moira MacTaggertleads the forces ofOrchisagainst it. Disgusted by their intervention, Jean has Mister Sinister knock down Ajak, and she prepares to strike at the Progenitor's manifestation again. The Progenitor suddenly moves, gesturing a force field around Jean. It confirms that this was a test, and tells Jean that she failed. The Celestial explains that it was questioning itself, but has concluded that the Earth does deserve to die, since its inhabitants remain guided by self-interest. In order to show the Progenitor that the Eternals can change, Sersi has the Machine broadcast her words to disclose the truth behind the Eternals' rebirth, that each resurrection costs a human's life, and that she has ensured to keep it a secret. She invites humanity to judge the Eternals. The humans revolt. Sersi refutes the Progenitor, but it explodes Sersi into purple mist with a wave of its arm before she can finish speaking.\nGrief-stricken, Ajak questions whether the Progenitor deserves to destroy the Earth, claiming that this is a test for the Celestial as well, and that it will fail if it does so. Jean Grey recalls that the Progenitor failed her due to theDark Phoenix's destruction, but points out that she was out of control, whereas the Progenitor is doing this consciously. She caresses it, asking whether it can live with it. The Progenitor tells her that it doesn't matter if it stops, since less than a billion people still live. Stark refutes it, remarking that the Progenitor is himself in a twisted way, and that when he gets out of his depth, he tries to make amends. The Progenitor warns that doing so could destroy it, and Tony tells it that's what being a hero is about. In its outer form, the Progenitor strikes the ground with its staff, generating a massive beam of light. In his inner monologue, the Celestial doubts its godhood, but assures that it can put things back in place. It concludes that it is not a god, since it would be without limits if it were truly omnipotent. Inside the Progenitor, its manifested form loses its balance. It asks Ajak for her judgment, and she remorsefully fails it. Crying, the Progenitor tells her that she is correct, and touches her hand, asking her to be better. The flash of light dissipates, and Iron Man and his allies find themselves outside the Progenitor, who has become once again the inertAvengers Mountain. Tony's systems detect that, althoughUranos' damage and the Eternal War scars remain, the decimation caused by the Progenitor has been reverted. AsMakkariand Jean wonder where Sersi and Ajak are, the latter descends, imbued with the Progenitor's Celestial power. She explains that Sersi remains dead since it was humanity's judgment. Proclaiming that she is now Ajak Celestia, the Eternals' new god, she tells Makkari that she will strive to be worthy of them if they strive to be worthy of her.\nAlthough dead, the Progenitor narrates. Tom and his family are alive, and he tries to process whatever secret his son disclosed when the world was ending. Katrina is venerated by her neighborhood, and she is letting it go to her head. A vision of Syne appears to Komali, and apologizes for taking Arjun's life when she resurrected; Komali laughs at the absurdity and then cries. Daniela continues working, but replies to a message from her mom faster than she would have before. Jada decides to sleep in until she gets a message on her phone that surprises her. Kenta tells his parents about his visit to the Eternal city and the people he met; his parents don't tell him that they had died, but find comfort that somebody looked after their child.\nAfter regaining the title of Prime Eternal from Starfox,Zurasreluctantly apologizes publicly toStorm, Nightcralwer forDruig's war onArakko. As a treaty of alliance, he offers Storm the ability to employ Uranos for an hour. When Storm asks about Druig, it is revealed that he has been made Uranos' cellmate as punishment. Zuras also explains that the Eternals won't go to war against the mutants again, since he doesn't personally interpret the mutants' deviation to be excessive enough. After Zuras teleports away, Starfox prepares to leave the building, but he is driven back by an anti-Eternal mob. Jean Grey has set up thePhoenix Foundationto shareKrakoa's gift of resurrection to the rest of the world, prioritizing the poor and disenfranchised. From theTreehouse,Cyclopscontemplates a family of bystanders sporting Orchis merchandise. TheAvengershang out in the Avengers Mountain; Iron Man and Captain America walk down a corridor, and Tony jokingly brags about the Progenitor passing him and not Steve, but Cap shoots him down, pointing out that the Celestial was based on Stark and also tried to kill the Earth. Tony invites Steve to the pool in memory of Sersi, but Steve declines to meet up with Jada. He gifts her back a cup of coffee, and they contemplate the still-damaged city. Jada tells Steve that this doesn't prove anything, and Rogers admits that Jada was right, and ponders that maybe the Progenitor was right as well, since it's not a good world, but one never knows.\nIn its narration, the Progenitor remarks that the Earth didn't pass as much as it failed. In an underground temple, Ajak Celestia reveres a statue of Sersi. The late Celestial explains that it was not worthy of judging anyone, and Ajak will work to become a worthy god. It expresses that Ajak will not make its mistake, that a species can't be judged in a single day, and that judgment is ongoing. Ajak walks past Makkari and steps out of the cave. The Progenitor states that every day could be the day the species goes too far, so one should act accordingly. Ajak stretches her fist forward with her thumb placed horizontally. The Progenitor declares that every day is Judgment Day."

Tossing Blood Spider and Jagged Bow aside withhis symbiote's tendrils, Venom mocks them for being careless while hunting him -- thereby letting him lure them into a trap -- and towers over Death-Shield, demanding to know why they're after him. Noticing Jagged Bow nocking an arrow from the corner of his symbiote's eyespot, Venom dodges and then tosses a car at him with a tendril, crushing him between two vehicles. Blood Spider and Death-Shield flee, and Venom contemplates devouring Jagged Bow's corpse before deciding against it, remarking that eating carrion would be undignified. Hiding nearby, a garage attendant films the fight and sends it to the local news station hoping to get a massive payout.\nLater,Professor Buck Mittysits in his cramped office inEmpire State University-- little more than a storage closet -- and laments to the insects surrounding him that his grant was rescinded, stymying his research into the potential for insects to change the world. Watching the broadcast of Venom's fight with the three mercenaries, Mitty is inspired to form a team of his own and test out his latest invention: theTrans-Species Liguitron, a machine that would allow him to communicate with other species. Noting that being part of a team would solve his money problems, Mitty opens a locker to revealhis old costumeand declares that the time has come for Humbug to soar again.\nThat afternoon, Eddie Brock sits in a tree inCentral Parkand assures the Venom symbiote that he's fine, grousing that the three mercenaries attacked them out of nowhere. Eddie laments that no-one questioned the ethics of ripping the symbiote fromits homeworldand bringing it to Earth, cared about the anguish the symbiote felt whenSpider-Mancruelly rejected and tried to kill it, or bothered to give him a second chance when his articles about theSin-Eaterwas revealed to be based ona charlatan's lies; though he admits that in retrospect neither he or the symbiote questioned the their decision to form a bond based on shared anger and become what many have called a monster. Eddie laments that he and the symbiote have become a target for heroes and villains alike simply because the world doesn't understand that all they want to do is protect the innocent -- and kill Spider-Man, of course -- and notes that sometimes he envies the uncomplicated lives of New York's ordinary civilians. As he starts to say he sometimes wishes he'd never become Venom, he hears a scream for help and sees a mohawk-sporting punk in a leather jacket attempting to steal on old woman's purse. Eddie transforms into Venom and lands behind the punk, mocking his fashion sense before taking the purse, webbing him to a tree, and attempting to return the old woman's purse. As the woman runs away screaming for the police, Venom laments that a \"thank-you\" would have been nice and leaves the purse on the park bench, web-swinging away as a crowd films the altercation.\nAt an abandoned warehouse on the edge of the Hudson River, Blood Spider and Death-Shield nurse their wounds and job-hunt through the newspaper. Humbug approaches and introduces himself, Death-Shield quipping to Blood Spider that Humbug's choice of name is even worse thanTaskmaster's. Posing dramatically, Humbug brags about his less-than-imposing powers and declares he's come to join their team before asking if they have dental coverage, Blood Spider and Death-Shield staring at him for a moment before laughing hysterically. Still laughing, Death-Shield tells Humbug to beat it and he leaves declaring they haven't seen the last of him.\nThat night, Eddie sits on theStatue of Liberty's torch and notes that as much as people like to give New York City a bad rap, everyone wants to live there. Looking out over the cityscape, Eddie remarks that he used to belong there, hada decent job,a loving wife, and even a dog... but now he's relegated to skulking through subways and sewers, living in abandoned buildings, and the salt-in-the-wound of knowing that his nemesis Spider-Man is free to enjoy all the things stolen from him. Eddie asks the symbiote why it's suddenly so silent before realizing that it's annoyed by him saying \"me\" instead of \"we\", and says that it's not his fault he had another life before their bonding. Noting that the same must have been true for the symbiote, Eddie asks what life on its homeworld was like and if it had a mate or pets, but the symbiote refuses to answer. Deciding to find someone else to talk to, Eddie shoots a webline at a passing helicopter and hitches a ride back to the mainland.\nAt her apartment, Anne Weying sings to herself while applying makeup only to be startled when Eddie abruptly walks in and admonishes her for not locking the door. Anne tells Eddie that the police are looking for him and he shouldn't be there, but Eddie says that by her side is exactly where he belongs and where he'd still be if he hadn't gone off the deep end and made her life as miserable as his own. As Eddie notes they had some good times, Anne agrees but says they can't go back to the way things were now that he's a wanted criminal. Anne is interrupted by a man's voice callign out to say their cab has arrived, and Anne turns to see Eddie has vanished. The speaker, Allen, enters the room and says he grabbed an umbrella so her hair wouldn't get wet, revealing himself to be Anne's new fiancé. Watching from outside, Eddie seethes with jealous rage and transforms into Venom, roaring that they'll tear Allen apart and eat him piece by piece... before stopping and admitting that he won't since doing so would hurt Anne even more than he already has.\nThe next morning at theKelner Scientific Innovations' Long Island branch, Dr. Harwood videoconferencesLife FoundationCEOCarlton Drakeand informs him that her new metagenic formula is undergoing the final round of animal testing as they speak. Smiling sinisterly, Drake warns her not to disappoint him lest she wind up a test subject herself, leaving her terrified.\nIn an abandoned subway tunnel, Eddie Brock benchpresses a massive set of weights but snaps the metal bar before he can reach five-hundred, lamenting that working out doesn't assuage his anger like it used to. The symbiote suggests they pick a fight with Spider-Man, and Eddie enthusiastically agrees and says they can go for ice-cream after. While prowling throughChinatown, Eddie brusquely sneers at an elderly homeless veteran who begs him for some change and is admonished by the symbiote, noting the old man is likely as much a victim of society as he is. Robbing a nearby jewelry store, Eddie dumps the pilfered necklaces and jewels into the old man's lap and apologizes for his earlier rudeness, walking away and applauding his generosity while failing to notice the old man being arrested by a pair of policemen.\nTaking a shortcut down an alley, Eddie reminisces about his days as an investigative reporter before coming out onto the main-street just in time to see a parade passing by. Expositing to the symbiote about the procession and displaying knowledge of Chinese folklore, Eddie spots someone suspicious in the crowd and narrowly evades Humbug blasting him with a sonic beam. As the symbiote engulfs him, Eddie confronts Humbug, who says he's impressed that Venom was able to avoid his attack. Expressing disdain at Humbug's codename, Venom demands to know how Humbug found him, the would-be vigilante proudly declaring he can talk to insects. Saying that that's weird, Venom plucks a cockroach off his shoulder and eats it; Humbug letting out a scream of anguish and blasting him with a full-force sonic beam. Dazed, Venom attempts to web Humbug up, but he counters with another sonic blast that disperses the symbiote from Eddie's hands. Leaping onto the roof of a building to recover, Venom launches himself at Humbug with his fangs and claws bared... only to be blasted point-blank by another sonic wave that rips the symbiote from his body. Realizing he can no-longer hear the symbiote's voice in his head, Eddie gathers it off the ground and escapes while Humbug is distracted by the arrival of the police. Cradling the seemingly deceased symbiote, Eddie begs for it to not be dead, lamenting that without it he's nothing.\nAt their warehouse hideout, Blood Spider and Death-Shield are flabbergasted to learn that Humbug managed to defeat Venom and contemplate accepting him into their group while plotting to find an excuse to withhold his cut of the take.\nAt Kelner Scientific Innovations' facility, Dr. Harwood informs Carlton Drake that her formula met the expected parameters in every test, Drake admonishing her not to get ahead of herself since there's no way to pretest whether it will work as planned on its intended target. Dr. Harwood states she'd bet her life on it that it will work as-planned, and when Drake reminds her that she already did she nervously assures him that within 48 hours Venom will be his to command."

Lamenting the apparent loss of his beloved Other, Eddie makes his way over to a furnace, cutting his feet on the broken glass. Complaining about the cold, he opens the vent door to let more heat out and a spark lands on the symbiote, resuscitating it. Eddie is overjoyed, noting thatHumbug's sonic blast must've knocked the symbiote unconscious until the spark acted as a defibrillator. Cradling the symbiote to his chest, Eddie tells it to rest and recover, since tomorrow they'll have their revenge.\nThe next morning, Humbug notes to a cockroach that the police have cordoned off his apartment building, preventing him from feeding the insects he keeps there or collecting his unemployment check. As he glumly wonders what he's going to do now,Blood SpiderandDeath-Shieldappear and say they have a few suggestions.\nWalking down the street, Eddie plans to get breakfast and passes a large puddle, wondering if it rained the night before. The symbiote alerts him to danger, and as it engulfs him Eddie turns to see the puddle is actuallyHydro-Man. Stating that it's about time Venom showed himself, Morris Bench says he's been waiting for three days for Venom to show himself and now intends to claim his reward. Snarling that he's not a prize to be won, Venom lunges at Hydro-Man only to pass right through him. Mocking Venom, Hydro-Man solidifies his fists and punches him from behind, knocking him to the ground. Incredulous, Venom wonders what happened to his fierce strength and power, before noticing a nearby delivery truck loaded with industrial laundry supplies. Noting strategy is a form of power, Venom goads Hydro-Man into attacking and dodges so that he hits the truck instead. Mixing with the spilled soap, Hydro-Man is mortified to find himself suddenly comprised of pink suds. Borrowing a nail gun from a nearby hardware store, Venom gleefully starts popping bubbles until Hydro-Man begs him to stop and flees into the sewers complaining about how embarrassing this is. Venom notes that betweenTaskmaster's protégées and Hydro-Man it seems he's the target of a bounty before wondering why.\nElsewhere, Humbug demands to know if Blood Spider and Death-Shield have come to mock him again. Death-Shield says they were wrong about him, Blood Spider making a morbid joke about their partnerJagged Bow's death. Death-Shield says they were impressed by how easily Humbug took down Venom, Blood Spider offering to make him the new leader of their team. Humbug immediately accepts, but when Blood Spider and Death-Shield say they want him to take down Venom again as payback for Jagged Bow he notes that his Trans-Species Liguitron is still in his apartment. Blood Spider and Death-Shield assure him that he won't need it, as Venom will find him the same way they did -- the phone book. As Humbug happily notes he's finally getting the recognition he deserves, Blood Spider whispers that while Venom's distracted mauling him they'll burn him to a crisp with their flamethrower.\nArriving at theDaily Globebuilding, his former workplace, Eddie decides to put his skills as an investigative journalist to good use. Disguising himself as a security guard, he sneaks past the front desk and breaks into one of the offices. Noting they haven't changed the passwords since he was last there, he researches Humbug for a way to counter his sonic attacks. Hoping against hope, Eddie searches forAnne Weying's name and is dismayed to find a recent newspaper announcing her pending marriage toAllen James Hoffman, a wealthy psychiatrist with a Park Avenue office. His jealous grumbling is interrupted by one of his old coworkers, Dallas, recognizing him. Eddie tries to play it cool, recalling they'd worked together covering a scandal involvingRoxxonand suggesting they chat about the good old days over some coffee, but Dallas panics -- saying that he knows Eddie has turned into a monster. Transforming, Venom calls Dallas a traitor and backs him towards a window, Dallas cringing in terror... only to see Venom has vanished.\nWeb-swinging away as Venom, Eddie contemplates the symbiote's mental voice bemoaning not gutting Dallas and eating his brains but says that mirroring his betrayal would've made them no better than him and that they can always eat him later. Noting that theDaily Globe's records provided them with Humbug's address, Venom spots Humbug himself standing on a nearby rooftop, seemingly alone. As Venom drops down behind him, Humbug says he's been waiting and unleashes a sonic blast. Quipping that he's learned from their last fight, Venom dodges and webs Humbug's sonic emitters, snarling that he's deduced Humbug will be helpless without them. Freeing his hands with a sonic blast, Humbug shouts that he's never helpless. As Blood Spider and Death-Shield hide nearby, Venom snarls that Humbug's amplified insect sounds present a unique problem, but he's researched Humbug's weaknesses as well and it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand; snaring a rooftop air conditioner and throwing it at Humbug. The symbiote notices Blood Spider attempting to sneak up behind Venom and alerts Eddie to the new threat, Venom clogging the flamethrower's nozzle with webbing and causing it to explode. Horrified by his other longtime partner's death, Death-Shield flees.\nVenom demands to know why Humbug was looking for him, but Humbug snaps that all he was looking for was a job - something that Venom ruined. Blasted into a wall, Venom rips open a junction box and grabs the wires, Humbug aghast at him risking electrocuting himself. Venom comments that his symbiote can handle the voltage, and even better channel and reduce it. Coiling an electrified tentacle around Humbug, Venom shorts out his equipment. Humbug surrenders and tells Venom to get it over with and kill him. Surprised, Venom asks if Humbug really wants to die, and Humbug says that all he wanted was to show the world how insects could benefit humanity, only to be laughed at and have his grant money taken byEmpire State University. Noting that Humbug was an innocent wronged by evil men who took everything he cares about, Venom says he understands what that's like and leaves Humbug kneeling on the rooftop.\nExiting the apartment, Eddie notes that they should leave before the police arrive only to be identified and approached by Dr.Dana Harwood, who says she has a proposition for Eddie and his symbiote. Suspicious, Eddie asks how she found them and Dr. Harwood saysthe organizationshe works for enabled her to access almost every security camera in the city -- including the one on the roof of the apartment. Angry at being spied on, Eddie prepares to transform into Venom but stops when Dr. Harwood says she can make his symbiote immune to sonic attacks.\nVENOM VS HYDRO-MAN…FOR THE FIRST TIME!"

He and his platoon had been pinned down by Việt Cộng soldiers, locked in combat for hours; until the shooting was suddenly replaced by screaming. Two hours prior, the surviving members of the soldier's platoon went ahead to see what happened, and since then there's only been an unnatural silence. Mustering the courage to investigate, the soldier sees a humanoidcreature made of living darknessmessily devouring the corpse of a soldier, while the mutilated bodies of his platoon members and Việt Cộng lie scattered and half-eaten. The soldier's horrified gasp alerts the monster to his presence, but as the soldier takes aim at it a second monster wearing a bandoleer and American military apparel suddenly grabs him from behind and lifts him by the throat. Forcing the soldier to stare into its spiral-shaped crimson eyespot, the monster speaks in an eldritch language before its jaws gape; the soldier's scream cut off as it devours him.\nSpeaking toLogan,S.H.I.E.L.D.directorNick Furytells him that weeks earlier anomalous seismological activity had been recorded in Scandinavia. Suspecting Hydra was trying to tunnel through the Earth's mantle again, S.H.I.E.L.D. had instead discoveredan enormous jet-black dragon-like monsterfrozen inside a glacier. Excavating the monster and running tests, S.H.I.E.L.D. determined it was extraterrestrial and still alive. Obtaining samples of its biomass, they determined that it was symbiotic and suitable hosts were transformed into predatory monsters. Logan mockingly asks how long it took to move on to human testing, but Fury remarks that he and S.H.I.E.L.D. are beholden to the American government, who wanted to replace the MIACaptain AmericaASAP. He admits he personally selected the recruits for theSym-Soldier Program, a black-ops team of symbiote-augmented supersoldiers led byRex Strickland- codenamedTyrannosaurus. The Sym-Soldiers had been deployed to take out a Việt Cộng weapons depot, and had wiped it and a company of soldiers off the face of the Earth. Logan remarks that sounds like a good thing, but Fury retorts that the company of soldiers were American. Logan asks what that's got to do with him, Fury attempting to appeal to his sense of patriotism only to be reminded that Logan is Canadian. Fury launches into a spiel that Logan interrupts; stating Fury needs the monsters he created put down, pure and simple. Logan exasperatedly calls Fury out on sending the first discovered alien organisms to war, though Fury is unmoved and says a chopper will be waiting to pick them up in the morning. Logan protests, saying he doesn't work well with teams; and Fury retorts that no-one would be stupid enough to put Logan ona team-- they're doing this themselves.\nThe military helicopter drops Logan and Fury off in Vietnam, but as they trek through the jungle Logan remarks that even he can't find five killers in a country saturated by blood and death. Fury remarks that tracking the Sym-Soldiers would be impossible regardless, as they can camouflage their appearances and even their scent; informing Logan that he implanted explosive kill-switches equipped with tracking devices in them - not that it matters since the Sym-Soldiers left a trail of mostly-devoured corpses. Logan remarks that he can't even tell what side they were on, Fury asking if it even matters at this point. Logan asks why Fury doesn't just detonate the kill-switches, and Fury responds that it symbiotes' hosts die they will seek out new ones; Logan noting that it would be disastrous if the Communists acquired one. Logan finds one of the kill switches on the ground, realizing the Sym-Soldiers clawed them out. Logan notes that something's close as Rex Strickland emerges from the jungle. Fury demands to know what he's doing, and Rex states his symbiote abandoned him. Staring at his hands, Rex tells Fury that he and his men lost control of their symbiotes, which started screaming in an alien language and causing them to black out, waking up surrounded by half-eaten corpses. As Rex spots the bodies and is horrified by what he and his comrades had done, Fury demands to know what's causing the Sym-Soldiers to go AWOL.\nThe real Rex Strickland bursts from the jungle holding a flamethrower and shouting at Fury to get away. The Tyrannosaurus symbiote - its ruse exposed - discards its humanoid form and attacks Fury. Logan opens fire despite Rex telling him bullets are useless, the symbiote using a tendril to puncture his flamethrower's fuel tank. Logan tackles Rex and cuts the tank off just as it explodes, burning the side of Rex's face. Rex thanks Logan for saving him, but is shocked and repulsed to see Logan's burns regenerating. Noticing the symbiote is gone, Fury demands to know where it went; Rex stating they need to run before the others arrive. In response to Logan saying they'll stop the Sym-Soldiers and save his comrades, Rex states that the symbiotes are all-but invulnerable and there's nothing he, Logan, and Fury can do to fight them. The Tyrannosaurus symbiote returns accompanied by the other Sym-Soldiers, Logan telling Rex to save himself. Rex flees despite Fury ordering him to stand and fight; Logan being pinned down by the Sym-Soldiers and taken over by the Tyrannosaurus symbiote. Rex stops, seeing Fury cornered as Tyrannosaurus-Logan speaks in the symbiotes' eldritch language and leaps towards him. Rex dives in between them and blasts Tyrannosaurus-Logan with Fury's energy gun, searing the symbiote off him. Logan takes the gun and aims it at Fury, who has been dogpiled by the Sym-Soldiers. Rex protests that Logan will kill Fury too, but Logan retorts he's planning on it. The ensuing blast drives off the Sym-Soldiers, Logan explaining that Fury was actually aLife-Model Decoybeing remotely piloted by the real Nick Fury, calling him out on not being man enough to face his own mistakes in person. Logan berates Fury, saying that having been bonded to one of the symbiotes he knows what S.H.I.E.L.D. has been doing. Fury remarks that he had no way of knowing what it was they had found or how dangerous it was, and that when they found out the symbiote-dragon was still alive they began searching for a way to kill it. Fury tries to justify his actions, saying they had to know how to kill them if they became a liability, and had no way of knowing they share a hive-mind and could feel the pain and rage of the original. In response to Logan's outburst about treating him and the symbiotes like animals, Fury says he needed this cleaned up quickly and quietly, with no witnesses, saying he's sorry it had to end like this as the LMD begins counting down. When Logan informs him that the LMD is about to self-destruct, Rex protests that they have to run but Logan says that they can't escape the blast radius and that Rex would only die tired. As the Sym-Soldiers return and attack, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote rebonds to Rex; conveying fear and regret for its actions and rage towards S.H.I.E.L.D. Grabbing Logan, Tyrannosaurus snarls that they are not animals and tosses him clear of the blast. The explosion blasts the Tyrannosaurus symbiote off Rex, killing him and incapacitating the other Sym-Soldiers.\nThe Tyrannosaurus symbiote disguises itself as Rex and is recovered by S.H.I.E.L.D., being debriefed by Fury himself and told not to breathe a word of what happened. When \"Rex\" asks what happened to the man named Logan, Fury sternly states there was no such person; asking \"Rex\" if he understands that he did what it felt he had to and stating he would make the same call again as many times as necessary to make the world a better place. Smiling grimly, \"Rex\" replies that he understands and is just happy to be alive. Fury remarks that Rex's bloodwork came back clean but that the other Sym-Soldiers weren't so lucky: their symbiotes have bonded to them such that removing them would kill the host, and therefore they've been cryogenically preserved. \"Rex\" asks if Fury recovered his symbiote, but Fury replies that they were unable to locate it, saying he has his best man for the job on it. When \"Rex\" asks who this is, Fury presents him with a S.H.I.E.L.D. badge and says that he is, provided he wants to help hunt an alien; and \"Rex\" replies that it would be an honor.\nSPINNING OUT OF THE PAGES OF VENOM!"

While Richard is unmatched in battle, his brother is a cowardly musician, ill-spoken of by others at court. During festivities to mark a battle well-fought, a beggar arrives at Camelot seeking an audience with Richard- sending the sign of a pentagram, Merlin arrives to relay the story of the forging of Excalibur- and her dark sister, Chaos the Doombringer, an ebony blade sought by Arthur’s nephew Sir Modred. In order to prevent Modred achieving the blade, Merlin instructs Richard to capture the blade alone and in secrecy, but is interrupted by the drunken Percy who determines to accompany his brother. Meanwhile, Modred’s lieutenant Kargal proposes they bide their time and ambush Merlin’s agents once the sword has been recovered.\nAmbushed by bandits, Richard defeats them with ease as Percy watches, then ventures into a cave where he is captured by a man-octopus. As Percy bursts into the cave and attacks the octopus, Richard bids him wait- the octopus is not attempting to hurt him, and is revealed to be guarding a witch’s cave. The witch directs Richard and Percy to the blade, but with dire warnings- their quest will end in death, and a loss greater than that which Richard can imagine. Their journey takes them through encounters with vampires, zombies, wolves and yeti, while Modred and Kargal watch Camelot and plan a contingency- if the blade cannot be won in combat, Kargal’s thrice-cursed amulet will release dark magic to capture the blade. Richard and Percy lose their horses in a swamp, but discover a clearing where a large beast guards the black sword, clasped in a dark gauntlet as a mirror of the lady presenting Excalibur. Richard is beaten by the beast, however Percy draws the blade against his brother’s protestations and runs the monster through. Claiming Chaos’ power for his own, Percy leads his brother back to Camelot, enraptured by the blade, and when Richard insists it be surrendered to Merlin, Percy refuses. Merlin muses that Percy may already be lost to them.\nOutside, Kargal and his men waylay Percy, mistaking him in his new warrior bearing for his brother, and he quickly takes the upper hand, christening himself the Black Knight. The noise of the attack draws Richard, who arrives as a crossbow bolt to the back slays his brother and Kargal recovers the ebony blade. Richard’s mere steel is no match for the star-forged weapon, but he hurls his broken sword at Kargal and pierces the villain’s throat. As Kargal dies, he unleashes the power of the amulet and a giant red demon appears to claim the sword. For his brother’s honour Richard refuses to relinquish the blade, and discovering that it cannot be used to defeat the demon, is defeated. However, Merlin calls to the gods who empower Avalon’s witches and uses their power to separate demon from sword, giving Richard the chance to snatch the blade and strike true to behead the demon. As the demonic magic is freed, Richard and Merlin agree this to be only the start of their problems.\nModred’s servants report their success in slaying Richard of Scandia, but begin a plan to use other means to win Arthur’s throne. As Merlin and Richard burn Percy’s body they discuss the risks of wielding the ebony blade, and Richard’s need to adopt a foppish routine as Sir Percy in order to honour his brother’s memory and keep Arthur safe; Sir Richard thusly swears to defend Camelot as the Black Knight."

Thered symbiote dragonattempts to ambush him from behind, but he strikes it in the jaw with Mjolnir. Regenerating, the red symbiote dragon takes off, but Thor leaps onto its back. Snaring him with tendrils and attempting to throttle him, the red symbiote dragon flies higher; but Thor conjures a hurricane and channels its lightning into Mjolnir. Breaking free, he brings the divine hammer down on the red symbiote dragon's head, electrocuting it with divine lightning and sending it plummeting into theNorth Seabelow. Sinking, the red symbiote dragon's body unravels and reaches tendrils out towards the surrounding sea-life.\nIn the present, the red symbiote dragon - now having assumed a feminine humanoid form and going by \"Big Mother\" - sneers that the pathetic parasites that writhe on the Earth's surface will never know the truth of what happened to her that day, just that theballadwritten to commemorate her defeat is a mess of lies compiled to inspire hope. Big Mother states that after her defeat she opted to recover from her injuries and bide her time untilKnull's arrival, feeding on the cold-blooded sea-life until the time came when she could feast on a warmer meal. AsAndi Bentondesperately swims to the surface, Big Mother swallows her whole.\nAddressing theScream symbiote, Big Mother sneers that it has no reason to resist her now that its host is gone. As she attempts to comfort it, saying that Andi wasn't worthy of its grandeur and that when Knull arrives its true potential will be unleashed; the Scream symbiote squirms free of her grip and plunges itself into one of Big Mother's nostrils. Oozing into her throat, it finds Andi's broken body. On the brink of death, Andi welcomes it as it rebonds to her, fully accepting their bond and acknowledging the symbiote as worthy of being her family.\nAs Scream gives her a serious case of indigestion, Big Mother demands that she stop. As Scream rips free, Andi paraphrasesMacbethand compares herself toMacduff, the Scream symbiote agreeing that they are reborn. Surging to the surface, the Scream symbiote separates from Andi and says that it needs to heal her. Collapsing, Andi thanks it for saving her, happy at having found her family. Before they can celebrate, Big Mother rises from the depths; the Scream symbiote quickly rebonding to Andi. Furious at having been rejected, Big Mother hurls Scream into the side of a bus and then rips the vehicle in half. As Scream flees up the side of an under-construction skyscraper in theFinancial District, Big Mother dismisses the Scream symbiote as pathetic and corrupted by the Light, snarling that Scream is dead to her and will never know her true potential now.\nAs Big Mother scales the side of the building, Scream pelts her with rebar, Big Mother mockingly asking if that was supposed to hurt and proclaiming that she was born of Knull's divine blood whereas Scream is descended from lowly parasites. As Big Mother prepares to eat her again, Scream shoots hair-tendrils down the symbiote-giantess' throat, through her sinuses and out through her eyes. Sneering that Big Mother's so-called royal blood has been diluted by the brine she spent centuries marinating in and that all she can do now is cry out to her Daddy, Scream grabs the cable of a nearby construction crane. Looping it around Big Mother's neck, Scream fashions it into a makeshift noose and snarls that Big Mother's bloodline ends with her and that she's burning down the family tree.\nAs Scream leaves Big Mother to hang, the Scream symbiote warns Andi that this won't kill her and that sooner or later she'll be back. Returning to human form, Andi mentally tells it she's exhausted, Scream offering to take over while it heals her. Andi thanks it, saying that for the longest time she was searching for a home when she should have seen she had one all along. Their mental dialogue is interrupted as Big Mother struggles to free herself, furiously chanting that God is coming until her head suddenly rips off. As the massive body plummets to the ground, Andi walks up to the severed head and tells it she's a terrible mother. In response, Big Mother speaks in the symbiote language, retorting that God is coming.\nThe following morning, Detectives Henley and Castro survey Big Mother's apparent corpse and discuss how the \"flaming Medusa\" seen fighting her matches the description of the symbiote-augment who attacked theF.E.A.S.T. Center; Henley noting he has a suspect in mind. Castro notes that her boyfriend finally left her due to her chronic nightmares, Henley remarking that he doesn't sleep anymore. A voice interrupts their discussion and they turn to see severalF.B.I.agents approaching, Agent MacNeill cutting off Detective Henley's protests by telling him that afterCarnage attacked Dovertonthe F.B.I. had establisheda task force to deal with symbiotes, making this scene their jurisdiction. As the Anti-Symbiote Task Force carts Big Mother's apparent corpse away, Detective Henley stews in frustration; Detective Castro remarking she was worried he was going to pick a fight with Agent MacNeill. Storming off, Detective Henley tells her to put out an APB for Andi Benton.\nAt the F.E.A.S.T. Center, Andi is shaken awake by May Parker, who tells her they need to talk. When Andi asks what May means, May tells Andi that she's aware the younger woman is hosting a symbiote, Andi dejectedly asking if that means May is kicking her out. Sitting next to Andi and taking her hand, May assures Andi that that's not the case, but just as the people who stay at the shelter trust her with their lives, she needs to be able to trust Andi to protect it. Andi promises to do her best, May pulling her into a hug and telling her that she'll always have a home and family.\nSPINNING OUT OF ABSOLUTE CARNAGE!\n• With Eddie Brock nowhere to be found, Andi Benton – the new SCREAM – will have to tangle with a monstrous creature at the bottom of the bay all on her own!"

The Mayor decides to go look for himself, for once just a spectator instead of the reason for Daredevil's misfortune.\nDaredevil, on the ground, is kept at gunpoint by Officer Cole North. He manages to subdue the detective, and starts running away, as his partner, Higgins, shoots at him. While Higgins calls for reinforcements, Daredevil hides in a fashion outlet, where he borrows some clothes to blend in the crowd. Nevertheless, North spots him and follows him to a road block made by police cars. Surrounded by the police and with Fisk grinning at him, Daredevil asks some officers how are their families, implying he saved some of their close ones. North is upset by this scene, ordering every officer to do their job and apprehend him. Daredevil throws North's gun at him, and the two engage in a fist fight in the ring of policemen watching. Devil loses because of the gun wound on his shoulder, and is arrested. North tries to unmask him before letting him inside the car, but an older officer stops him, asking him to wait until they are at the station in respect of Daredevil's services toNew York Citythroughout the years. North accepts with indifference, while Higgins notices that now he will be considered a hero, but only by the criminals of the city. Fisk and Welch leave, in order to prepare a speech on this event.\nJust as Daredevil, handcuffed in the back of a police car, thinks his career is over, a myriad of projectiles and smoke bombs drop on the scene, causing the police to retreat. North decides to break cover and confronts Daredevil, who managed to crawl outside the car in the mayhem: but as the vigilante tries to explain he has nothing to do with this, North is choked bysomeonefrom behind.\nRegaining his senses, Daredevil finds himself on an operating table, with his wound medicated. The man who \"saved\" him is none other thanThe Punisher, who believes Matt has finally \"seen the light.\""

Looking through his phone, he's happy to see a text byMary Janeencouraging him to get his physical therapy, but slightly bothered thatFelicialeft a seductive note written in lipstick about liking to watch him sleep on the ceiling; hoping he won't be billed for the ceiling writing. Finding that he did other stuff in his morphine hazed delirium the night before, Peter's Spider-Sense stings out of control, similarly to how it felt after theU-Foesbattle. Thinking on how Mary Jane asked he take time for himself and since Ben's death he never stood still, Peter fights through the agony of his Spider-Sense to tell it to get out. Finally down in his mindscape, his Spider-Sense manifests into abstract form and walks away.\nLater, Lois finds Peter sitting in a chair across from his bed, she delivers a package he ordered and he promises to do his therapy once he gets up on his feet. In his Spider-Man costume again, Peter stretches to get his body limber before jumping head first to stop a car-jacking. However, with his online ordered gear is all Halloween festive coupled his Spider-Sense being unresponsive, Peter takes a beating by two human carjackers. HearingNYPDradio report backup en route, Peter is relieved to see Captain America help, but hisshieldstrikes Peter in the face when stopping a bullet from hitting him, as Cap usually expects Spider-Man to dodge projectiles. With failing to stop a simple carjacking, Peter realizes he didn't recover enough and went out too early.\nDreaming of himself as a boy when he had a fever, Peter recallsAunt May's strictness after he stole a pack of bubblegum. She notes his fever is reduced and the medicine she gave him reduced hissenseof pain, telling him it is still there but unnoticed unless he wants to feel it. After she leaves, Peter realizes he's in a dream of a memory seeing his Spider-Sense in the for of his Spider-Man persona made entirely of webbing. Refusing to take it back in fear of the pain,Uncle Benenters the room to tell Peter that hiding won't work. Gifting Peter the bubblegum he stole, Ben gives Peter a talk about how being a good person doesn't bring a reward most of the time, it almost always costs something, handing Peter his Captain America figure to tie-in the analogy.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nIn therapy, Ben talks withDr. Ashley Kafkaabout a dream he has with hisUnclefrom a time he stole a pack of gum. But unable to see his uncle's erased face, Kafka's ring technology restores his face and allows Ben to make an emotional breakthrough. Later that night, Ben andJanineget dressed for date night and take a self-driving car. But as they're about to have a kiss, Ben reluctantly answers a call byMarcusabout Doc Ock, having breached many of their data servers in the Midtown Branch. With the order to suit up by Maxine herself, Ben is told to go by an understanding Janine, and he promises to rendezvous back at their apartment later.\nAt the Beyond site, Doc Ock makes his way through the security measures to finally reach an item holding all of Beyond's secrets, promising to enact revenge on the company for stealing his secrets. However, Spider-Man arrives to kick Doc Ock in the face, then greets Doug upon seeing him before sending him and Keith to somewhere safer. Doc Ock elaborates how Beyond took something of his without notice until he investigated them further, pondering how far could their lies and deceptions go. When Ben comments howKravensaw corporations were bad, Doc Ock expresses how corporations are good for revenue and manipulation until his arms deactivate from a small device Spider-Man planted on him.\nUndeterred, Doc Ock removes his suit and arms to make his way to the device he wanted, and triggers the security system to target Spider-Man. Pelted by non-lethal rounds, Spider-Man is overwhelmed by the defenses until he is knocked unconscious, underwhelming Doc Ock's expectations. Taking his leave, Doc Ock advises the out-cold Spider-Man that Beyond hire someone more qualified by his return. Ben wakes up in a medbay later, updated by Marcus that he was out for thirty minutes so there's still time to locate Doc Ock. Ben's guilt still weighs on him, feeling he let everyone down from Doc Ock's escape with the device.\nWhile Marcus tries cheering him up,Maxinesoon calls on hologram voicing her disappointment that ben couldn't best Doc Ock, when someone like the \"legacy\" Spider-Man routinely could. Demanding the drive back, Ben requests to know whats on it but Maxine refuses to give more details to Ben's functioning as an asset. Ben's attempt to correct her is met with doubling down that he is indeed an asset, slowly building into a liability, and explaining that the drive has information that would haunt Beyond and everyone working for them in perpetuity.\nThe Spider-EpicBeyondcontinues!\nDoctor Octopus is on a collision course with the Beyond Corporation and their Spider-Hero in residence. Ben Reilly isn’t the only one with new tricks up his sleeve, or, in Ock’s case, many sleeves!\nPlus, Peter Parker is on the mend but is he ready to be Spider-Man again?!"

For most, there’s enough going on in the world that Doom’s absence is not a priority, and some time without him feels like a blessing.  Only a few recognize it for what it truly was…the calm before the storm. It is a storm that has now arrived. The world has woken up to a new reality: Doctor Doom, Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme, has magically taken over every broadcast medium on the planet and declared himself Emperor of the World – the ruler of a new United Latveria!  And shockingly, impossibly, all of Earth’s leaders seem to be going along with this. Luckily, whether it’s mind control or Doombots, whatever’s affecting them hasn’t affected Earth’s heroes – and so they quickly form a strike team to stop Doom’s machinations."

Just when it seems they have her cornered, Phoenix intervenes and demolishes their car while Nightcrawler grabs Kitty and carries her up to the roof of a warehouse. Scott is upset at the force Phoenix exerted in taking out the Club’s minions, but she counters that she was herself was upset at just how much they terrified Kitty. Dazzler, meanwhile, cannot believe she is tagging along with a bunch of real superheroes.\nPhoenix then spirits all three of them to the rooftop where Nightcrawler relates how Kitty used her phasing ability to elude her. Panicking, Kitty tries to hide from the X-Men until Jean approaches her and wins her trust.\nIn the Hellfire Club’s hovercraft (which has been commandeered by the X-Men), Cyclops tends to Kitty’s wounds and listens to her recount how the other X-Men were taken prisoner by the White Queen. Nightcrawler silently laments that Kitty seems afraid of him. Cyclops formulates a plan to rescue the captive X-Men and asks for Kitty and Dazzler’s assistance.\nSoon enough, the car used to tail Kitty pulls up to the gates of Frost Industries’ Chicago branch and the Club soldiers sent out after Kitty appear to have captured the remaining X-Men (Cyclops, Phoenix and Nightcrawler) as well as Dazzler. It’s all a trick, however, as Jean is telepathically causing the guards to see what she wants them to see. The car is allowed entrance to the base’s grounds.\nObserving this on a monitor, the White Queen is suspicious but not immediately alarmed. Confidant that if it is a trick, she can easily defeat the other X-Men, she resumes her painful telepathic interrogation of Storm.\nMeanwhile, Kitty uses her phasing ability to once again sneak into the room where the other X-Men are held captive. With Storm gone, she manages to free Wolverine by phasing her hand through his cage’s lock. As she helps a still-groggy Wolverine out of his cage, she is waylaid by a guard who then orders Wolverine to get back in the cage. Instead, Wolverine pops his claws and advises the guard to say his prayers.\nAt the same time, the free X-Men drop the facade and go on the offensive. Cyclops blasts the roof off the car with an optic beam. Dazzler quickly springs up and uses her light-show powers to overwhelm the guards’ senses, leaving them in a catatonic state. A battle erupts between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club rank & file.\nThe White Queen is outraged and tells Storm that as payback for the X-Men’s attack, she intends to wipe her mind clean, leaving her drooling zombie. Before she can carry out this threat, however, Phoenix confronts her and challenges her to a one-on-one duel.\nColossus (carrying a dazed Kitty) and Wolverine join the others as they fight their way out of the complex while Jean and White Queen are locked in a telepathic battle. Phoenix quickly overpowers her opponent. But Storm is nevertheless unnerved by Jean's show of power.\nOutside, the other X-Men have dealt with the rest of the troops and are searching for Phoenix and Storm when suddenly the complex explodes. Cyclops momentarily fears the worst, but then Phoenix emerges with Storm in tow, both of them unharmed. The White Queen, according to Phoenix, was not so lucky.\nHaving witnessed the battle from the sidelines, the Professor commends his X-Men for a job well done. The next day outside of the Pryde residence, Charles offers Dazzler a place with the X-Men. She politely declines, telling him that she was born to be a singer not a superhero. After she departs, Scott wonders aloud if they can trust her with their secrets. Xavier assures him they can.\nKitty's frantic parents emerge from the house. Kitty's mother is in tears, relieved that her daughter has been returned home safe and sound, while Kitty's father demands answers from Xavier about what they’ve been doing with his daughter all night. But then they quite abruptly change their tone and invite them all inside to discuss the school. Professor X appears as baffled by the about-face as everyone else. Jean confesses to Scott that she used her telepathic powers to alter the Pryde’s thinking and make them agree to let Kitty study at Xavier's school. She assures him there’s no real harm being done."

His representative tries to reassure him that he can get out soon within a year whereas he would have carried a mandatory five-year sentence. But Luke protests that he does not know what he is being convicted of, as he was sentenced at an \"administrative trial\" that even his representative does not know the details.\nBut one year later, Luke remains at Seagate and is constantly subjugated to physical abuse from the guards. During that time, Luke began working his body into shape by lifting weights. By 2010, Luke took an interest in reading anti-penal system literature. In 2014, the guards confronted Luke for forming his own prison gang. Luke tries to explain that it was a reading group, but the guards viciously club him as they accuse him for being a troublemaker and a dangerous element.\nIn January 2024, Luke is awakened from his sleep by the appearance of a Stark Box sent by Tony Stark from six months into the future. The Stark recording explains the life Luke was meant to have and is given the chance to free the world from theMaker's Council. Through Stark's ionic catalyst, Luke gains superhuman strength and unbreakable skin. With his new powers, Luke causes an uprising and leads the inmates to take over the prison. Several months later in June, Iron Lad visits Luke and offers to welcome him to the Ultimates. However, Luke declines to join the team but instead he can do much better at dismantling the Maker’s systems from within.\nIn February 2025, Luke has himself transferred to the Gordium Correctional Facility, a Midas Group Penitentiary specializing in the \"for-profit-prison space.\" Luke and the other prisoners have their global citizenship officially revoked and they have no rights of any kind within the facility. They must obey the guards and follow the rules in order to stay out of trouble. Luke saves fellow inmate Danny Reid from being knifed from behind. Luke befriends Danny and invites him to his reading session, in which expresses his criticisms of the penal system. Soon he convinces Danny and some of the inmates to plan a prison break.\nThe guards quickly learn of the planned prison break and they bring Luke and his cohort to be executed by firing squad. But the guards learned their unfortunate mistake as their bullets do not leave scratch or mark on Luke. In turn Luke easily breaks his chains free and begins attacking the guards. It is then revealed that it is all part of Luke's real plan to stage another takeover, which he had already done in other prisons prior to entering Gordium.\nAs the riot in Gordium continues into its third day, Lejori privately talks to a comatose Tony Stark. She tells Tony to stay strong while recounting how her transformation into a She-Hulk was a very painful process that she was able to overcome due to a promise to protect her people. Now it is why she cannot allow Tony to die because he made a promise to her and her people so he can help them. After finishing her words, Lejori leaves Tony. Moments later Tony opens his eyes.\nNine months remaining...\nLUKE CAGE AND THE ULTIMATE PRISON BREAK!\n• Juan Frigeri joins Deniz Camp to bring us the history and the future of Luke Cage!"

Marcus mentions that Squid Kid made him late for his date before Kid Juggernaut smashes into the room. Squid Kid asks if the two are dating, but Kid Juggernaut insists that their relationship is merely professional in order to keep his true identity hidden from both the villain and Marcus. Kid Juggernaut easily destroys the interface and closes the portal, rescuing Marcus and capturing Squid Kid before quickly disappearing and returning to the scene in civilian clothes as Justin Jin for his date with Marcus. Though Marcus easily sees through his maneuver, he elects to wait for Justin to reveal himself. Many more dates are interrupted by villainous attacks and heroic rescues by Kid Juggernaut, never coming clean about his true identity. He even enlists his fellow Academy students to pose with a cutout of his heroic counterpart to show himself as a different person. On their tenth date, Marcus confronts Justin, asking him if there is anything he wants to tell him. Citing concerns for the safety of his friends, Justin tells Marcus he isn't ready to be open with his secret. Marcus agrees to wait, but not forever, before an incursion by Nyarla-Gorath prompts Marcus to make an excuse for Justin to run off and save the day."

Garrg thought the lake was his and wanted to fight Thor for possession of it.

But then, the Living Laser vanishes suddenly. Concerned that other past Avengers foes may be \"escaping\" in such a manner, Iron Man calls a meeting of all Avengers -- much to the surprise of his team mates since he is not an active member of the team at the time.\nIt is revealed that the Living Laser had been teleported away by the Mandarin. He has gathered together the Swordsman, Power Man, the Executioner and the Enchantress. They are instructed to aid his master plan by attacking a variety of locations all over the world. To ensure his lackeys stay in line, the Mandarin pretends to teleport the Sub-Mariner to his base as well. When Namor refuses to obey orders, the Mandarin summarily destroys him. It's all an illusion meant to frighten the villains into behaving, but it works; they all fall in line.\nWhen Iron Man arrives at Avengers Mansion, he's attacked by Hercules who doesn't know him and mistakes him for a villain. Their brief skirmish is halted by Thor's arrival, who introduces the two heroes and assures them both that they are all on the same side. Nick Fury contacts the Avengers and relates how several of their past opponents are staging attacks around the world in what appears to be a concerted effort. The Avengers break up into teams to confront the villains.\nPART TWO: TO PERISH BY THE SWORDIron Man, Goliath, and the Wasp deal with Power Man and the Swordsman. Iron Man prevents the Swordsman from crushing a city with a colossal sword.\nPART THREE: STRUGGLE IN A STRANGE LANDHercules and the Scarlet Witch stop the Executioner and Enchantress.\nPART FOUR: AND A MONSTER SHALL STALK THE LANDThor and Hawkeye deal with Living Laser who is aided by Mandarin's giant robot Ultimo. But they defeat him as well.\nPART FIVE: SHOWDOWN IN SPACECaptain America and Quicksilver confront the Mandarin in his space station. Soon enough, they are joined by the rest of the Avengers. The Mandarin uses a hate ray on them, causing them to fight whoever they are closest to. The Wasp, however, is closer to the Mandarin. She attacks him and the hate ray is deactivated. The Mandarin tries again to defeat them with another ray, but it blows a hole in the wall and sucks him out into space. The Avengers plant a bomb and destroy the base after leaving.\nAs the team returns to Earth in a shuttle, Iron Man remarks on how the entire team of Avengers ought to assemble more often. The Scarlet Witch chimes in that she hopes it doesn't have to take a villain such as the Mandarin to unite them all in the future.\nFeatured Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nA one page Pin-Up featuringHercules.\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nVehicles:\nEvents:\nA two page diagram featuring the inner workings of theAvengers Mansion.\nFeatured Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nItems:\nA one-page pin-up featuring the femaleAvengers:Black Widow,Scarlet Witch, and theWasp.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nItems:\nA one-page pin-up featuring theAvengers, both the original line-up and the new line-up."

Thor manages to free himself from Kurse, while Sif engages Malekith himself.  Thor goes to find the Gem of Infinite Suns, which has the power to free them all, and has Sif lead Malekith away.  In Odin's bedchamber, Thor opens Odin's treasures and retrieves the gem.  Using its power, Thor destroys Pentigaar, and then frees Asgard from its icy tomb.  Thor then slams the gem into the face of Kurse, freeing him from Malekith's spell, and uses its power to close the Cask of Ancient Winters.  Thor takes the gem and wraps it around the cask, then sends them both away to an unknown dimension.  Before Thor is about to smite Malekith, Sif intervenes and claims that right for stealing a kiss from her.  Thor and Bill then return to Jake Olson's apartment in Soho, and just after changing into Jake, they are greeted by Jake's mother.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nAfter an encounter with Heimdall (which further startles Jane), Thor takes his love to meet Odin. The encounter has Jane completely in awe. Odin, in honour of Thor and Jane's impending marriage, uses his powers to transform Jane into a god just like they are. As well as being imbued with immortality, Jane also learns that she can fly, however she lacks the necessary skill to stay aloft and Thor must come to her rescue.\nAs a final test of her worth, Jane is locked in a room to face the Unknown to see if she has the courage to be among the gods. However, Jane is horrified by the creature and cowers away from it in utter fear, forcing Thor to come to her rescue and fight the monster off. Finding everything too much, Jane demands to be changed back to normal and return to her normal life with no memory of Asgard. Odin complies with her wish, in spite of Thor's protests, and Jane is shunted back to Earth.\nWhen Thor continues to protest Odin's decision, the All-Father exerts his will upon his son who ultimately accepts Jane's fate. Odin then sends Thor to the realm of Gundershelm to protect the Glade of Crystals from attack. Thor is transported there where he defends the Glade from an attack by Trolls, while back on Earth, Jane Foster suddenly appears in a hospital.\nShe has been restored to human form, and has no memory what happened in Asgard, however Odin had manipulated events so that Jane would soon be hired on as a nurse for Dr. Kincaid, whom Jane instantly finds attractive.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nKurse (Algrim the Elf, resurrected by the Beyonder) has been defeated in combat against the Power Pack[1]. Buried under tons of rubble from a collapsed building, the powerful creature may be defeated but he is far from dead. Recalling his battle with Beta Ray Bill[2]and the Power children causes the creature to stir and break free from his environment to continue seeking out his mortal enemy Thor. Meanwhile, Thor has returned to Manhattan from Asgard with the souls that were stolen by Malekith[3]and uses the power of Mjolnir to send them back to their mortal bodies. Thor grimly thinks back to how his face was recently scarred by Hela during his latest trials[4]while parking his chariot in a nearby alley so that he can find solitude in the city. Walking out of the alley, Thor is begged for change by some of the city homeless. When they are complaining about him not having any, Thor angrily yells at them as he had saved their lives countless times in the past and frightens them off by showing them his facial scars. The incident deeply upsets Thor, and he wonders if it is finally time for him to swear off Midgard and return to home for good.\nAs Kurse resumes his rampage, the Power Pack have sneaked out of their parents home and brought Tattletale from Avengers Mansion so that they can search for others that were hurt during Kurse's rampage earlier that day. They come across Beta Ray Bill, who is just reviving from his fight against Kurse. When they check to see if he is okay, they learn that they have a mutual enemy and that he has not been vanquished. Telling the Power Pack that Thor has returned to Earth, Lightspeed flies off to locate him so that she can warn him of Kurse while the others search for the rampaging monster.\nMeanwhile, on Asgard, Loki begins another new plot against his brother Thor. Once more using his cosmic transmuter, he fires a powerful mystical blast to Earth, striking a woman ironing her clothes in Manhattan. On Earth, this beam of energy streaks past the oceanic base of the Beyonder who is intrigued by it. Using his powers, he learns that it is meant for Thor. Taking his monitoring devices to look at the Thunder God, the Beyonder is surprised to see that Kurse has just found the pondering, god. Although he no longer is interested in the battle's outcome, the Beyonder decides to see his previous experiment through to the end anyway and watches as Kurse and Thor battle it out. As Thor defends himself from Kurse, he realizes he's battle Algrim. Upon mentioning Algrim's name, causes Kurse to go into another berserker rage and renew his attack. Back on Asgard, Rolfe and Flosi are playing games with their younger sister Hilde. They chase her into the wild area. There they stumble upon Suturs sword[5]and see a giant device siphoning energy from it. Believing this could be trouble, the three children run back to the city to warn Heimdall.\nThe battle against Kurse is not fairing well for Thor at his usual strength. Realizing more power is needed he rushes back to his chariot where he recovers his Belt of Strength and puts it own. Even with his enhanced strength, he finds that Kurse is able to still match his abilities. The Beyonder at this point has appeared over the battle and finds Thor's resolve and code of honor interesting. Curious, the Beyonder sees what would happen by increasing Kurse's powers even more. Thor is easily trounced but does not give up, making the Beyonder wonder what sort of desire keep Thor fighting against impossible odds. He is even more confused when Beta Ray Bill and the Power Pack arrive to help him out, considering Thor has no idea who the Power children are.\nThe children lend Thor a hand and in the course of the battle, Kurse realizes that his true enemy, the one responsible for his current state is in reality Malekith. Although Kurse realizes who his true foe is, Thor comes to the decision that such unchecked rage would be a danger and works with the Power children to defeat Kurse. They get Energizer to use her powers on Mjolnir and Storm-Bringer, even though it will at least weaken -- if not destroy -- Thor and Beta Ray Bill's weapons. Katie absorbs as much power as she can handle and when it becomes too painful she fires a bolt of energy that knocks Kurse out.\nWith the battle over, the Beyonder makes his presence known and takes away the extra power he gave Kurse. He is about to destroy the creature when Thor tells him not to, that Kurse could be better use helping end Malekith's tyranny and so the Beyonder sends the creature back to Asgard. When Franklin tells the other members of the Power Pack that the Beyonder was responsible for creating Kurse the children become upset -- feeling betrayed that the Beyonder was responsible for creating the creature that injured their mother. When Katie lashes out at him, the Beyonder tells the children that he realizes that there the only thing that makes the difference between good and evil is a choice. Seeing the consequences of being evil, the Beyonder decides that he will do only good and uses his powers to restore Mjolnir and Storm Bringer to their full power again before teleporting off. The Power children are upset that the Beyonder left before he could help their mother and are taken home by Beta Ray Bill.\nWeary from the battle, Thor decides to return to Asgard after all, but before he can the woman transmuted by Loki approaches him and kisses Thor. There is a flash of energy leaving the woman with no memory of what she has done, unaware that she has succeed in carrying out Loki's current scheme: turning Thor into a frog!\n\nSecret Wars II continues inPower Man and Iron Fist#121...\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nEvents:\nOdin has summoned Thor and his crew back to Asgard to prepare for the coming of Ragnarok.

Balder and the Warriors Three go out to defend their home while Thor tells Sif the origins of Infinity:\nThor recounts the time that Loki had sent Odin's body to the Sea of Eternal Sleep during a time that Loki briefly usurped control of Asgard. During this time Hela appeared before Odin and attempted to take his soul, however was only able to take a portion of it. Allowing Balder to rescue Odin during this time, Hela would then fashion this stolen portion -- which she dubbed Infinity -- into the being that it is now known as in the hopes of taking over the entire universe.\nAs the chaos continues, the heroes are told that Infinity hopes to merge with Odin, something that they cannot allow. In order to achieve this undisturbed Thor summons a powerful storm that sweeps away the attacking Trolls and Giants out of the kingdom. Loki and Karnilla channel their powers together to try and free Odin from Infinity's thrall however it is all for naught as Odin continues to be controlled by his evil doppelganger.\nRegrouping at the Odinsword, they attempt another attempt at freeing Odin, charging Thor's hammer with Karnilla's magic, Thor rockets into the World Beyond and strikes both Odin and Infinity, separating them. This also snaps Odin out of Infinity's control, allowing the All-Father to regain his wits and destroy Infinity. Returning to Asgard, Odin is hailed by his people.

The gods were confident of victory: theRaven Bannerhad spread to the wind, and its magic was such that any side that bore it into battle was assured victory, though the bearer was certain to die. In this battle, that honor belonged toGrim Magnus, a god whose forefathers had born the banner for centuries. Just as the giant Snorth slew Grim Magnus, the battle turned decisively against his troops, and they were forced to retreat. Later, a trio a of tunneling trolls snatch the banner from the field before any of the gods noticed them, and concealed their escape with a small illusion. When a host of Valkyries led bySygnetarrive to collect the honored dead, they assume thatGreyval-- Grim Magnus' son and Sygnet's betrothed -- has already retrieved the banner.\nUnfortunately, Greyval Grimson is at that moment converting with the trolls in their underground lair. The god and trolls drink mead, frolic with elves, and trade tails of past hunts. Askella, a troll sorceress, arrives with news of the battle's conclusion, and Asgard's victory. The Raven Banner is gone, probably collected by some other god. Greyval mourns the loss of his father, but is content to be rid of the banner. Let another godly family claim the banner, and with it the glory of certain death in battle for Asgard. He is offered the fruit of the Trollvine, which would make him a troll and allow him to remain and frolic in their lair forever. At this point he comes to his senses: he promised his father that he would marry Sygnet on the eve of his death, a final tribute to his glory (and continuing the family line). Behind the illusion, Askella consults the troll king: Greyval is completely taken in by their illusions of a grand banquet hall, believes that the gods have redeemed the banner, and that the trolls rejoice in the gods' victory. She suggests that he be allowed to leave, for she has had a vision of him returning, \"to kneel as a vassal at our feet 'til the Bottomless Abyss of Shadows fills with blood.\"\nSygnet and Greyval join in a hand-fast marriage, and their is much rejoicing among the gods. Greyval has been telling stories of the battle, claiming to have slain five (or maybe ten, or even fifteen) giants. Greyval and Horskuld bet on a fight between their horses, which Horskuld's black stallion wins. The celebration is marred when Valkyries arrive with the news that the Raven Banner has not been found.Odinbelieves that the giants may have stolen it, and that Greyval has committed a grave oversight by leaving it behind. The crowd turns on Greyval, but Sygnet silences them, saying that Greyval will petition the All-Father for the right to seek out and retrieve the banner.\nThe next day, Greyval and Sygnet travel from their farm on the plain of Ida to the gleaming city of Asgard. Their they meet Horskuld, who has already received permission from Odin to quest for the banner. Sygnet is dismayed, but Grey is pleased: he may not have to die after all. Just then,Balderarrives, and agrees to help Greyval get an audience with Odin. Inside, Greyval confesses his doubts to Balder. When the battle was about to begin, a cadre of trolls snatched his sword and ran off laughing. After he was lured into their kingdom, he found himself singing and dancing without a care. They swore that some other god would reclaim the banner, and he would not have to die. Now he has doomed the kingdom and lost Sygnet forever, for why would Odin grant a cowards plea? Hearing all this, Balder tells Greyval that fear of death is not cowardly; fear must be conquered as one claims his destiny. The land of trolls, he claims, is a prison of deceits, but Greyval had the will to overcome it and leave. The two go to meet Odin, who agrees to allow Greyval to hunt for the banner, and for Balder to accompany him. Morduk, speaking for the sages, tells Greyval he must first go to Valhalla meet his father's shade, who will guide him from there. Greyval wonders if Horskuld won't find the banner first, but Morduk is doubtful that the arrogant, untrusting god will get anywhere unless he stumbles onto a clue by sheer luck. Balder contactsAgnar, King of the Eagles, who agrees to fly the pair to Valhalla.\nMeanwhile, Odin has retreated to Hlidskjalf, the tallest mountain peak in the universe, where he seeks peace in solitude. His wife, Frigga, has managed to find him, however, and he confides his fears in her. The peace Asgard has had until now seems but the prelude to a terrible storm. If theOgreshave the Raven banner, woven by \"Time's father's father\", then the time of Ragnarok may be upon them. The Fates have decreed that only a god of Grim Magnus' line can retrieve the banner. That leaves only Horskuld, who is filled with the type of pride that usually precedes a fall, and Greyval, who is not cowardly, but riddled with self-doubt.\nBorn by Agnar, Greyval and Balder soon reach the Enchanted Chasm separating Valhalla from the rest of the golden realm. Agnar will fly no further; not even he will brave the chasm's enchanted mists. The pair begin a slow climb down a robe woven of thorny vines. Reaching the bottom, the pair hear a voice somewhere in the distance, bemoaning his fate. \"Oh I am lost and none can help, for soon the monster eats me bone and blood.\" The pair soon encounter the beast the voice speaks of, a gigantic Ogre. The creature knocks Balder from the stone bridge they were crossing, leaving him hanging. Greyval takes advantage by slashing the Ogre's ankle, leaving it hobbled, and allowing the two gods manage to escape. It is then that the pair meet the Ogre's captive (and dinner), the loquaciousOddbrand Otter, an otter-god who accompanies them out of the chasm.\nAs they pass out of the chasm, they come to Valhalla, where the honored dead are joined in joyous battle. One god is not battling, however. Grim Magnus, who is aware of everything that has transpired since his death, cannot bring himself to battle, knowing that his son is a coward. Greyval begs for forgiveness and counsel, swearing he will retrieve the banner and win fame's undying glory. Hopeful, Grim Magnus tells his son that he must first sojourn alone intoHel, realm of the un-honored dead, and then seek out theNornsin their forest. Only then will they tell him how to find the banner.\nGreyval journeys through Hel, ferrying across its stagnant river filled with corpses, past the guardian hel-houndGarm, through the catacombs of flame, and past the great Devouring Dragon, who swallows up the souls of the honorless dead. He also encountersHela, who with a single tough shrivels his form into that of an old, feeble man, showing him what he will become if his courage fails. Horrified, Greyval swears this will not be his fate. He returns to Valhalla to retrieve Oddbrand and Balder, and the three depart for the Norn Forest.\nElsewhere, Horskuld circles the woods looking for a clue. A voice calls out to him, telling him the banner can be his if he only proves himself worthy. Horskuld proves his worth by slaying a doe and her fawn, just as the voice commands. The troll Otny springs from the blood, telling him he has indeed proven himself worthy.\nBy this point the trio of gods has reached the Sea of Marmora, which they must cross to reach the Norn's Forest. On the shore they meet a widow and her young son, who agree to ferry them to the far shore. When the gods think they've finally got a chance to rest, the widow and child are revealed as the trolls Askella and Svin in disguise. Svin lunges at Greyval, who runs the troll through. Askella summons a wind giant, who wrecks the small ship. Askella transforms into a mist, leaving the three to drown. Oddbrand saves the day when he pulls a bottle from his bag, sucking in the wind giant and imprisoning him. The bag, he explains, is a Bag of Wonders, which is enchanted to have just what you need when you need it (whenever you remember to wish for it, that is). The three wash up on the far shore, and continue their quest.\nElsewhere, Horskuld gazes into the troll's Pool of Mirrors, which shows him proud Sygnet being tricked and subdued by the trolls. Horskuld, desiring Sygnet for himself, he agrees to follow the trolls, who will provide him with the Raven Banner she so admires.\nHaving at last come toYggdrasill, the World Tree. Balder is summoned back to Asgard by Odin's Ravens, who inform him that the giants are on the march again. Greyval and Oddbrand continue on, reaching the Norns at the hear of Yggdrasill. Their the three fates tell him of the three paths before him: the swift safe road home to his farm, to live in eternal health and shame; the rash, rueful road to the Raven Banner, where his new bravery will be tested; or the longest path, to save Sygnet, who is held in the land of rock trolls. Greyval chooses the longest, the hero's path to save Sygnet. The Norns are pleased by the choice, and inform him that Odin has sent his boar, Gullinbursti, to speed him on his way. Mounting the boar, Greyval and Oddbrand fly for the land of the rock trolls.\nIn the land of the rock trolls itself, Horskuld has fallen to the temptation Greyval had avoided, vowing to stay on as a prince of the trolls, with Sygnet as his queen.\nGreyval comes to Sygnet's prison, a cave guarded by Snorth, the same giant who slew his father! Greyval decapitates the giant after a long battle, scattering his troll allies. Inside, Greyval finds and embraces Sygnet. When Oddbrand notices that she casts a menacing shadow, Greyval knows that Askella is trying to deceive him again. Freeing the real Sygnet, Greyval throws Askella into her cell, and tells Oddbrand to loose the key in his bag. He then goes to retrieve the Raven Banner, leaving Sygnet and Oddbrand behind to run for Asgard.\nNot far a way, Horskuld dons his armor, and prepares to lead his new armies into battle. To proud to admit any other warrior is as fine as he, he will bear the Raven Banner, leading his troops to victory. The troll king smiles at how gullible the god is, looking forward to a lifetime of hedonistic bliss even as he throws his life away. Horskuld descends into the Bottomless Abyss of Shadows, unaware that his cousin has penetrated the chamber above. Gullinbursti's light shatters the troll illusion, revealing their grand banquet hall to be nothing but a nestle of thorns.\nDescending, he finds a figure clad in purple armor. They duel, and eventually Greyval lands a paltry blow against the troll prince's helmet. It is only then that the troll prince reveals himself as Horskuld. The warrior in purple knocks Greyval to his knees, pinning his sword. As Horskuld comes close to gloat, Grey drives his dagger into the prince's throat. He stumbles into the black abyss, filling it with his blood, fulfilling the witch's prophecy. Greyval takes the Raven Banner, and fly for Asgard.\nBack in Asgard, the battle is going poorly for the gods, who are assailed by every giant of the land. The giants boast that Fenris will swallow the moon, that Ragnarok has come at last. The gods fear it is not an idle boast, until Greyval Grimson arrives, unfurling the Raven Banner. The battle turns in the gods' favor, and the giants are routed.\nAfter the battle, Balder and Oddbrand find Greyval full of arrows. Sygnet takes his body to Valhalla, and entrusts the banner to Balder until the son conceived on her wedding night comes of age to claim his birthright."

Foster, in a panic, tells Thor not to seek revenge on Blake, as he was likely frightened and that she still loved him. Thor, \"convinced\" not to seek \"revenge\" on Blake, leaves Foster to bask in the joy of knowing that Jane Foster loves his alter ego.\nMeanwhile, a transcontinental plane from France lands at JFK airport and a lone man exits the plane. When an airport official boards the craft to check on the other passengers, he finds that they have all been turned to stone.\nThis man is revealed to be Paul Duval, a young chemist from Paris who one day, while being rushed to complete a chemical solution, spilled its contents on his hand. Duval soon found that his hand had turned to stone, and consequently, anything he touched would also turn to stone, including himself (although unlike his future victims, when he turned to stone he was not immobilized). Duval soon began a crime spree, turning jewelers and bank guards into stone and stealing what he wanted. Growing bored with his wealth, Duval learned about Thor's recent battle against the Cobra and Mr. Hyde. He decided to steal Thor's immortality, figuring the power must come from Thor's hammer, and traveled to America to do so.\nThe flashback ends when the Duval's cab arrives in the center of New York City. Duval turns the driver into stone and waits for Thor to take the bait. Thor eventually overhears a radio report about the rash of reports of people being turned into stone. Investigating the most recent report of the cab driver, Thor uses his Avengers priority to have the stone cabbie taken to Donald Blake's office. As Don Blake, Thor examines the the stone cabbie and determines that within the hour he will turn back to normal. He vows to Jane Foster that he will learn why these people are suddenly turning to stone.\nMeanwhile, Duval has donned a costume and turned his body into stone, calling himself the Grey Gargoyle. He goes to Dr. Blake's office in the hope that Thor will appear. He attacks Blake and attempts to turn him into stone; however, Donald manages to escape to the roof of his office and change into Thor.\nThe two titans battle in the streets, where the Grey Gargoyle causes a nearby gas pump of Marvel Oil to explode, knocking Thor's hammer out of his grasp. He fails to lift Thor's hammer and turns its owner into stone when the thunder god attempts to grab it back. The police soon arrive with a flame thrower and chase the Gargoyle away. While the police are busy, the stone statue of Thor falls over and his hammer strikes the ground, causing him to change back to Donald Blake.\nBlake dares not change into Thor until the Gargoyle's stone spell wears off. He thinks that it would last for twenty-four hours, and decides to defeat the Grey Gargoyle in his mortal guise. Using his connections with the Avengers, Blake obtains a projector camera from Stark Industries that allows him to project a 3-D image of Thor. Mounting the camera to a motorcycle, Blake travels around the city, projecting an image of Thor in an attempt to flush out the Grey Gargoyle.\nThe Gargoyle takes the bait, but soon figures out what Blake is attempting to do and chases after him. Blake then tricks the Grey Gargoyle into driving off a pier and into the Hudson River, where the current of a passing boat drags him out to sea, and he sinks to the bottom.\nThe next day, changing into Thor, the thunder god stops by Blake's office. He learns that the stone cab driver changed back to normal and Blake is being hailed as a hero, the story of the Gargoyle's defeat making the front page of the paper. Satisfied, Thor flies off into the sky.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nJealous of Balder being in favor of Odin next to Thor, Loki decides that he will kill Balder. Knowing that Odin gifted Balder with invincibility, Loki surmises that Balder must have some sort of weakness. He seeks out the Norn Queen in his attempt to find Balder's weakness.\nAt first the Norn Queen refuses to aid Loki, but eventually gives into Loki's demands and tells him that the only item in all of Asgard that did not pledge to protect Balder was mistletoe. With this knowledge in hand, Loki travels out and obtains a small amount of mistletoe and has one of his slave trolls fashion it into a dart and construct a blow gun.\nThe next day Loki spies Balder jousting in the combat practice fields and waits for the right moment to strike. Balder trips in an attempt to avoid stepping on a caterpillar and Loki uses it as an opportunity to fire the dart at him. Just as he is about to fire the dart, the blow gun bursts into flames in his hands. The Norn Queen contacts Loki via her crystal ball and informs him that although mistletoe did not pledge to protect Balder, she did, and thus thwarts his attempt to kill Balder. Loki pledges revenge, but the Norn Queen has her aide prepare witches's brew against any such attempt.\nBalder, meanwhile regains his feet, little knowing how close he was to losing his life."

Her most pressing task, though, is to defeat the Olympian godHerculesin an arm wrestling competition in a bar inChelsea: should he win, he'd be allowed to kiss her; should she win, Hercules and the other Olympians would fight alongside her. The match is suddenly taken to an end by theOdinson, who smashes their table with his axe and urges Thor toAsgardiawith him, for he needs to show her something. By the way, Hercules agrees to help Thor in her fight even though the fight hasn't technically seen a winner.\nIn Asgardia, Odinson shows Thor what is left ofVolstagg, in a comatose state afterhis fightwithMangoginOld Asgard. Odinson explains who the threat is to Thor, who'd only heard of it in \"whispers\", and as she says she's ready to face this new menace too, Odinson actually urges her to take time from thehammerand undergo her treatments for her cancer. Thor seems to be convinced, as she throws the hammer away and turns to her human form, but she has different intentions.\nJane walks towardsOdin's Castle, calling him a coward for staying hidden inside of it instead of facing the problems at hand and considering that maybe it would be better to find a new all-father or, rather,all-mother. She then addresses the Asgardians, saying that they need to fight alongside the populations of theNine Realmsso that the war may end. Her speech is cut short byCul, Odin's brother and current regent of Asgard, who reports a sedition going on. Jane, Odinson and the other Asgardians stand up to him, though, causing Odin himself to thrust the doors of his Castle open and intervene. He first addresses his brother, reprimanding him for his incompetence, but then he turns on Jane, saying she andher raceare \"the most arrogant fleas to ever infest the cosmos\". He concludes by saying he won't be lectured by her or anyone else, as he's the All-Father and thus his will must be followed. Suddenly,Freyjashows up, awakened from her deathly slumber by Jane's words: she says the human is right and that the Asgardians need to follow her. As the All-Mother speaks so, Jane collapses to the ground.\nAt theBifrost,Heimdalldeclares that he has seen many a war and the destruction of entire galaxies, but also that what is about to happen will be difficult to watch for him, too: in front of him stands the monstruous Mangog, ready to kill all the Gods in his path.\nTHE DEATH OF THE MIGHTY THOR Part 3"

For an inexplicable reason, the Hulk transforms back into Bruce Banner in mid-leap and begins falling to his doom. On a lower ledge of the chasm, the Enchantress and the Executioner watch the mortal plummet towards certain death. The Enchantress suspects that this mortal might have connections to her (would-be) lover, Hercules, and uses her power to save Banner's life.\nAt the top of the chasm, the Warriors Three look downward, convinced that the Hulk has met his doom. They continue on their journey to the Forbidden Forest to seek the council of Oldar the Oracle. The aged crone reveals that the Hulk has not perished, and she creates a window in time, through which she reveals how Bruce Banner first became the Hulk. Knowing that the Hulk is still alive, the Warriors grow concerned that he might threaten the Realm Eternal. Leaving the lair of Oldar the Oracle, they make haste towards Asgard.\nThe Enchantress and the Executioner meanwhile keep vigil over the unconscious Bruce Banner. When Banner revives, he turns into the Hulk and begins fighting with the Executioner. The Executioner strikes him with his Bloodaxe, but this proves ineffective against the Hulk. The Hulk manages to stagger his foe with one crushing blow to the jaw. The Enchantress grows bored watching the two combatants fight one another and teleports herself and the Executioner to a safe distance.\nThe Enchantress calls together a massive army of trolls and leads them on a quest to overtake Asgard. The Hulk gets involved in the fight, and keeps the trolls at bay by sealing them inside of a rocky cavern. Enraged, the Enchantress turns her magic against the Hulk and kills him.\nThe Warriors Three, along with Odin recover the Hulk's body after the battle is over. Admiring the Hulk's bravado, Odin uses his Scepter of Strength to bring the Hulk back to life. The Hulk is confused and angry and trusts no one. He threatens to attack Odin, little realizing that the All-Father is responsible for bringing him back from the dead. Angered by the Hulk's lack of gratitude, Odin uses his power to teleport the Hulk away from Asgard into the depths of outer space."

Thinking that it's Hela's doing, violating her promise she would not take another person's life if she has his, Thor teleports away and tries to escape Hela. No matter where Thor goes, Hela is waiting there prompting Thor to try harder and hard to get away from her.\nFinally returning to New York, Odin appears before them and demands that Hela not take Thor's life. When she refuses to comply, Odin slays her with his Power Scepter. Thor is horrified by what Odin has done because he has doomed everyone in the universe to live in a realm without death, and that the world would soon overpopulate and chaos would spread everywhere. Realizing the worst is happening, Odin agrees with Thor and uses his power to restore Hela to life.\nWith no other choice, Thor accepts his fate and allows Hela to touch him. As he begins to wither and die, the emotional Odin transports Sif to Earth so that she might spend her lovers last moments together. With Thor dying, Sif decides to try and appeal to Hela's feminine spirit and manages to touch her feelings. Hela is truly moved when Sif offers herself in sacrifice so that Thor may life. This brings tears to Hela's eyes who is moved enough to change her mind and restores Thor to life. Hela soon departs telling those gathered that someday they will eventually feel her embrace.\nReturning to Asgard, Odin, Sif and Thor are shocked to find a giant in Heimdal's place guarding the Bifrost Bridge. Thor easily dispatches the giant and they find that the kingdom has been taken over by Loki, who took advantage of the fact that Odin left his Odinring behind while on Earth. Rightful ruler due to the fact that he is wearing this ring, Loki orders all the people of Asgard to prepare for a war of conquest, and that their first target is the planet Earth."

Thor calls down a thunderstorm that douses the Human Torch's flame, but the rain only serves to rejuvenate the Sub-Mariner who begins grappling with the Thunder God. Russian soldiers open fire on Thor, but he shatters the barrels of their tanks with one swift stroke from his hammer Mjolnir.

On his patrol of the city, Thor receives the telepathic summons of Doctor Strange for his aid. Arriving at Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, he finds Doctor Strange passed out on the ground. Reviving him, Thor learns that Strange was severely weakened after stopping Baron Mordo from casting a spell on the city. Strange loses consciousness, prompting Thor to call for an ambulance and resume his mortal guise of Dr. Blake.\nAt the hospital, Blake preforms surgery on Doctor Strange. At that moment, Odin attempts to contact Thor telepathically, to ask him to aid his fellow Asgardians in battle. Blake chooses to ignore Odin's summons as he is in the middle of a surgery. This prompts Odin's wrath, causing an electrical storm on Earth that knocks out the power to the hospital. Blake is determined to continue the operation, and in Asgard, Odin leads his warriors into battle without Thor's aid. With Odin gone, Loki transforms himself into a bee and flies past Heimdall and crosses the Bifrost Bridge to Earth.\nLater, after Doctor Strange's surgery, Blake checks up on his patient, who offers to repay Blake for saving his life. Blake returns to his office, where Jane Foster shows him to an old man with a lame leg. The old man trips when standing up to greet Blake, so that he keels over and the two drop their canes. Getting back up and grabbing one of the canes and handing the other to Blake, the old man suddenly states that he is well, tossing the cane in his hand out a nearby window. The old man then transforms into Loki, who uses a magic mist to put Jane Foster to sleep. Blake attempts to change into Thor, but soon realizes that during the confusion, Loki had switched canes, and the one that would change him into Thor was tossed out the window. Loki grabs the unconscious Foster and leaps out of the window, taking her hostage.\nBlake, unable to find his cane, attempts to contact Odin, who doesn't answer his summons. He then enlists the aid of Doctor Strange, who uses his ectoplasmic form and mystic amulet to find the cane. Blake locates it near the harbor, where a bunch of hobos are using it for a fishing rod. Doctor Strange's ghost form scares the hobos into giving Blake back his cane. With Strange gone, Blake turns into Thor and begins his search for Loki. Meanwhile, Odin returns from battle and, feeling he was too harsh on his son, attempts to contact him again. Thor snaps at Odin for not responding to his request for aid, and tells Odin to leave him be.\nDuring his search for Foster, Thor runs into his fellow Avengers Iron Man, Giant-Man and the Wasp, who offer their aid. Thor turns them down, stating his quest is a private matter. He uses his hammer to locate Loki, who is hiding out in the Adirondack mountains.\nBefore confronting Loki, Thor contacts Doctor Strange mentally and asks him to use his magic to help save Jane from Loki. Confronting the god of mischief, Thor learns that Loki had banished Foster to Limbo and threatens to destroy her, should Thor attack. Thor battles Loki, until his foe knocks him into a pit that he set as a trap. Then Loki casts as spell that will kill Jane Foster and sends it into Limbo. However, his spell is blocked, due to a counter spell conjured by Doctor Strange.\nThor gets out of the pit and fights Loki into submission, forcing him to return Jane from Limbo. Just before Loki can attack again, a soldier from Asgard sent by Odin arrives and takes Loki back to Asgard. Odin contacts Thor and the two make peace.

In Grant Park inChicago,Don Blakeis out for a stroll, thinking about how sometimes he wishes he could set aside his godly heritage and be just a man, when he is struck in the back with a frisbee. Blake gives it back to John when he is grabbed by two men, who hustle him to a car and shove him in. Inside isNick Fury, who tells Blake he needs his help, or more to the point, Thor's help. They arrive at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier whereSitwellgives a briefing about the trouble they have. Using an advanced warp driven probe, they have discovered an alien ship. As the ship passes by a star, it flared to life and was sucked in by the ship, refueling it. The ship is now headed towards Earth at several times the speed of light. Thor agrees to help and begins his journey. InAsgard,Sifarrives to findVolstaggwithBalderfeasting. Balder is morose after his sojourn inHela's realm and has visibly gained weight. He has sworn to never fight again. Sif was wanting company since Thor has forsaken her for Earth, but she will not find it here.

In space, Thor has met up with the ship, and as he closes in on it, it's automated weapons open fire. Thor destroys the gun battery and rips his way through the hull. Inside, he finds a large figure encased in crystal, that suddenly breaks free. In Asgard, Loki is bored when he hears a noise. Outside, he sees warriors engaged in a forbidden Troll hunt. The Troll is hiding when it sees a beautiful woman offering to help hide it when she gets close, she grabs it and hoists it up.Loreleihas won the hunt. Loki invites her back to his castle and she agrees. Back aboard the ship, the gigantic alien tosses Thor aside and introduces himself asBeta Ray Bill.

He notes that not too long ago he would have been overcome with despair at being alone, but that he's not alone anymore. Dylan asks Eddie where they're going, Eddie replying that he's taking Dylan somewhere safe - noting that he chose to let Dylan believe they're half-brothers for the time being in light ofthe world falling apart. As aFire Demonrounds a corner and heads towards them, Eddie yanks Dylan into an alley and they wait for the monster to pass - Eddie shushing Dylan and thinking to himself that he has to be a better parent than his father.\nTaking shelter in a warehouse, Dylan notes that the news said thatAsgardinvadedEarth, and Eddie tells him they don't know for sure what's going on but that they need to lay low until it blows over. Eddie tells Dylan that they're going to a safehouse that belonged to a friend namedRex Strickland, but is interrupted by screams coming from outside. Seeing a group of civilians being chased by a trio of dark elves, Eddie tells Dylan to keep himself hidden while he intervenes. Dylan begs Eddie not to, saying he's not Venom anymore; but Eddie says that Venom or not he has to do something and is ten kinds of stupid. Approaching the trio of dark elves, Eddie yells at them to go away, the elves mocking his bravado as they surround him. Eddie manages to get a few good blows in - buying time for the elves' would-be victims to flee - but is slashed and impaled for his trouble. The dark elves mock Eddie  for thinking he - a mere human - could be a hero and stand against them, leaving him to bleed out as they depart to pursue the fleeing civilians. Dylan peeks out of his hiding space and is spotted by one of the elves. Dylan surrenders, but the dark elf gleefully replies that he doesn't take prisoners; Eddie grabbing him from behind and snapping his neck, to Dylan's discomfort. As Dylan supports Eddie, they are observed by Malekith's trio ofWar Witches, the tall and thin witch noting that Eddie has a warrior's bloodlust and rage but lacks the armor and weapons to unleash it. Her sisters caution her against meddling, but she ignores them.\nArriving at Rex's safehouse, Dylan notes that it doesn't look like much. In response, Eddie opens one of the hidden armories, Dylan marveling at the number of firearms. The tall war witch appears, remarking that mortal weapons are useless against her kind. Grabbing a pistol, Eddie aims it at her but she casually melts the gun with magic as a demonstration. Smiling sadistically, the war witch states she knows that a firearm isn't the weapon Eddie wants, conjuring a tall blue-white crystal and saying that it is. In response to Eddie's incredulity, the witch explains that the crystal is a dreamstone - a rare mystical object that becomes whatever its user desires - attuned to become a weapon. Dylan cautions Eddie against trusting her, but the witch tells Eddie that if he takes the dreamstone he will obtain the weapon he desires. Eddie reaches out and the dreamstone transforms into aVenom-like symbiote inscribed with Nordic runes and studded with crystal spikes; Eddie remarking that his new costume feels similar to yet different from the Venom symbiote. Dylan hesitantly asks if he's still himself, Eddie assuring him that he's alright. The war witch addresses Eddie, saying that the artificial symbiote is healing his wounds and that he now has the power to protect his loved ones, and in exchange he is to serve Malekith. As she reaches towards him, Eddie pretends to be obedient until she draws too close and then bites off her arm, the witch stammering that she never foresaw this and hurriedly teleporting away. As Eddie licks the blood from his fangs, he turns to Dylan - who is staring at him in disgust - and says that in order to fight monsters he had to become one again. Eddie gloats that the witch wanted him to serve Malekith but that he's going to use the power she gave him in order to fight the invasion, passing Dylan a submachine gun and telling him to wait in the safehouse. Dylan incredulously asks if Eddie is abandoning him, but Eddie replies that he has a duty to protect the innocent. Shutting the safehouse door, Eddie rips the controls out and sets out into the night, noting that in lying to Dylan he might have more parental instincts than he thought.\nEddie comes across a troll and some dark elves torturing captured civilians, noting that the dreamstone-symbiote is filling him with a familiar overwhelming bloodlust but that it's somehow different from the Venom symbiote's ravenous corrupted state. Recognizing the dark elves as the same ones who'd wounded him, Eddie snarls that he's back for revenge and rips them apart, taking one of their swords for himself. As he fights, Eddie realizes that the dreamstone-symbiote lacks a voice and that the rage and hatred that he feels are his own dialed up to eleven. The troll eagerly attacks, wondering what Eddie's blood tastes like, but is decapitated mid-leap by a tendril. Grabbing the troll's battle-axe, Eddie lets out a victorious roar; inwardly admitting that he's scared by the fact that what he's feeling isn't the predatory urges of his symbiote but his own dark emotions; that the dreamstone-symbiote is a physical manifestation of his own hatred, rage, and bloodlust. When a frightened civilian asks who he is, Eddie states that he isVenom- chastising himself for initially using his customary \"we\" before changing to \"I.\"\nElsewhere, the maimed war witch teleports into a dark apartment, lamenting that she should have anticipated that Venom would have betrayed her and that she cannot return to her sisters so humiliated - especially after they warned her. A voice interrupts, sarcastically commenting on her sob story before asking what she's doing in his apartment. The war witch states she can offer the speaker a gift, but the tenant sneers that he doesn't accept gifts from creepy old women with eyes in their hair. The war witch smirks and says that his world is coming to an end, and that Venom needs to either be turned into a force for chaos and evil or killed. Conjuring another dreamstone, the witch states she knows that the tenant has a dark history with Venom and desires revenge, offering the power to seek it if he agrees to serve her. Eagerly accepting her offer,Jack O'Lanternsteps out of the shadows and reaches for the dreamstone crystal.\nWAR OF THE REALMS TIE-IN!\n• The Marvel Comics event of the year makes landfall in the world of the wicked web-slinger as Venom gets swept up in Malekith’s campaign to take over the Ten Realms!"

Loki's advice to the Allfather is to go to Midgard and \"assert your authority in person.\"  This idea appeals to him, so he instills a little of the Odin Power into Loki, leaves him in charge of Asgard, and leaves for Earth.\nOn Earth, Dr. Blake sends his nurse Jane Foster home, to rest, because she is very tired after the encounter with the Enchantress and Executioner[1].  After she leaves, Blake notices that is too quiet, and does a quick patrol of the city, for any more \"telltale signs of danger.\"\nIn Asgard, Loki is relishing in his new power and vowing that he will never give up Odin's throne.  In an effort to keep Odin from returning to Asgard, he uses his new power to free Odin's two most fearsome enemies (\"they shall defeat Odin for me!\"),Skagg (Storm Giant), andSurtur the Fire Demon.  The loyal Heimdall hears the incantations, but since he cannot and will not leave his post, guarding the Rainbow Bridge, he sends forBalderthe Brave, to go to Earth and alert Odin.\nBalder quickly reaches Earth and finds Thor, giving him the message about Odin.  Thor realizes that the only reason for his visit is to see his mortal, alter-ego of Dr. Don Blake.  Thor enters Blake's office through the window and alerts his father to the danger that Loki has set loose.  \"Then, at a gesture from the monarch of Asgard's hand, the very fabric oftimeitself stands still, as the entire human race, under an irresistible spell is instantly transported to a dimension beyond the ken of the human mind!\"\nAt the next moment, the foes that Loki summoned appear on Earth.  Balder the Brave is the first to charge forth on his winged steed at the Storm Giant, and makes quick work of the ten-ton club with his Asgardian sword.  Just as Thor is about to help, a firebolt strikes his hammer, throwing him off balance, and out of the fight for a moment.  Odin steps in, saying, \"no longer can I remain merely a witness . . . \", and causes the seabed beneath the Storm Giant's feet to soften, and Skagg starts to sink, calling on Surtur for help.\nOnce Skagg is saved from sinking, Surtur moves to destroy the deserted Earth by melting the polar ice caps, while Skagg creates a storm to distract the heroes.  Thor begins the battle with Skagg while Odin, on his winged Battle Steed, places a protective barrier over the deserted city.  Thor's attack weakens and stuns the Storm Giant, allowing Odin to use the magic of his \"Shining Sword\" to drain the evil power from him.  Even though Loki tries to support Skagg from Asgard by replenishing his power, Odin is finally defeats him.\nThis effort weakens the Wise One, leaving Thor and Balder to take care of Surtur.  Thor realizes that they \"cannot reach him in time, [and] there areotherways to stop him!!\"   Since Surtur is an older immortal than Thor, and his hammerMjolnir\"might not prevail\", he takes his father's magic sword, since \"it is older than all\" and \"only hissoncan wield it!\"  Using theOdin-Force, he draws Surtur away from the ice caps and Earth itself, toward a special asteroid made of \"magnetic particles!\"  This holds Surtur in a magnetic pull \"which will last for ages to come!\"\nWith the threats to Earth neutralized, Odin leaves for Asgard once again, bidding Balder and Thor to join him for a well deserved rest.  Thor declines, saying that Earth is his home now, and he shall remain there always.  Once back in Asgard, Odin punishes the tricky Loki, sending him to \"serve the trolls\" until Odin sets him free.  Odin muses over a foreboding of the future, that his son is the most worthy and brave in the universe, yet \"his heart weakened by love!\"\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nThis is the story of how Heimdall came to be the guardian ofBifrostthe rainbow bridge.Odinholds a sort of try-out, summoning Heimdall and two other worthy candidates.  Agnar the Fierce is the first, and offers himself as having the mightiest chest, the strongest lungs, and that none but he has the power to sound the horn warning,Gjallahorn. As he demonstrates this ability, the \"roar reaches to infinity.\"  The second is Gotron the Agile, who claims that his deeds speak for themselves, and that he wass nimble enough to defeat seven frost giants at once, when they attacked Asgard \"only last year.\"\nThe last isHeimdallThe Faithful, who shows that he has useful abilities other than strength \"that is a match for any.\"  He proves this by stepping out into Odin's garden and, by placing his ear on the grass, hears the tiniest plant growing in the heart of a place known as the \"Hidden Hills,\" which was scorched by the fiery breath of a dragon.  After Odin dispatches his gardener to verify the tiny new plant just blossoming into life, Heimdall proves himself further.  He says that his eyesight is so keen that he \"can see acrosstimeas well as space!!\"  He then informs Odin of a \"savage band of Storm Giants\" marching towards the rainbow bridge, still two days away.  Odin then dispatches a heavily-armed war party to meet the Storm Giants.  The war party returns in days, with the King of the Storm Giants as prisoner.  These demonstrations of abilities and noble character earn Heimdall the position of \"Guardian of the Rainbow Bridge - -FOREVER!\""

A Frost Giant slams his fist on Venom, gloating that he crushed the symbiote like a bug, but the symbiote flows up his arm and impales his head with a bladed tendril. As the last of the Frost Giants are slain, Danvers clears Winter Soldier and Black Widow for takeoff.\nLater, in Stockholm, Sweden, the War Avengers – equipped with Stane mech suits - engage a horde of dark elves, Deadpool quipping that Black Widow should show the world she’s back from the dead ‘’and’’ get her own movie fast-tracked by uploading a selfie of herself fighting elves in a mech suit. The War Avengers are overwhelmed as thousands of dark elves arrive, the team regrouping as they are surrounded. As Deadpool complains that this mission was a failure, Captain Marvel says that it was a success – their goal was to assess the strength ofMalekith’s horde. As Deadpool quips that they’ll have all the cookies and rice puff cereal they can eat, Danvers signalsCaptain Britainfor an evacuation. A portal opens behind them, and Captain Britain pokes his head out, asking if she called him. The War Avengers step through to find themselves at Braddock Academy – Deadpool dumbstruck, having just made a ‘’Harry Potter’’ reference. Turning to Captain Marvel, he asks why the team spent so much time in the Quinjet if she had a magic portal, and Danvers retorts that this rescue was a one-time deal as Captain Britain owed her a favor. Captain Britain offers his services to the team but refuses to drag his students into the War of the Realms, but Deadpool remarks that he’s fed up with being on the defensive. Danvers sadly agrees but says they lack the manpower to take out ‘’one’’ of Malekith’s armies, let alone all of them. As she laments that they can’t just take the fight to Malekith himself, Captain Britain interrupts and says that theBlack Knight,Union Jack, andSpitfirehave been fighting Malekith in London. Captain Marvel immediately calls for a surgical strike to decapitate Malekith’s army and end the War of the Realms once and for all.\nIn a pub in London, Spitfire complains as she gets Dark Elf blood in her mouth, the Black Knight and Union Jack finishing off the last of a group of elven soldiers; the latter helping himself to a pint of ale. The Black Knight says that Captain Britain sent a memo that the Avengers are en-route, but their conversation is interrupted as a moss-mammoth smashes through the front of the pub. Malekith andKurseenter, Union Jack holding up a finger for them to let him finish his drink as the Black Knight and Spitfire prepare to battle.\nOn the Quinjet, Captain Marvel delivers a rousing speech to the War Avengers, saying that Malekith did what previous supervillains had tried and failed to do – conquering the Earth – but that he came for Earth last because of the superheroes guarding it, and that it’s their job to put him in the ground and remind his army of monsters that “Earth’s Mightiest Heroes” aren’t to be messed with.\nIn London, Malekith claims theEbony Bladefor himself, gushing about its blood curse. Before he can kill the Black Knight, the War Avengers arrive and attack, Malekith annoyed at his triumphant monologue being interrupted. Kurse intercepts Captain Marvel, and Malekith nonchalantly dodges Weapon H and Winter Soldier. Venom impales a group of dark elves on spikes, declaring his intent to eat Malekith and punching the warlord through a bus. Getting up, Malekith remarks that he’s read the symbiote’s mind and learned aboutKnullandAll-Black the Necrosword. Before Captain Marvel can stop him, Venom lunges jaws-first at Malekith and is impaled on the Ebony Blade. Captain Marvel is thrown back by the ensuing explosion, and as the smoke clears she sees that Malekith and Venom are gone, leaving the Ebony Blade at the bottom of a crater.\nAfter the War Avengers return to Avengers Mountain, Captain Marvel furiously overturns Weapon H's tabletop game. Slumping to the ground, Captain Marvel laments that she's used to being the most powerful woman in the room, a superhero, but that she's a soldier in-name-only. Lamenting that war is at its most basic a cruel game played for various reasons, Danvers states that sometimes they are the players - the generals calling the shots - but more often than not they're nothing but pieces on the board - soldiers risking everything on the front-lines. Chastising her hubris at having thought her team could win the war on her own, Captain Marvel nevertheless vows that the War Avengers will fight until their last breath.\nCAPTAIN MARVEL AND HER WAR AVENGERS HOLD THE FRONTLINE!"

The fight continues on between Thor and Ulik who admits during the fight that they only wished to remove Thor's hammer from his person and that to a warrior all weapons are fair during battle.

The encounter has Jane completely in awe. Odin, in honour of Thor and Jane's impending marriage, uses his powers to transform Jane into a god just like they are. As well as being imbued with immortality, Jane also learns that she can fly, however she lacks the necessary skill to stay aloft and Thor must come to her rescue.\nAs a final test of her worth, Jane is locked in a room to face the Unknown to see if she has the courage to be among the gods. However, Jane is horrified by the creature and cowers away from it in utter fear, forcing Thor to come to her rescue and fight the monster off. Finding everything too much, Jane demands to be changed back to normal and return to her normal life with no memory of Asgard. Odin complies with her wish, in spite of Thor's protests, and Jane is shunted back to Earth.\nWhen Thor continues to protest Odin's decision, the All-Father exerts his will upon his son who ultimately accepts Jane's fate.

When Thor inquires about what's wrong, Odin has his Grand Vizier activate the Coals of the Cosmos to show him the World Beyond, and how it is growing rapidly, consuming the known universe as it grows. Odin explains that he sent the Warriors Three into the World Beyond and they failed to stop it. Odin also shows Thor that some of their old foes: Galactus, Mangog, and Loki are not responsible for this cataclysmic event either. To make matter worse, whatever is causing the event is also causing the Odinsword to slowly pull out of it's scabbard.\nFinally, Odin explains that his mind is plagued by one word, the name of the being which rules the World Beyond: Infinity. When Thor notices a stranger in the chamber, Odin identifies him as \"The Silent One\" and that the Silent One has been allowed audience before Odin due to the fact that Odin believes that the Silent One holds the key to defeating Infinity. Thor attempts to get answers by force, but finds that he is unable to harm the Silent One.\nFinally, Odin decides that he will venture into the World Beyond to seek answers. When Thor tries to convince Odin to let him go in his stead, Odin declines ordering Thor to remain in Asgard and protect the realm from anyone who might capitalize on Odin's absence.

It's an image of Odin in the World Beyond, and he has confronted Infinity, but it turns out that Infinity is too strong for Odin to battle. Before the outcome of the battle can be revealed the image disappears.\nFearing for his fathers fate, Thor realizes that he has no other choice but to venture into the World Beyond."

Checking to be sure, the Wrecker finds no sign of life in Thor and gloats over how easily he defeated his foe and leaves him. Thor's body is then visited by Hela who has come to claim his soul. However before she can give Thor her killing touch, his still living body projects an astral image that stops her hand.\nMeanwhile back in the Realm of Asgard, in the home of Karnilla the Norn Queen, Loki hides out with the mystic crystal that would allow Odin to see that Thor is dying on Earth and has come to the Norn Queen's side to get the aid of her people. Witnessing Balder and Sif's approach through the crystal, Loki sends one of Karnilla's giant barbarians to attack the approaching Gods. Although the giants' attack catches Balder off guard, the brave warrior is able to regain his footing and counter attack, easily defeating the barbarian. With the battle over, Balder is shocked to find that Sif has disappeared at some point during the fight.\nBack on Earth, Thor's astral projection tells Hela that he refuses to give in to death because the Earth is still being plagued by the Wrecker, and as long as that threat exists, he cannot accept death. Witnessing the Wrecker fighting off a bunch of police officers, Thor foolishly tries to stop the Wrecker but his immaterial form is unable to even touch his foe, who is oblivious that his foe is still trying to thwart him.\nWhile back in Asgard, Balder continues his quest to Karnilla's castle, when he is attacked and taken out by barbarians who knock him out with sleeping herbs. In that same castle, Sif (who had been taken prisoner by Karnilla) has been forced to watch Balder's defeat, and in a cruel jest Karnilla shows Sif the fate of Thor. Taking advantage of Sif's belief that Thor is still alive, Karnilla offers her \"aid\" by bringing forth the Destroyer armor and allowing Sif to put her soul into the device to give it life. After doing so, Karnilla transports the Destroyer armor to Earth once more. This plays into both Karnilla and Loki's hand as they know that the Destroyer's predisposition to destroy any Gods would force Sif to attack her lover once the threat of the Wrecker had been dealt with.\nOn Earth, Thor decides to once more join his mortal body and finds that he has regained some of his strength and revives. He comes around just in time to see the arrival of the Destroyer. The Destroyer easily destroys the Wrecker's crowbar and blasts the foe into unconsciousness before it begins to turn it's attention to Thor. Unaware who's soul is trapped in the armor, Thor rushes towards the mystic armor ready to destroy it if need be.\nThis story is continued next issue...\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nThe aquatic Inhuman Triton has grown restless, and decides to leave the hidden city of Attilan. Several days of swimming bring him to a tropical island, where he sees a strange creature attacking a human female. He rushes to her rescue only to interrupt a monster movie being filmed there. Believing that the diving cameramen are hie enemies, Triton attacks.  He is shot with a tranquilizer gun and taken prisoner. Held in a glass water tank as they sail to New York, Triton wonders what will happen when the world learns of his power."

His physical form may be confined there, but by means of thought projection his disembodied self travels toEarthin search of revenge. He spots Thor in his human identity of Dr.Donald Blakebut resists defeating him as it would be a hollow victory compared to defeating him as Thor.\nAfter hours of searching, Loki happens across theHulkand devises a wicked plan to entice Blake to transform into Thor. He projects a mental image of dynamite on the tracks of a nearby railway bridge. The Hulk spots the dynamite and attempts to snuff it out, accidentally destroying the bridge. Suddenly, a train appears on the tracks traveling towards the wreckage. Valiantly, the Hulk manages to hold the tracks up long enough for the train to pass safely before allowing it to collapse. Unfortunately, the damage has already been done and Loki's plan was successful.\nHours later, newspapers print articles about the Hulk being on the rampage again and a manhunt begins. The Hulk's friend,Rick Jones, reads the article with disbelief and meets with members of theTeen Brigadein order to find help to track Hulk down to find the truth. They attempt to contact theFantastic Fourbut Loki interferes with the radio signal, diverting it to Don Blake. He decides to transform into Thor to help the Teen Brigade. Unknown to Loki, the radio signal is also picked up byAnt-Man, theWasp, andIron Man, who also travel to assist.\nLater, the Teen Brigade are disappointed that the Fantastic Four hadn't responded to their message when they finally get a reply. They inform the Teen Brigade that they are too busy with another case but they have a hunch that other heroes may have received their distress call. Suddenly Thor, Iron Man, Ant-Man, and the Wasp arrive. Loki realizes that the other heroes will only interfere with his plans and lures Thor away by creating a mental image of the Hulk. Upon catching up with this fake \"Hulk\", Thor attacks and realizes it isn't real, and immediately suspects Loki. He then returns to Asgard to face his brother.\nMeanwhile, Iron Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp track down the Hulk with the help ofAnt-Man's ants. He is working at a circus pretending to be a robot called Mechano. They attempt to capture him by causing the ground below him to cave in, by dropping a steel cylinder onto him, and trying to catch him in a net. Hulk manages to escape the circus. Iron Man gives chase but the Hulk cripples his battery, and escapes while Iron Man repairs it.\nBack in Asgard, Thor asks permission fromOdinto meet Loki on the Isle of Silence to question him. Odin accepts but warns that he cannot interfere between the two brothers' quarrel. As Thor sets out across the Sea of Mist he is attacked by Loki's traps. First, he narrowly escapes tangle roots that threaten to drag him down into the depths. Next, a volcano erupts releasing volcanic gas globules capable of sapping the strength of any god. Thor manages to evade these by diving into the sea. On the island, Loki spots Thor's empty boat and wonders with disbelief if Thor has already been defeated. Suddenly, a giant water spout appears in front of him as Thor emerges from the sea to face him. He throws his hammer at Loki, only to have it deflected by a hastily-made ice shield.\nLoki calls upon aRock Troll, which begins to drag Thor beneath the ground. At the last moment, Thor uses his hammer to summon lightning which dazzles the troll, causing it to relinquish his hold. Thor angrily swings his hammer at Loki, who has created multiple mental images of himself to confuse him. Thor counters this by spinning his hammer fast enough to blow all the figures away, revealing the true Loki. Soaking up the magnetic flow from the earth with his hammer, he captures Loki via magnetic attraction and takes him back to Earth to clear the Hulk's name.\nOn Earth, Iron Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp continue to pursue the Hulk to an auto factory inDetroit. Thor appears with Loki to clear Hulk's name. Suddenly Loki makes himself radioactive forcing the heroes to retreat. Luckily, Loki stands over a trapdoor and Ant-Man's ants trigger a switch, dropping him into a lead-lined tank. Upon celebrating their victory, Ant-Man and the Wasp point out how well they could work as a team, and that they should work together in the future. The Wasp suggests they should call themselves theAvengers, and everybody agrees.\nAnd there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes found themselves united against a common threat! On that day, the Avengers were born, to fight the foes no single super hero could withstand!"

With no time to change into Spider-Man, Peter kicks off his shoes and leaps into action. He easily incapacitates the muggers and is surprised to see that the woman involved is trying to flee the scene. When Peter tries to stop her, she tells him that she doesn't want to get involved. Peter is frustrated but allows the woman to leave. This entire exchange is observed by Thor who tries to encourage the youth not to get too upset. Peter is glib with the thunder god, testing his patience. Suddenly, the sky begins to change, inverting to a negative color. Quick thinking, Thor begins swinging Mjolnir creating a protective vortex around the pair. When the vortex dissipates, Thor and Peter are the only two unaffected in a now inverted world.\nWhile Thor takes in the scene and questions what mystical force was responsible, Peter changes into Spider-Man. Just as Spider-Man finishes changing into costume, they spot a group of strange armored soldiers walking about the city. Thor finds them familiar and identifies them as foes, leading Spider-Man into battle. As they battle the warriors, Thor recognizes their leader as the troll known as Kryllk. As the two heroes battle Kryllk's army, the troll explains that what he has done to Earth is merely the staging grounds for an attack on Asgard. The heroes are restrained, and Kryllk shows off his means of accomplishing this goal, the Dark Crystal. When Thor and Spider-Man tries to strike back, Kryllk and his minions suddenly teleport away. Spider-Man asks Thor who their foe is, and the thunder god explains that Kryllk attempted to conquer Asgard centuries ago, only to be stopped by his father Odin.\nTheir next move takes them to Avenger's Mansion, where the team is also frozen like everyone else in the city. They quickly use the Avenger's computers to track the energies of the Dark Crystal to Asgard. Since he has been exiled from his home, Thor sends Spider-Man to stop the crystal, while he goes to Kryllk's hideout. Traveling through a vortex created by Thor, Spider-Man quickly arrives in Asgard. He discovers that it is in the same situation as Earth. Meanwhile, Thor arrives on a planetoid near Jupiter where Kryllk has set up operations. Feeling vibrations emanating from beneath his feet, Thor uses Mjolnir to smash down below. There he finds Kryllk and his army standing guard before the Dark Crystal. The thunder god fights through the soldiers, but when Thor tries to attack Kryllk himself, but the villain is protected by the aura of the crystal. Kryllk explains that he found the Dark Crystal deep below Asgard and that it told him the secrets of the universe, secrets that Kryllk intended to use against his hated enemy Odin.\nWhile back on Asgard, Spider-Man has also found a Dark Crystal, as well as more of Kryllk's minions and Kryllk himself. Spider-Man begins fighting his the soldiers, and takes note that Kryllk is not even paying attention to him, as though he has having a conversation with someone. When Spider-Man tries to strike Kryllk his fist passes right through his foe. Although it has no apparent effect on Kryllk in Asgard, his physical form near Jupiter suddenly screams in pain and vanishes. Suddenly, the Watcher appears with Spider-Man, and explains that the Dark Crystal belonged to him and that Kryllk had stolen it to tamper with the time continuum in an attempt to destroy Asgard. With the threat now over, the Watcher teleports Spider-Man and Thor back to Earth. Returning to his observatory on the moon, the Watcher ponders how fate allowed Spider-Man and Thor to combat this threat."

Thor tells them that he is unfit, and believes that Odin is lost is some other realm waiting for Thor to find him.  Back on Earth, Mr Ryan is riding along with Christine and Jake to find out why Jake keeps disappearing all the time.  They respond to a fire call, and one of the firemen is trapped inside.  Jake goes in to try and help him, but becomes trapped and can't change into Thor anymore.  In the Kingdom of the Trolls, there is a feud going on between two Rock Trolls, when Thor intervenes, demanding to speak to Geirrodur.  Ulik stands in his way, and when he begins to speak ill of Odin, Thor demolishes him with ease.  The other Trolls notice how quickly Thor defeated him, noting the he's more powerful than ever before.  Geirrodur arrives, and Thor tells him he wants to speak to Orikal.  Geirrodur grants his request since he has lost his father, and Thor asks Orikal if there is any trace of his father anywhere.  Orikal scans all plains of existence and finds no trace of Odin.  Thor leaves with a warning from Orikal, to return to Earth quickly since a mortal close to him is close to death.  After he leaves, Geirrodur asks Orikal about the future since Odin's death, and Orikal says that it will be worse than they can possibly believe.  Thor returns to Earth in time to save Jake, and tells Christine to take care of the injured fireman, and that he will see to Jake.  Thor flies him to a nearby rooftop, where Jake is fine, and they talk.  They both find it strange, and yet enjoyable, almost like having a brother.  Thor tells Jake that he is unfit for the throne, and Jake tells him that he wasn't testing him so much as preparing him, and that he passed every test Odin put him to.  He is more fit than anyone else to take the throne.  Thor decides that Jake is right, and tells Jake that he's going to take him to a wedding.  On some unnamed planet, the Dark Gods are on the run from Desak, their numbers down to just a few, and Perrikus deciding that they must stand their ground.  Meanwhile, back in Asgard, Thor and Jake arrive, and Thor announces that with the people's blessing and forgiveness for his recent actions, he will take the throne.  And his first act as monarch, is to perform a wedding ceremony."

Heimdall says that as he respectfully reminded Odin himself, he is not nor has he ever been omniscient, and his sworn duty is to espy threats against Asgardia. Thus, the new Thor doesn't strike his eyes as a threat. That doesn't sit well with Odinson, who wants to know Thor's identity, suspecting that it's someone he knows. After reminding Odinson that he should focus on his own worthiness than Thor's, he starts describing the various threats taking shape across the realms.\nOdinson decides to go to Midgard to stop the trolls hiding there. As he fights his foes, he has a one-sided conversation, theorizing that Thor must be Valkyrie, Sif or Angela. He later returns to the Moon, reasoning that due to the lack of atmosphere, only an Asgardian could walk on the Moon. However, he reminds himself that Mjolnir landed in the Blue Area of the Moon, the only habitable area. He wishes aloud that Uatu the Watcher was still alive and curses Nick Fury for his \"damned whisper\". Suddenly, he is interrupted by Volstagg, urging him to return to Asgardia, because Jane Foster collapsed earlier in the day, due to her fight with breast cancer, and refuses any magical Asgardian treatments. After a talk with his ex-lover, Odinson crosses Foster off the list of potential suspects as Thor.\nHe then visits Agent Phil Coulson on the Helicarrier for the whereabouts of his next suspect: Agent Roz Solomon. Coulson says that Solomon was on leave after the incident with the trolls in Broxton. He then tries to call her at Odinson's insistence. It is revealed that Solomon's flying car is hovering above Roxxon Island, where Agger and Malekith are finalizing their deal. Suddenly, Roxxon security alerts them that they've detected an intruder on the roof. And that intruder is Thor.\nMeanwhile, Freyja confronts Odin for handing control of the Destroyer to his brother Cul. Odin retorts that Cul serves him and shows better fealty than his own wife, prompting her to slap him. Odin tells her she shouldn't have done that. He vows that the hammer will be returned to Asgard. Freyja warns him to be careful of what he wishes for, for the hammer will surprise him.\nBack on Earth, Thor calls out to Agger, accusing him of conspiring with Malekith, only to be interrupted by the explosive entrance of the Destroyer.\nWHO IS THOR?\n• That’s the question on everyone’s lips. Most especially Prince Odinson of Asgard. This issue, he starts to narrow down the list of suspects."

All over the world, heroes keep their efforts to defend the Earth:Tony Stark,ShuriandScrewbeardwork on weapons at theAvengers Mountain, which is about to become attacked by enemies;Roz SolomonlocatesRoxxon's base inAntarctica;Namorfights off Fire Sharks underwater; theDora MilajedefendWakandafromAngelsofHeven; inManhattan, theFantastic Fourare holding at bay Malekith's forces on their own.\nMalekith uses the Ebony Blade on War Avengers memberVenom, teleporting himself and it away from battle. The Dark Elves attacking Asgard manage to blow up the Bifrost, cutting off travel between the realms for the heroes. Freyja's team is cornered at the Black Biforst, and after sensing the Biforst's destruction, the All-Mother decides to instead make use of it. Captain America's team reaches Thor, but they find him consumed by warrior's madness.\nAtAvengers Mountain,All-Mother FreyjaandCaptain Americago over a plan to destroy theBlack Bifrostand retakeMidgardfromMalekith and his allies. Giving Captain AmericaJarnbjorn, Freyja tasks him with going toJotunheimand rescuingThor- a mission that Steve Rogers accepts.\nInAsgard,HeimdallandMatt Murdockstand inHiminbjörgat the foot of the shatteredBifrost. Heimdall tells Daredevil that he would often watch his exploits in the \"Kitchen of Hel\" - which Daredevil remarks is more than a little creepy, asking how they're going to go about fixing the Bifrost. Heimdall, whose eyes were stolen, tells Daredevil to take up his swordHofund, which will imbue him with its divine power and turn him into the next Guardian of the Bifrost, though he warns him that being imbued with the power of a god of omniscience may be more than Daredevil's mortal mind can handle. Remarking he never was a good Catholic, Daredevil draws Hofund and is transformed into a god, the Bifrost reforming. Heimdall asks Daredevil if he is alright, and the new God Without Fear replies that he can hear everything from stars going supernova to butterflies taking flight. Entering Himinbjörg accompanied by theDestroyer, All-MotherJane Fostertells Daredevil that Malekith will sense that the Bifrost is working again and that they need to act quickly to send the three strikeforces where they need to go and get ready to hold the Rainbow Bridge.\nCaptain America,Spider-Man,Wolverine,Luke Cage, andIron Fist- equipped with Asgardian weapons and armor, and astride winged horses - enter Jotunheim through a Bifrost portal. Spider-Man complains about only getting a shield before realizing he's insulting Captain America, who ignores him and asks if Wolverine can locate Thor's scent. Wolverine indicates a river of Frost Giant blood flowing below them, suggesting they follow it. Luke Cage wonders why they're using flying horses when snowmobiles would be more efficient, Iron Fist asking if he's never seen any \"sword and sandal\" movies. They're interrupted by an arrow the size of a telephone pole, which impales Luke Cage's winged horse. Spotting a pair of Frost Giant archers, Captain America tells his taskforce to take evasive action, Spider-Man offering to deflect the arrows with his shield. Wolverine sarcastically wonders how he was the one who died when Spider-Man is so stupid. As Captain America tells them to kill the Archers in the name of Thor, Luke Cage angrily removes the arrow from his horse and throws it like a javelin.\nFreyja,Punisher,Blade(impersonating Dark Elves),Hulk(impersonating a rock troll), andGhost Rider(impersonating a fire giant) try to sneak past a checkpoint inSvartalfheim. As Freyja tries to persuade the two guards to let them pass, they ask the Punisher what clan he belongs to. The Punisher - making a note in his mental War Journal to never leave the Five Boroughs again - angrily replies that his clan is dead, just like they're going to be. Blade berates Castle for breaking character as the strikeforce casts off their disguises, noting that if he squints hard enough the Dark Elves look enough like vampires for him to enjoy killing them. Freyja orders Ghost Rider to summon theHell Charger- the strikeforce climbing aboard and breaking through the checkpoint.\nInLondon, Malekith defeats theBlack Knightand takes theEbony Blade; marveling at the cursed sword's bloodlust and declaring it a fitting weapon for the ruler of New Svartalfheim - formerly known as Europe.Captain Marvelarrives with her strikeforce, theWar Avengers-Captain Britain,Deadpool,Lady Sif,Venom,Weapon H,Winter Soldier. As Captain Marvel engagesKurse, Malekith teleports out of the way and mocks them. Venom lunges at Malekith, declaring his intent to eat him.\nIn Himinbjörg, Daredevil informs Jane Foster that Midgard is slipping away. Jane Foster declares that she won't let that happen, asking Daredevil what the status of their away teams are. Daredevil remarks that all three teams are hopelessly outnumbered and fighting for their lives, adding that will soon be the case for them as well: Dark Elves are on the way. Immediately after he finishes speaking, a Black Bifrost portal opens and a group of Dark Elf suicide bombers charge through - armed with enough swamp bombs to blast Asgard to smithereens. Jane, the Destroyer, Heimdall, and Daredevil engage the elves to hold the bridge - the latter's omniscience letting him see the ongoing events of the war:ShuriandTony Starkworking withScrewbeardto build a new weapon to turn the tide of battle, even as hordes of Frost Giants, Fire Goblins, and Dark Elves approach the body of theProgenitor;Roz Solomonddogfighting a fleet ofRoxxonparamilitary helicopters while reporting toher bossthat the corporation has seized Antarctica; andKing Namorfighting a swarm ofMuspelheim Firesharksto defendAtlantis. Daredevil sees thatSindris razingAsia, theEnchantresshas conqueredSouth Americaand is raising an army ofthe dead,Ulikhas conqueredAustralia, andHeven's angels are fighting theDora Milajefor control ofAfrica; while inManhattantheFantastic Fourhave arrived to help take back the city.\nIn Jotunheim, Captain America cuts open a Frost Giant to save Spider-Man, who complains that they're somehow even colder on the inside. With the last of their winged horses having frozen to death, they're forced to continue the search on foot. Standing atop a dead Frost Giant, Wolverine remarks they're close, telling the others to listen. Iron Fist remarks that he can hear someone screaming, Wolverine saying that's Thor and Captain America telling the team to pick up the pace.\nIn Svartalfheim, Freyja's strikeforce arrives at the Black Bifrost and cut down the guards. As Blade wonders how they'll destroy it, the Punisher suggests rigging the Hell Charger into a car bomb, to Ghost Rider's displeasure. Saying they have all the destructive force they need, Freyja turns to Jennifer Walters, who starts charging gamma energy to destroy the Black Bifrost in one punch.\nIn London, Venom mocks Malekith and throws him through a bus. Malekith remarks that he wasn't aware they'd been fighting, having read the symbiote's mind and learned ofKnullandAll-Black. Wreathing the Ebony Blade in flames, Malekith impales Venom, seemingly incinerating him. Not noticing the Ebony Blade embedded in the street, Captain Marvel orders her team to regroup and find Malekith, then wonders where Venom went.\nIn Himinbjörg, Daredevil is overloaded by his All-Sight, enabling one of the Dark Elf suicide bombers to get by and blow up the Bifrost. In Svartalfheim, Freyja senses the Bifrost's destruction and tells the team their plans have shifted from destroying the Black Bifrost to holding it. As Dark Elf tanks made from giant crocodilian monsters approach, Jennifer decides to unleash her charged-up gamma energy on them.\nIn Jotunheim, Captain America's team comes across pair of piles of Frost Giant corpses so high they could be mistaken for mountains. Spider-Man spots Thor, but Wolverine pulls him back and warns the team that Thor is in the grip of something he's all-too familiar with: the berserker rage. Soaked with Frost Giant blood and wreathed in lightning, his hammer almost completely destroyed and his prosthetic arm missing, Thor lets out a scream of bloodlust and demands that every Frost Giant in the realm come to him.\nRECLAIM THE REALMS!"

As Thor is forced to battle his own father, Infinity continues to consume the entire universe, one planet at a time, causing intergalactic upheaval.\nOn the planet Earth, total environmental chaos has happened causing the entire populace to panic and war to erupt all over the globe. While in distant Asgard, the Great Vizier tries all methods available to keep the Odinsword from exiting it's scabbard. With but faint hopes everywhere, Balder and Sif decide to travel to the land of the Norns to seek the aid of Karnilla to see if her mystical might can help their cause. After being ambushed by some Trolls, they are rescued by Karnilla, who agrees to help out because it would put Balder in her debt.\nWhen they arrive in Asgard, they have Karnilla attempt to break Infinity's spell on the Warriors Three, however she fails to do so alone. When Loki is spotted, Sif appeals to his sense of self preservation to combine his magical power with Karnilla's and the two mystics manage to free the Warriors Three from Infinity's mind control. With the Warriors Three free, Fandral regretfully informs Sif that Thor had died at the hands of Hela, unaware that Thor managed to escape this fate.\nThor soon arrives and everyone but Loki is happy to see that the Thunder God is still alive. Needing to know the secret of Infinity, Thor locks himself in Odin's chamber with the Great Vizier to try and unravel this mystery, ordering Sif, Balder and the Warriors Three to guard the door. However, instead of approaching it with the mind of a god, he will approach the problem with the mind of a mortal, and changes back into the form of Donald Blake. Blake has the Vizier show him all the information about the time that Odin was in the Odinsleep at in the Sea of Eternal Sleep.\nOutside, Loki is furious that someone is in the imperial chamber unattended and forces his way inside. As Loki struggles with the others, Thor (back in his godly form) exits the room and explains to everyone, to his horror, has learned the secret identity of Infinity, Thor explains now that he knows the secret of Infinity, he knows that he must succeed."

Asked by Honeyshot what the plan is, Spider-Man responds that they'll use Ro's stealth spell to infiltrateLagosand rescue the civilians being held hostage, but beyond that it's a work-in-progress, causing Screwbeard to wonder whyThorput Spider-Man in charge.\nIn a flashback, Spider-Man wonders why Thor wants him to lead the League of Realms, Thor responding that given that the War of the Realms is occurring on Midgard the inter-realm team of warriors needs an inhabitant of Midgard to lead them, and that Spider-Man is the best choice. Spider-Man protests that while he can hold his own in a fight he's not a warrior, Thor responding that his aversion to killing makes him the perfect choice.\nIn the present, Spider-Man splits the team into groups of two, to the annoyance of Ud and Screwbeard - who are in favor of charging in and slaughtering the Angels. Spider-Man vetoes this, saying that their priorities are saving civilians and finding the commander of the Angels,Fernande.\nIn a church, Fernande sits on the alter and holds her face, remembering protestingHeven's involvement in the War of the Realms and volunteering to lead Heven's army in place of her comrade,Anemone, lamenting that it's not fair. Her melancholic brooding is interrupted when an Angel soldier bursts into the church and informs her of the League of Realms' arrival. Fernande instructs the soldier to have her troops pretend that nothing is amiss, then attack the intruders and tear out their hearts as soon as they let their guard down.\nIn Lagos, Spider-Man and Ro note that something is amiss, realizing that the latter's stealth spell was counteracted by dark elf magic. As the Angels attack, Spider-Man floors the jeep's gas - the League of Realms leaping into battle and ignoring his protests. As Spider-Man stands back-to-back with Honeyshot and fires a barrage of impact webbing, the light elf notes that Spider-Man isn't killing any of the Angels. When Spider-Man says he's trying not to, Screwbeard furiously holds him at gunpoint and accuses him of being a traitor and double-agent. Spider-Man protests that he just doesn't kill people; Screwbeard demanding to know what he's even doing there, and Ud slamming him to the ground and telling him to stay out of their way. Screwbeard blindly fires a volley of grenades, ignoring Spider-Man shouting at him to stop as there might be civilians in the surrounding houses; Spider-Man staring in horror as an apartment complex is almost struck by a stray grenade. Furiously snapping that the League of Realms are a bunch of idiots and orderingthemto stay out ofhisway, Spider-Man leaps into action. Smashing through the window, Spider-Man encounters a family who informs him that the Angels took many of them hostage and that Fernande is in a nearby church. Wondering why he didn't think of that, Spider-Man tells the family they need to get out of the battlezone.\nAs bloodstained feathers rain from the sky, Fernande bitterly laments the senseless carnage, wondering how many of her comrades have to die for Malekith's conquest. Spider-Man arrives and greets her, saying that he's here to stop the fighting. Furiously demanding to know how he thinks he can stop the bloodshed, Fernande lunges at Spider-Man and grabs his head, slamming him into the wall; snapping that she was born and bred to be the ultimate soldier in service to theQueen of Heven, conditioned to revel in combat and bloodshed. As Fernande conjures a sword and prepares to impale him, Spider-Man commiserates with her hellish upbringing, his empathy catching her off-guard. Spider-Man asks if she doesn't wish that she could stop fighting, saying that he does all the time; and Fernande bemusedly asks him how, Spider-Man replying that the first step would be to help him up.\nStanding on the top of the church alongside Spider-Man, Fernande orders her troops to stand down, catching both the Angels and the League of Realms off-guard. Ro asks Spider-Man what is going on, Spider-Man responding that he's using diplomacy to win; Ud grumbling that he doesn't like that.\nInNairobi,Malekithinterrogates the Queen of Heven as to why one of her most-loyal soldiers would betray her. The Queen of Heven responds that she will personally hunt Fernande down, discover the reasons for her treachery, and make her suffer for it; but Malekith vetoes this, saying he has other plans for her. When the Queen protests, Malekith shuts her down and says that he is leavingKurseto assist her.\nWAR OF THE REALMS TIE-IN!\n• In order to win the War of the Realms, we need a LEAGUE OF REALMS!\n• Thor once led this team with one representive from each fantastical realm, but the League has a NEW leader and representative of Midgard- SPIDER-MAN!\n• Spider-Man must Frodo-Up and lead this ragtag group of SCREWBEARD THE DWARF, UD THE TROLL, RO BLOODROOT THE WIZARD, SIR IVORY HONEYSHOT THE LIGHT ELF and TITANYA THE MOUNTAIN GIANT!

Thor, Loki, Hermod, and Heimdall carried Balder's corpse while Nanna felt her heart rend in two and died. Since Nanna loved Balder, Frigga wanted them to be buried together. Thor also slit the throat of Balder's horse so that it would be buried with the fallen Asgardian and pushed the vessel Skidbladnir, which carried Balder and Nanna, into the sea. Odin boarded the Skidbladnir and kissed Balder's forehead before Thor destroyed the vessel with lightning, causing it to burn.\nAfterwards, Frigga asked who would bring Balder back from Hel and Thor and Loki both volunteered to go. During the journey to Hel, Thor briefly confronted Loki about killing Hoder, ensuring that they would never know his motive and revealed that he found the mistletoe tree blasted to nothing when he attempted to ask it why it betrayed its oath to not harm Balder. When they entered the Great Hall of Hel, they were greeted by Hela who told them that if every living thing in the Nine Realms wept for Balder, he would be free to go. As Hoder confronted Loki in Hel for being responsible for his death and that of Balder's, the God of Mischief and the God of Thunder left with the latter god insisting that the former left Asgard after helping return Balder.\nThor told the Aesir what must be done, so tears were shed and even when the Aesir shed tears in the grove where Balder died, he still did not return, as Loki did not cry and vowed \"never again a tear.\""

As the battle rages, Thor tosses his hammer at the Destroyer; however, the device grabs it and uses it against its owner. Before the Destroyer can do any more damage, it suddenly drops on the ground lifeless, leaving Thor to look to Asgard for answers about the Destroyer's attack on him.\nWhile in that fabled land, Odin watches over his son and surmises that the soul that existed within the Destroyer was removed from its body rendering it inert. This proves to be true, as in the land of the Norns, Karnilla has restored Sif's soul back to her body in order to get Balder to agree to battle Ulik on her behalf. With Balder's wishes complied with, the brave warrior engages in a battle against the strongest of the Rock Trolls.\nAs Balder's battle against Ulik rages on, Thor is suddenly transported to Asgard from Earth, leaving the New York police to deal with the Destroyer armor. Thor finds himself transported into Karnilla's castle where she begs Thor to help Balder in his fight against Ulik. Thor gladly steps in to battle his hated foe in Balder's stead and the two are locked in a furious battle.\nWhile back on Earth, the police have managed to bring the Destroyer armor to the local precinct where they try and decide what to do with it. Odin arrives shortly after in a mortal guise, and tricks the police into thinking that he is a curator from a local museum come to examine the device. However, when the police get a call advising them that the man from the museum is running late, they rush into the room too late and find that Odin had disappeared with the Destroyer armor.\nBack in Asgard, the battle between Thor and Ulik rages on. Forgotten in the din of battle, Loki watches close by hoping to seize an opportunity to defeat Thor once and for all. Although Ulik fights with savage fury, it's Thor's superior battle prowess that wins the day with Thor knocking Ulik into the Abyss of Shadows where the Thunder God hopes the Rock Troll will never return.\nAs the others celebrate Thor's victory, it's only when Sif embraces Thor that the Thunder God realizes that his hammer has been stolen from his belt. Horrified, Thor recognizes that Loki is the only person not present and accounted for in the battle's aftermath and his arch-nemesis has his most prized weapon.\nThis story is continued next issue...\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nTriton arrives at a pier in New York as two men are reading about him in the paper.

He uses his strength to spin one of the cars, causing an accident, knocking a light post which shoots fire and sparks around Triton.  He tries to hide, but all the doors around him are locked.  Policemen finally arrive and fire on the Inhuman. Sensing water beneath him, Triton tears a hole in the street, and escapes back to the ocean by the sewer.\nMaking his way back to Attilan, the Inhumans' island home, Triton tells their ruler Black Bolt that if they are found by humans they will be destroyed,  so Black Bolt makes the decision that their city must be moved to a safer place."

Until this point, Sif has managed to keep the Destroyer's natural inclination to destroy any God's in it's path in check. But she begins to lose control of the mystic armor's baser instincts as Thor increases the fury of his attacks. The Destroyer pitches into full control just when Thor smashes a car over the armors head, sending it into a full battle fury.\nWatching from her castle is Karnilla and Loki, who have orchestrated these events in the hopes that the Destroyer will kill Thor once and for all. Karnilla calls for the recently captured Balder to be brought before her to witness the destruction of Thor, and also tries to win Balder's affections. Her flirtations are interrupted when Ulik storms the room and throws a sword at them to announce the fact that he intends to kill them all.\nBack on Earth, Thor continues his fight against the Destroyer, while inside the armor, Sif tries desperately to regain control and stop the fight, but finds that her will is not powerful enough to seize control of the rampaging armor. As the battle rages on in the Destroyer's favor, back in Asgard, Odin's trusted wizard manages to create a new mystic crystal for Odin to be able to view the Earth. Witnessing Thor's losing battle against the Destroyer and unaware of the machinations of Loki and Karnilla, Odin restores Thor's full strength and godly might.\nThor realizes his full power has been restored when his hammer suddenly pulls out of the Destroyer's grasp and returns to him. Rejoicing at having his full power back, Thor resumes his fight against the Destroyer with his most powerful blows. At a distinct physical disadvantage, the Destroyer then (much to Sif's horror) activates it's disintegratior and fires a beam toward Thor.\nBack in the land of the Norns, Ulik tells Karnilla that his master Geirrodur has ordered her death, prompting Balder to come to her protection, in exchange for his and Sif's freedom. This is a request that Karnilla complies with at least freeing Balder who begins a battle with Ulik. While back on Earth, Thor manages to dodge the disintegrator blast and duck into a dead end alleyway, with nowhere to go he is cornered against a nearly unstoppable foe.\nThis story is continued next issue...\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nLocations:\nCaptured by a human film crew, Triton has been taken in a glass water tank to New York city.

As the seconds before Thor transforms back into Donald Blake tick by, Thor plans to step in front of an oncoming subway train just as he transforms so that, when he is killed as Blake, he might end up in Valhalla as Thor. Unwilling to accept such a risky plan, Sif instead calls upon her own power to bypass space and time to transport them both to Asgard where Thor will not lapse back to his human form even without his hammer. Her plan succeeds, and the two return to Asgard but continue on to the home of the Rock Trolls. There they stumble upon the fact that the Rock Trolls seek to make a replica of Thor's hammer so that they might better crush the Gods and take over Asgard.\nWhile in the city proper, Odin and his forces continue to try and defend the city. However, they are easily fought back by the Rock Trolls and their advanced weaponry, which they forced Orikal to build for them. Believing that he has been abandoned by his son, Odin enters the fray with his Scepter of Power but finds his plan thwarted when the Rock Trolls arrive with an Orikal-created weapon, an Ulti-Force Cannon that drains the scepter of its power, rending it useless. Unwilling to accept defeat, Odin tosses the useless weapon aside and orders his warriors back into battle.\nWhile back in the underground cavern of the Rock Trolls, Thor and Sif find Ulik who has had Orikal create a duplicate hammer. Thor reveals himself to Ulik and uses the enchantment that pulls the hammer back into his possession to divest Ulik of one of the hammers in his hands. Although both have an equal weapon, Thor is able to gain the advantage in combat. Witnessing Ulik's failing performance in battle, Geirrodur grabs a Menti-Horn and commands Orikal to destroy the Thunder God. In response, an enchantment lifts Thor and Sif off the ground and holds them in the air, helpless targets for the javelins of their enemies. Needing to escape, Thor smashes a hole in the nearby wall and he and Sif pass through into another chamber where they find Orikal who explains to them that he only fights for Geirrodur because the King of the Rock Trolls has him enslaved with mystical flames. As Thor tells Orikal that there is another way, Ulik enters but, overcome by his hatred of Orikal, he doesn't even see the Asgardians, so focused is he on killing his rival. Once Thor seals off the cavern from any other pursuers, he and Sif watch as Ulik goes to the switch that controls the flames and turns it so full heat, something that will almost instantly kill Orikal. Thor quickly knocks Ulik out before he can throw the switch and then offers to free Orikal instead. Once Orikal reveals that the weapons he had been forced to provide to the Rock Trolls will become eternally useless after he leaves, Thor turns off the flames which quickly grow cold. Now free, Orikal transforms into an aura of shimmering, glowing energy which immediately departs.\nAs Geirrodur arrives to discover that Orikal is gone, the tide of battle turns and the Rock Trolls are sent fleeing back to their domain. Realizing that, without Orikal's power, they no longer have any chance of victory, Geirrodur agrees to surrender and complies with Thor's demand that the Rock Trolls return to their home. Thor then uses the Rock Trolls' tunnel to return to the city of Asgard where he is reunited with his father and hailed as a hero once more by the people of Asgard.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nRaces:\nLocations:\nItems:\nSending away his evening entertainment, Mogul learns from his adviser that Thor and the Warriors Three are seeking out the location of Mystic Mountain so that Hogun may get revenge against Mogul for killing his people.

This upsets Hogun who believes that they have been tricked, however Thor does not believe so. Thor quickly strikes the ground with his hammer, cracking open the ground and revealing the location of Mystic Mountain's central city (Zanadu) is actually hidden beneath the ground.\nBreaking the glass barrier around the city, Hogun leads the others towards the newly made opening, however before they can enter the city of Zanadu, they are confronted by the Jinni Devil who welcomes the heroes to their doom."

Although he instantly realizes his error, Thor is still startled enough to land on a nearby rooftop where he then recalls his history with Jane Foster, including how their relationship had ended when she failed to become a goddess and the fact that Jane's very essence was now melded with that of the goddess Sif.\nThor then recalls something that happened soon after Jane had made her fateful visit to Asgard. One afternoon, while getting a cup of coffee in his office, Dr. Don Blake noticed that his walking stick had started glowing. When he grabbed hold of it, the enchanted cane began to guide him out the door and up to the roof where, since Blake couldn't fly, he changed to Thor and allowed Mjolnir to guide him.\nArriving at an area outside the city limits, Thor was surprised to find that Jane Foster was there as well and, as she told him that something had drawn her to that spot, the ground opened beneath her and demonic tentacles pulled her down into the pit which then sealed itself. Determined to rescue Jane, Thor used Mjolnir to smash open a chasm so that he could follow, but he was soon swarmed by intangible lights which drained his strength and rendered him unconscious.\nWhen he awoke, Thor realized that he was now in Hades, and soon discovered that Pluto was holding Jane hostage, suspended over a pit of lava by mystical chains. Pluto explained that he wanted vengeance upon Thor, something that Zeus had forbidden him to do, so to get around that decree, Thor's death would be accomplished through the powers of another. Pluto then showed Thor that Loki was his ally. Speaking from Asgard, Loki revealed that he was not physically present because he lacked the brute strength to defeat Thor so he was now conjuring forth a champion to do the deed. At that moment, Ulik appeared in Hades, enraged that someone had brought him there against his will, but Pluto quickly redirected his rage by pointing out the presence of Thor.\nPluto then stated the challenge: Thor and Ulik would battle, whoever was victorious would claim Jane Foster and the loser would remain a prisoner in Hades forevermore. If both died in battle, then Jane would be dropped into the lava. Ulik immediately attacked Thor and the battle began. However, when the battle went on longer than he had expected it would, an impatient Pluto made the mistake of wondering aloud if he and Loki should have used some more formidable champion. Hearing that he was being used caused Ulik to abandon his attempt to kill Thor so that he could claim as his victim the one who tried to use him. Being attacked by Ulik caused Pluto's concentration to weaken and the chains holding Jane aloft to fade away, but Thor saved her before she could fall into the lava. When Ulik caught hold of Pluto and declared that he was going to throw Pluto into his own enchanted flames, a fearful Pluto revealed that those flames could consume even his godly form. Hearing this, Thor realized that Pluto was the only one who could show them the way out of Hades and so he saved Pluto from death. Now having a reason to attack Thor, Ulki tried to grab Jane to use her as a living shield but Thor quickly used Mjolnir to blast him, sending him back to Asgard where he appeared in close proximity to Loki.\nSince Thor had saved his life, Pluto rewarded him by transporting Thor and Jane out of Hades and back to the location on Earth they had been when they were abducted. When Jane assumed that Thor must have been the one who called her there, Thor realized that Pluto had erased Jane's memory of her hellish ordeal and instead claimed that he was just feeling sentimental. Jane then pointed out that a certain doctor would be upset if she was late for their dinner that night so Thor flew her back to her home so as not to tempt the ire of her Dr. Kincaid.\nAs the memory concludes, Thor reflects on how Jane, whom he once did love, is now one in being with Sif, the one that it was written should be his beloved, and this has resolved the turmoil in his heart."

But then Hela appears to claim his soul since he is near death, but Dani opposes her and the X-Men offer battle - she flees.  Storm attacks Loki but is repulsed.  Then Kitty gives Loki an ultimatum - give up or the X-Men disperse and spread the tale of Loki's perfidy all over Asgard, ruining his aspiration to rule it.  At the end, the X-Men take the 'return everything to the way it was' deal, and go home,[6]with the exception of Brightwind who does return with Dani."

He starts by causing havoc in New York City, however his attempts are countered by Thor (in Loki's body), Balder and Sif who have come to find a way to change the body switch.\nWhile in distant Asgard, hearing that Thor has found Loki, Odin becomes furious that the trickster has not been already brought before him and casts his eyes to Earth. Witnessing the battle, and unaware of the body switch, Odin teleports Thor back to Asgard thinking the Thunder God is really Loki. When Thor tries to explain the situation to Odin, the All-Father refuses to listen and mystically places a clamp over his mouth before sentencing him to be banished to Hades.\nWhile back on Earth, Loki uses Thor's man powers to cause a storm and continue terrorizing the Earth. Balder and Sif however attempt to stop Loki but find him too powerful. When Loki grabs hold of Sif, she manages to escape by teleporting back to Asgard, leaving Balder to fight Loki alone, and he is swiftly defeated.\nWhile in Asgard, Sif rushes to get an audience with Odin to tell him of the grave mistake that has been made, however the Grand Vizier tells Sif that Odin is currently preoccupied and that \"Loki\" had been banished to Hades. The Vizir takes Sif to the Cosmi-Screen where she is horrified to find that the \"Hades\" that her love has been sent is none other than Mephisto's realm.\nThinking that Thor is really Loki, Mephisto welcomes the \"trickster god\" with open hands, however when Mephisto touches \"Loki's\" shoulder he feels pain caused by Thor's inherent goodness. Looking deep into the soul of the person before him, Mephisto learns the truth and attacks Thor. Unleashing many mystical dangers, Mephisto is denied a victory due to Thor's basic understanding of Loki's magical powers.\nWhile back in Asgard, the Warriors Three are fighting off a group of Trolls, once they have defeated them (thanks to Volstagg rolling down a stair case and knocking them all out) they are met by Sif who asks them to help Thor, a request they gladly help with. Showing the Warriors Three that Thor and Loki have changed bodies, they agree to travel with her to Hades in order to save Thor from the clutches of Mephisto.\nArriving in Mephisto's realm, the heroes are greeted by the hell-lord, who shows them that they have arrived too late and brings them to Thor's body which has been frozen in a chunk of ice."

Jarvis tells him that Thor isn't there, so the man leaves.  On a nearby rooftop, Thor and Tarene face off, with her wanting to be tested.  She blasts him full on, and he's surprised at her power.  She hurls her hammer, and knocks him through a building into the next one.  She tells him that she knows he's Jake Olson, and she wants to stay with him.  He changes into Jake, and she transforms herself into a form resembling a normal teenage girl, and they leave, watched by the reporter floating above them.  In the Kingdom of the Trolls, the Rock Trolls are starving, and Ulik decides to go to war with Asgard to rectify the situation.  Jake and Tarene go the Memorial Hospital, and Jake asks if Tarene can stay with Hannah and her daughter Amanda.  But Amanda is still upset about the whole situation between Jake and her mom, and when Christine comes in and tells Jake she misses him and then kisses him in front of everyone, Amanda storms off, running outside.  Jake runs out after her.  Down the street, she turns into an alley and bumps into Cal Kramer.  Jake turns the corner and tells him to put her down, but he lowers his glasses and blasts him with heat beams from his eyes.  He then drops Amanda and tells her to run, that she's no longer of use to him.  He then drops his cloaking field, and reveals himself to be Gladiator.  Jake changes into Thor, and begins to battle Gladiator, confused as to why he is attacking him.  During the battle, Thor drops Mjolnir, and Gladiator manages to knock it away,[1]where it lands at the airport.  Gladiator blasts Thor again, sending him flying away to crash into the back of a truck.  A truck that Amanda happened to be running by in her flight.  She sees someone crash into it that looks familiar, and when she opens the back of the truck, she sees Jake Olson, burning."

Odin checking on his sons current condition feels guilty as Thor's condition is at least partially due to the fact that Odin had halved Thor's strength prior to the battle with Seidring. Returning to his throne room, Odin has Seidring brought to him and as punishment has Seidring transported to the realm of the Rock Trolls, who take Seidring to be the king of their barren world.\nWhile in California, Hercules is taken to the set of a new Hercules movie being made by Stardust Studios, the Prince of Power is completely unaware that this studio is in reality a front made by Pluto and Hippolyta, who hope to trick him into signing an Olympian Pact. Under the guise of Stardust Studio owner J.P., Pluto has Hercules do a screen test by fighting a mechanical giant. Passing the \"test\", Pluto rewards Hercules by giving him a large feast.\nBack in Asgard, Thor beings his recovery, even though he's still confined to a bed Thor is taken out to the frozen sea of Marmora by Balder to do some ice fishing. However the outing is marred when Thor misses one of his targets -- a gigantic amphibian creature -- and it attacks their boat, forcing Balder to fight it off and flee the scene.\nWhile back on Earth, Hercules is asked to sign a contract for the movie deal during his feast. Hercules, brashly signs the document, and Pluto reveals his true self and explains that Hercules has signed an Olympian Pact. Both Pluto and Hippolyta boast about how Hercules blindly signed a contract to take over the role of ruling Hades for all eternity.\nAs Hercules is forced to fight Pluto's hordes, in Asgard, Thor has fully recovered and requests Odin to allow him to return to Earth so that he might have a rematch against Hercules. Odin, having put aside his differences agrees to the request and send Thor to California where he finds Hercules battling the hordes of Pluto. Seeing his rival fighting overwhelming odds, Thor decides to lend a hand and jumps into the battle fighting with Hercules side-by-side. Observing the battle, Pluto and Hippolyta boast about their victory, and having accomplished their goal teleport away.\nWhen the two finally defeat the horde of attackers, Hercules tells Thor what has happened, and understanding Hercules' fate, Thor decides that there isn't time for their final battle and departs.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nEvents:\nOdin continues telling Thor, Balder, Loki, and the Warriors Three of the prophesies of Volla about the coming of Ragnarok. According to Volla's visions Loki would stage a revolt against Asgard which would lead to a great war that would destroy their entire kingdom. In the end the Midgard Serpent would destroy Asgard, leaving nothing but a ruined wasteland. Following this, Surtur the Fire God would rise from his realm and set the realm of Asgard ablaze. However in spite of all this destruction, life would soon restart itself in Asgard, with the restoration of life and eventual advancement to it's former state.\nWith his story finish, Odin asks all gathered what they think about the visions. Loki, defiant as ever, speaks out telling Odin that he doesn't believe the old woman's claims and that they are foolish. Odin, however, believes every word and reiterates the fact that Loki will be the cause of Ragnarok."

However in spite of this, Thor argues that he will someday soon stop his mad brother, to which Loki decrees that Thor be sequestered to the dungeons forever more, and guards attempt to take Thor away. Spying on the situation, the Warriors Three come out of hiding upon learning the news and battle Loki's loyal guards however they are soon overpowered and imprisoned themselves.\nMeanwhile in the outskirts of Asgard, two riding soldiers come across a flaming sigel in the shape of Odin's mark, upon their discovery of it it suddenly erupts in a giant explosion. While back in Asgard proper, Thor and the Warriors Three are locked in a cell (although the guards have a slight difficulty fitting Volstagg through the door.) They are left to their own and wonder how they might escape and overthrow Loki's rule when Balder arrives in the dungeon and sets them free. Broken out of their cell, Thor and the Warriors Three team up with Balder to go and save Sif.\nWhile upstairs, Loki asks Sif to be his bride, a request which she declines. For her refusal, Loki forces her to do battle with a female troll. While back at the magical flames, the warriors stare in absolute horror as Surtur, finally free of his imprisonment by Odin rises from the flames and appears in Asgard. The fire demon has decided that he will destroy first Asgard, then the entire universe, marking his arrival by setting the very sky ablaze.\nBack at the palace, Sif battles the female troll until Thor and the others arrive to put a stop to the fight. Loki is once more challenged, however he stays his opponents weapons once more when he uses a enchanti-screen to show them that he has plased Odin in a capsule and sent it to the Sea of Eternal Night, a realm that for those who enter it, sleep for all eternity. With no way for Odin to awake from his Odinsleep, Loki boasts that he will rule the kingdom forever.\nBefore Thor and the others can attack Loki, Surtur announces his impending arrival and begins showering Asgard with flames. When Loki realizes Surturs power he flees like the coward he is, leaving Thor, Sif, Balder and the Warriors Three to band together. While Thor and the Warriors Three rally troops to battle Surtur, the Thunder God sends Balder and Sif on a mission to wake Odin."

But before he can do anything, Thor Girl grabs his cape and flings him back outside.  Thor and Tarene battle, while Christine shows up, answering Amanda's 911 call.  Christine tells Amanda to go home, that she'll take care of Jake.  Christine takes Jake's hand, and making a fist, tries to get him to assume his guise of Thor, but Mjolnir was gone when he changed form, so she has to find it first.  In Asgard, the Rock Trolls attack, and while Balder leads the counter-attack, Sif goes to Earth to find Thor.  Back on Earth, Gladiator dumps over a water tower on Tarene, and then freezes it, encasing her in a block of ice.  Christine senses Mjolnir landed at LaGuardia Airport, and busts through the gates to get to it before Gladiator finds them.  She wraps Jake's hand around Mjolnir, just as Gladiator comes crashing down on top of him.  Jake is replaced by Thor, who then begins to pound on Gladiator.

The farmer was terrorized by a troll who would eat his cows and sheep and in response, he would pray to gods including Odin, Thor, and Balder, although they would sometimes not listen. Loki declared that the farmer and his family were under his protection and killed the troll before insisting that the farmer and his family prayed to him instead of Odin, Thor, or Balder for protection.\nDisguised as an eel, Loki swam underwater, beneath the island of Hlesey, to the castle of Aegir, God of the Seas, and snuck past the guards. Loki burst into a hall where Odin had gathered the other gods to discuss Ragnarok which was heralded by Balder's death. The Jotun was upset that Loki did not invite them although Odin offered to let him drink the ale Aegir was serving them. Heimdall commented that Loki would drink the ale that was given to him although would not cry to save Balder. When Loki claimed that Frigga could not definitely say who Balder's father was, Thor threatened him although Odin ordered him to calm down and claimed that the Jotun's tongue was \"as loose as a woman's\", pointing out that he spent years living as one, causing laughter from even Idunn. When Idunn claimed that Hoder did not deserve to die at Loki's hand, the Jotun insisted that she enjoyed being violated by him before Sif asked him what he was trying to provoke. Loki claimed that he was trying to provoke \"truth\" before Thor was enraged and his rage was heard throughout the Nine Realms. Thor revealed that there was something he did not tell Odin before Loki revealed that he manipulated Hoder into killing Balder. Then, Odin declared that Loki could no longer live in Asgard before the latter transformed into a hawk and flew away.\nLater, Loki fought Thor and was defeated before waking up in chains under a venomous serpent. Thor claimed that he did not kill Loki as \"their story wasn't finished yet\" and that he had a part to play as leading the armies of the dead according to a dream and that he could never kill his brother. After Thor left, Loki imagined the armies of the dead and believed that his destiny was to be feared and that all he had to do was wait."

He summons the Enchantress to his side and asks her to get revenge against the X-Men on his behalf for their defeating him in battle[2].\nMeanwhile, on the island of Kirinos, Storm has brought the New Mutants to the island following their ordeal with the Shadow King[3]. There is trouble, since Karma is in a depressive, near-suicidal state thanks to all the weight put on her body from the excessive indulgences of the Shadow King when he possessed her body. Storm attempts to comfort her, and tells her that she must continue to struggle no matter how bleak things might look for her now.\nThe other New Mutants are down by the beach, where Illyana attempts to explain to Warlock what water is, how to swim and what the proper swimming attire is for men, to a slight success. Getting a tan with Cypher, Illyana listens to Doug's worries about he growing anti-mutant sentiment around the world and wonders if he'll ever feel safe in the world with such bigotry. As Sunspot shows off his diving skills to everyone, Mirage decides to give her teammates an unexpected training session by using her illusion casting powers to make it appear as though they are being attacked by a sea serpent. The catches the Mutants off guard, but they react quickly. When Warlock encases Doug within himself, Doug remarks how he hates always being pushed aside in the face of danger. When Dani appears and explains everything to her friends, they are unimpressed, although she tells them it's important that they maintain their battle edge so that they are never caught unprepared for a fight.\nJust then, a strange eclipse happens over the island, prompting the New Mutants to go seek Storm to see if she knows what is going on. They send Warlock off to scout the skies, but he is struck by a bolt of lightning, prompting Cannonball to go and save him. Promptly afterward, a number of Asgardian warriors come out of the sky and easily subdue the New Mutants, knocking them out and taking then back to their home dimension. Storm finds herself teleported to Asgard before Loki, and before she can do anything, she is encased in mystical crystal by the Trickster God, who also transforms her outfit to one resembling that of Thor's. With Storm subdued, Loki begins his special plans that he has for the former wind-rider.\nThe New Mutants revive in the dungeon of the Enchantress, who confronts the young students. When Magik attempts to teleport them away, the Enchantress triggers a magical feedback that sends the New Mutants scattering across time and space all over Asgard and leaving Illyana a helpless prisoner of the Enchantress. The Enchantress then sends her Troll minions out into Asgard to track down and capture the escaped New Mutants.\nXi'an wakes up to find herself in the middle of a vast desert. Finding herself with no food, water, shelter or friends, she simply collapses on the ground in tears, unable to carry on and wanting to die. Soon, however, she wakes up to the sound of a young girl being chased through the wastes by a giant sandworm creature. Not wishing to see the little girl die, Karma uses her powers to knock the primitive beast out. When the little girl asks Karma to bring her home safely, she agrees to try and help the little girl, deciding that she has no right to lay down and die when someone so innocent needs help. She uses her powers to secure food and water for themselves while trying to find a way out of the desert, and as time passes, Xi'an gradually loses her bulk and returns to her former, slim self. As she finally makes it out of the desert, however, the girl suddenly and inexplicably disappears, leaving only a length of cord wrapped around Xi'an's finger.\nCypher finds himself teleported into the middle of a banquet of Harald Einarson. When Doug is pushed around by some of the Asgardians there, he tries to fight back. Finding the weakling human amusing, they challenge him to fight their serving maid, but he finds that he cannot even lift the sword that they had him. Doug is knocked clear across the room by a single slap, and to the laughter of the men gathered, a slave collar is slapped on him and he is put to work cleaning up after them and serving more food.\nWolfsbane ends up in a forest glade where she finds herself being attacked by three Giants, but she is saved by another wolf, who sends the Frost Giants tumbling. She is shocked to find that this white wolf, who goes by the name of Hrimhari and is a prince of his wolf people, can talk and agrees to follow him, feeling herself strongly attracted to him but unsure about how to respond, due to her strict upbringing. In the end, although she enjoys his romantic attentions, she begins to feel herself torn and breaks away in confusion.\nWarlock finds himself in Hel, where he is low on energy and attacked by a dragon, and he is forced to infect it with the Transmode virus to absorb its energies. Subsequently, Warlock is confronted by Hela, who demands to know who Warlock is and reveals where he is currently situated. The cowardly Warlock decides to flee the scene rather than to remain in a realm of the dead, leaving Hela musing over his nature.\nSunspot fares better than most of the other New Mutants. Finding himself in a bar fight after a patron forces an advance on one of the serving maids, he finds that his powers are greatly enhanced in Asgard, thus matching him with any regular Asgardian male. After clearing out the bar of its unruly visitors, Sunspot is made the tavern's bouncer and wins the fancies of the women around, much to his delight. Later on, the Warriors Three enter the tavern to challenge the boy they have heard so much of. The boastful Voltstagg offers Sunspot the challenge of lifting his heavy mass off of a chair. Sunspot take up the challenge and manages to do it, but pulls something in his back. Despite this, he has earned the respect of the Warriors Three, who take him off to party.\nMagma finds herself before the generosity of some fairies, who give her food and drunk. As she indulges, she begins to feel light-headed and passes out, only noticing at the last moment that these apparently hospitable creatures are really Dark Elves, who proceed to warp her mind and body to make her one of them.\nCannonball finds himself in Nidavellir the realm of the Dwarves. There he is spotted by a war party led by Eitri. Sam begins to ask for their help, but their conversation is cut short when Eitri's wife screams out for her husband as the Dwarves' home is under siege by Rock Trolls. Cannonball manages to fight off the invaders, but he is stabbed in the back by one of them while rescuing Eitri's wife and collapses right after the battle is won. For his deed, Sam is welcomed as a true friend by Eitiri and his daughter, who has taken a fancy on Sam, but then they are attacked by a group of Dark Elves and the warped Magma. During the insuring battle, the Fairies are fought back and Magma is taken prisoner. Sam is worried about the transformation that has come of his friend, but Etiri swears to him that his people will try to find some way to restore her to her human form.\nMirage finds herself in an open field where she finds a beautiful winged horse caught up in a trap. Feeling horrible for the majestic creature, she begins freeing it and feels some sort of connection being established. Right after freeing the creature, she finds herself surrounded by a hunting party, who tells her to let them slay the horse. Dani refuses, and they attempt to attack her, but are eventually scared off by the arrival of a Valkyrie. Their leader, Mist, is surprised to see that one of their horses would bond to a human from Midgard and asks Dani to join them, to which Dani happily agrees. But while Dani stays with the Valkyrie, she once inadvertently overhears that the Valkyrie are shocked and puzzled that her horse, Brightwind, would bond with a human of Midgard and that the bond must be paid \"in blood\"; a statement which prompts Dani to depart at once.\nBack at the fortress of the Enchantress, the mystic becomes tired of waiting for the New Mutants to come and begins torturing Illyana. She decides instead to send her out to capture her teammates, and sucking out the dark half of her soul and manifesting it into a physical form, the Enchantress explains that she is going to send her evil half out to hunt down the New Mutants and that any damage inflicted on it would transfer over to Illyana.\nIn the meantime, Loki decides to continue his manipulations of Storm, transforming her into an eagle so that she can always be at his side. He goes to visit the Dwarves where Sam has just managed to get Magma to shake off the conditioning on her mind influenced by the Fairies. Loki orders Etiri to create for him a hammer just as powerful as that of his brother Thor. When he spots Cannonball among the Dwarves, Etiri covers by telling Loki that he is an \"idiot nephew\". Loki is satisfied with this and teleports away, telling Etiri that he expects the hammer soon. Recognizing the transformed Storm and smelling trouble for his friends, Sam decides to take off with Amara.\nBack at the bar where Sunspot hangs out, Roberto is taken off guard by Magik's Demon form, who easily captures him and makes him her minion. The same happens with Rahne right before Hrimhari's horrified eyes. At the court of Einarson, Cypher lands into some trouble when one of the men maliciously trips him, causing him to spill food all over Harald. Before he can be whipped for it, Illyana arrives with an army of Demon Riders, who slay Harald and attempt to capture Doug. Doug jumps out a nearby window and is reunited with Warlock, who has succeeded in tracking him down. After Warlock is forced to blast Magik, the two flee the scene together and later join up with Xi'an, who has just managed to find her way out of the desert. The three are then forced to confront Illyana, their corrupted friends and their entourage, with the added participation of Sam, Amara and Dani, who chance upon the scene and swiftly join the fight. Cannonball and Magma are instantly captured, but Cypher and Warlock (with Warlock encasing Cypher as a living battlesuit) prevent Karma from being possessed.\nWith the battle fought to a standstill, Karma uses her powers to take control of the Illyana simulacrum, breaking the Enchantress's connection to it and forces it to bring them back to her castle. They make it appear as though Illyana had won, but when the Enchantress comes out to gloat, the reassembled New Mutants reveal their ruse and easily overpower her. Meanwhile, Karma has the demon form of Illyana lead her to the dungeon where she finds Illyana broken and beaten, but when Karma allows the simulacrum to remerge with Illyana, the damage is reversed and she is freed. When the Enchantress teleports down and attacks, the New Mutants overpower her once again and Magik summons S'ym to take her away to Limbo. Realizing that Loki is behind this whole plot and that Storm is still missing, the New Mutants vow to make him pay for what he's done.\nThis story is continued inX-Men Annual#9..."

In order to search for his foe unnoticed, Thor taps his hammer and changes back into the mortal form of Donald Blake, playing right into the plot that Geirrodur (ruler of the Rock Trolls) had intended for the Thunder God to do. This transformation is picked up by one of the Rock Troll devices and relayed to Ulik who is hiding out with the unconscious Sif in New York's subway system with an army of Rock Trolls.\nThey use a \"Molecular Disperser\" to make the street under Donald Blake intangible so that they can grab him and pull him below to a tunnel where they immediately take his walking stick from him. As Ulik demands that Blake explain how the cane works, the Rock Troll holding the cane, deciding to take the power of Thor for himself, quietly asks Blake how the cane works. Taking advantage of the fact that only he may cause the enchantment that changes the stick into his enchanted hammer, Blake explains its operation to the Troll. When the Rock Troll taps the cane, Blake quickly darts a hand out so that he is grasping it as it strikes the ground and he is transformed into Thor once more. Regaining hold of his hammer, Thor renews his battle against Ulik.\nWhile back on Asgard, the Rock Trolls invasion of the realm begins and on they succeed in defeating Asgard's first war party, taking them all prisoner before they can send anyone back to get reinforcements. Informing Geirrodur of the victory, the king of the Rock Trolls decides to check with Orikal to learn of the progress of their team which is digging a secret tunnel into the heart of Asgard itself. Orikal advises Geirrodur that his forces are nearing the city of Asgard and that their attack will begin soon.\nMeanwhile, back on Earth, Thor and Ulik's battle rages on. Even though Ulik has the advantage of having a small army to help him, Thor manages to beat them all aside. Thor then finds the body of Sif, and begins trying to figure out a way to free her body when one of the Trolls sneaks up behind him with the Orb of Orikal. Thinking that it is a weapon to use against him, Thor throws his hammer and realizes too late what it's meant for: capturing his hammer. Succeeding in collecting Thor's hammer, the Rock Trolls then teleport back to Asgard to join their comrades in their battle against Asgard. As they depart, Sif is freed from the cocoon that she has been trapped in and learns of the grave situation, stuck on Earth with Thor who will change back to Donald Blake in 60 seconds without his hammer, and neither with a way to return to Asgard.\nWhile back on Asgard, the Rock Trolls begin their attack on the kingdom of Asgard with all their forces. Odin sends all his troops to counterattack but they prove unable to stop the advancing attackers and Odin calls to his son for help. Back on Earth, Thor hears these cries but feels only helplessness as he is unable to answer them.\nThis story is continued next issue...\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nLocations:\nContinued from last issue....\nSeeking to get revenge against Mogul for slaying his people, Hogun and his friends Thor, Fandral and Volstagg seek out Wazir, a prophet who knows the location of Mystic Mountain, the home of Mogul. However, in order to get to Wazir, they have to get past the cyclops known as Ogur but he will not let them pass without a fight and attacks the four warriors. After a brief battle, Thor and the Warriors Three manage to battle Ogur into submission until Wazir -- roused from his meditations by the din of battle -- comes from his cavern to know what the commotion is.\nHearing of the warriors plea to be transported to Mystic Mountain, Wazir agrees to teach them the location. He has Thor, Fandral and Hogun hold his wooden staff and they suddenly are imparted with the knowledge of Mystic Mountain's location.

No dialogue, no captions, no word balloons or sound effects. Nothing.\nWith that in mind, the emotional expressions of our characters is more important than ever. Panel design and construction should be more fun because you don't have to worry about balloons. You can run their faces right to the top of the border or fill the panels in any way you want. What you draw is what will see print.\nBackgrounds will be more important, particularly on the upper half of the panel because areas we often think of as being covered up will go uncovered. All in all, it should make for a lot fun. If you have any questions, give me a call!\nPAGE ONE\nSplash. We open on Thor, fairly small in the panel, walking through a majestic hallway that's filled with windows (think of those churches built during the Renaissance) that tower high above him. It's night, so heavy, black shadows blanket the hall. Floating high above Thor is a wispy image of Odin. Also note that Thor's beard should be more full than last issue. The impression here is that Thor should seem almost lost in the shadows, perhaps the loneliest man alive.\n\nPAGE TWO\nWe stay with the action, pulling the camera back even farther as Thor descends a massive stone staircase. Let's add aspects of Asgard to the scene. Maybe statues of long lost Asgardian warriors line the walls. Or dragon heads, like one might find at the head of a Viking boat.\nNow a down shot as Thor gets tot he bottom of the stairs. He's turning toward a doorway not far away.\nCloser on Thor, his lowered in sadness, as he passes through the doorway.\nThor enters a large chamber filled with relics of Viking battle. In the middle of the room is a massive portrait of Odin, leaning back on his throne, adorned in Kirby-like attire while holding his sceptre. Around the walls, various ornate swords, shields, axes, helmets and other weapons hang, each separated by a low burning torch. An ornate bow and quiver filled with arrows should among them. It's a museum of war, with simple benches in the middle of the room.\n\nPAGE THREE\nThe first three panels run across the top of the page. Shot of Thor from the waist up, straight on. His head is still lowered, not visible in the shadows. Behind him is Odin's portrait. Very symbolic in the way Thor is framed against Odin's portrait.\nZoom in slowly as he begins to lift his head up...\n...until he's looking right at us in a tight close-up. Let's keep his emotion subtle here. He's not overwrought by grief, but he's definitely burdened by sadness.\nThen we switch angles to show what's caught his attention. It's the ornate bow and arrow filled quiver.\nBack to Thor, an extreme close shot of his eyes, about as tight as you can make it.\nNow we move into flashback. Make sure this is clear to the reader since we won't have captions. Borderless panels, perhaps? This is from a long time ago, Thor's childhood, when he was about eight-years-old. Young Thor and Loki are in an ornate castle garden playing, as kids do, with wooden swords. The garden is filled with ivy and beautiful plants, all accessed by a stone walk leading to the woods. Loki is swinging his sword, breaking Thor's. *Reference Alert, Marc! Let's dress them as they appeared in the first couple of pages of Thor #6.\n\nPAGE FOUR\nCloser on the two. Thor looks at his sword, frowning. Loki gestures for Thor to follow him. It's clear he has something else in mind.\nThor follows him through a small back door of the castle.\nInside, they scamper along some rafters that run high atop a large chamber within the castle. Down below, Odin and a group of warriors are celebrating a tremendous victory. They're all raising tankards of ale, gnawing on turkey legs or throwing darts. Odin is in the middle of the room, obviously in charge. Leaning against the back of his chair is the same bow and quiver shown on page three. Everyone seems to be ignoring the bow and quiver.\nBack to Thor and Loki, close on them as they look down at it with envy. Loki's envy is more evident and he should almost seem more evil in his desire.\nThey both point at each other as if to say, \"You do it.\" \"No, you do it.\"\n\nPAGE FIVE\nNine panels on a grid for this page. Loki takes a small gold coin from under his belt.\nLoki flips the coin in the air.\nClose on the palm of his hand as it lands heads up.\nClose on a clearly disappointed Thor.\nThor scrambles off, looking a bit nervous. It's his job to get the bow and quiver.\nBack to Loki. Smiling with evil as he looks at one side of the coin...\n...then turns it to show the other side. Clearly, it's a two headed coin, and he's gotten the better of Thor once again!\nNow we move to the action below. A shot of Thor crawling through a \"forest\" of warriors' legs that seem to tower over him. He's within a foot or two of the bow and quiver.\nA few seconds later as Thor races out the doorway of the chamber, all the warriors of Asgard blind to the fact that he has the bow and quiver in his arms. The sense of relief is evident on his face.\n\nPAGE SIX\nWe cut back to the garden a short time later. They're at the edge of the garden, shooting toward one tree that borders the woods. It has a couple of arrows in it already. Other arrows are stuck in the ground around the tree. Loki has the bow and Thor is jumping up and down as though to say, \"Let me have it! It's my turn!\"\nNow keep in mind that this is an adult bow so it's quite a bit bigger than one Thor might handle. It's also Odin's, which means the kids will have a hard time using it. Loki is handing it over to a very excited Thor.\nThor tries to draw the string back but he's having a tough time. Loki is laughing at his struggle, teasing Thor.\nClose on Thor's face, a study in kids' concentration. One eye is closed, a bit of his tongue is sticking out as he pulls back the string a bit more.\nPull the camera back for a mid shot to show the action. Loki is slapping Thor on the back as he laughs, which is causing Thor to let go of the string before he wants. The arrow is flying off the bow in a slightly errant direction.\nPAGE SEVEN\nFocus on the arrow as it flies past the tree, a beautiful deer in its path.\nCut back to Loki and Thor. Loki's expression is simply one of , \"Oh nuts! We're in trouble now!\" Thor's is one of horror.\nPull the camera way back as Loki turns and flees. Thor walks toward the woods, very hesitantly...\n...and kneels in front of the deer, now dead, with an arrow sticking out of its hide.\nClose on Thor, tears running down his face.\n\nPAGE EIGHT\nStill in flashback, but we cut now to Odin and the warriors at the party. Odin seems to be telling them a story or something but the warriors' attention is diverted by something off panel.\nReverse angle as Odin turns to see a stoic Thor walk into the room with the bow and quiver.\nThor breaks down as he confesses, clearly spilling everything. He should seem almost dwarfed by Odin's size and sheer presence. Thor might well be expecting the worst here.\nBut Odin lifts him with his massive hands...\n...and gives Thor a hug.\n\nPAGE NINE\nCut back to the present. Close on Thor as he lifts his head, a faint smile of remembrance on his face. Remembering this has brought a moment of joy to an otherwise terrible day.\nThen we pull back the camera as Balder enters the room. Thor turns.\nAs an old, dear friend might do in such a situation, Balder puts his hand on Thor's shoulder as they look at the portrait.\nClose on the portrait of Odin. We'll be seeing this all the time so let's make it one that really conveys his power, as well as his humanity.\nThen a close on Balder's eyes, steeped in sadness. Make sure we see something of his helmet to make sure the readers know it's Balder and not Thor.\n\nPAGE TEN\nWe move into flashback once again. (I still like the idea of border less panels. Just like those old Gold Key comics!) This time, Balder (his adult self!) is on the floor of a dirty, musty cave. He's bound by ropes, laying on his side with his hands behind his back. His knife and sword are a few feet away, close to a fire. Three or four trolls are jumping around and holding their swords into the fire, clearly planning on skewering Balder! The trolls each have numerous swords, maces and other weapons strapped to their belts.\nOne of the trolls removes the spear from his fire...\n...and holds it right up under Balder's nose, as though he's about ready to carve his face open.\nInstead, he draws it down across his chest, ripping Balder's tunic and chain mail open! The other trolls are laughing heartily. They're going to take their time with this one!\n\nPAGE ELEVEN\nOne of the other trolls steps up and kicks Balder in the face, as hard as he can!\nStructure the shot so we see all the trolls standing around Balder, continuing their kicking and stomping. In the foreground, Balder's knife and sword are visible. A hand is reaching into the panel from off panel. (It's Odin's hand, but don't tip it all away yet.)\nOdin's gloved hand picks up the knife...\n...and tosses it softly, allowing it to land in front of Balder.\nShot from Balder's POV as he sees the knife...\nPAGE TWELVE\n...and rolls to it, knocking a couple of the trolls aside.\nHis hands still behind him, he grabs the knife...\n...cuts his ropes...\n...and in a big panel, comes up fighting!\n\nPAGE THIRTEEN\nNow Balder grabs his sword so he has a weapon in each hand...\n...and nails one of the trolls while the others cower.\nClose on Balder as he looks toward the cave entrance. Make sure it's sunny outside so it can account for a shadow. In any case, Odin is obviously standing outside the cave, monitoring events, but his shadow gives him away.\nSmall close on Balder, smiling.\nCut back to the present where Thor and Balder now sit on the bench. Balder is laughing about the experience, presumably telling Thor how Odin wanted to spare his feelings of insecurity, allowing him to beat the trolls. Thor is smiling a bit more now. Behind them, Sif is entering.\n\nPAGE FOURTEEN\nFull shot as Sif takes Thor's hand as though to comfort him. Odin's portrait is prominent in the shot.\nView from behind as Sif looks at the portrait.\nThen we fade into flashback again. This time, Sif and several male warriors are walking out of an arena. At this point, Sif should appear to be about 15-years-old, the males in their early twenties. They're dirty, their clothes torn, their faces dirty, but their smiling broadly, like a group of college athletes who just won the title to whatever sport they played. Let's make it clear that they were involved in skills of contest, and that a number of other, defeated warriors are laying on their backs in the arena. Dented shields and broken weapons should lay about. In the stands, Odin and other adult warriors are cheering the results.\nLong shot as they walk the streets of Asgard, clearly headed for a corner bar. They're still arm in arm, celebrating their win. If, on the sign, you can somehow indicate this bar is a bawdy place for men only, please do so.\n\nPAGE FIFTEEN\nBut a strange thing happens when they get to the bar. The men enter first, while the last two turn and tell Sif she can't come in. She's stunned, appalled that they'd treat her thus!\nSif hurls her glove at the feet of one of the men who's laughing at her reaction.\nAs she tries to enter the guy pushes her back, causing her to lose her balance...\n...until she falls at Odin's feet. Odin has arrived and he is pissed as hell at the men.\nOdin steps into the dark bar, his arm raised, his anger evident, as the men inside cower, barely able to believe what's happening. The only women inside are scantily clad waitresses and dancers.\n\nPAGE SIXTEEN\nAngle the shot from behind Sif as she's getting to her feet. Odin is standing in the doorway where he's gently beckoning her to come inside, a friendly expression on his face.\nBack to the interior, as all the men take one knee while Odin and Sif walk inside, clearly breaking some long established barrier. Odin has paid her the respect none of the male warriors would.\nWe cut back to the present. Sif, Balder and Thor are all on their feet, looking up at Odin's portrait.\nThor places his hand on the portrait, his head no longer lowered, but held high, as though he's truly proud to be Odin's son.\nThe three of them leave the chamber. Thor has one arm around Sif's waist and another on Balder's shoulder. They're a family, more so now than before Odin's death.\nPAGE SEVENTEEN\nWide shot of the room, seemingly empty, except for a wisp of smoke that seems to be materializing in thin air.\nOut of the smoke steps Loki, who's materializing in the room.\nLoki steps close to the portrait, his face cold and emotionless. We want this mysterious, as though we don't quite know what he's thinking.\nClose on Loki's eyes, narrowing, still emotionless.\nWe move into flashback. This sequence will take place shortly after Thor confessed to Odin in the first chapter of the book. Young Loki is sitting against a tree in the woods, laughing, flipping his precious two headed coin.\n\nPAGE EIGHTEEN\nCloser, as Loki flips the coin in the air. He should look quite pleased with himself, for once again, that stupid Thor will catch hell!\nSame angle as the coin doesn't come back down to his hand. Instead, it lands in the palm of Odin's hand, which is coming in from off panel. Loki's eyes are wide open as he looks off panel, suddenly aware that things might not quite work the way he planned!\nOdin is firm, but he doesn't yell. Whatever you do, don't have him be in a rage, Stuart. Loki, jumping to his feet is the one who's yelling, trying to get his coin back.\nBut Odin crushes it, causing Loki to really flip out.\nOdin puts his hand on Loki's shoulder in an attempt to calm him, to try to relate...\n...but Loki breaks away from his grip and runs away, as Odin lowers his head, saddened that no matter what, he cannot get through to his child.\n\nPAGE NINETEEN\nCut back to the present, Loki staring at the portrait. He's frowning. This isn't pleasant for him.\nLoki takes a step to the side...\n...and punches the block wall as hard as he can. We need to convey some sense of emotional pain here.\nLoki exits the room into a hall filled with high windows.\nHis attention is caught by something off panel.\nLoki looks out the window, amazed!\n\nPAGE TWENTY\nThis is where we introduce the new monarch of Asgard. We move down below to a the very edge of Asgard, where the rainbow bridge joins with the city. The city's entire population seems gathered here, all our notable characters such as Sif, Balder, the Warriors Three, Beta Ray Bill, Frigga, Heimdall, Jake Olson and Tarene. An old Viking boat hovers at the edge of the bridge. A procession of individual warriors are lined up, each entering the boat one at a time.\nCloser on the scene, showing us what's happening inside the boat. There's a table in the middle of it with an ornate helmet on it. Let's make it the same helmet that Odin is wearing in the portrait we saw earlier. Asgardians are each dropping a memento around the table. Some are dropping single roses, others a relic of battle like a knife, an arm band or something similar. Some have left books or telescopes.\nThey stop, looking off panel, as one last person enters. He's in the shadows, but it's someone wearing an impressive suit of armor.\nHe enters the boat. Shoot the scene so that he's in the foreground, and we can see him holding Thor's helmet while Mjolnir is tucked in his belt.\nThis is, of course, Thor, though we don't want to tip too much of it yet. This is a close shot of his hand placing his helmet on the table next to Odin's.\nThen a small shot of his hands picking up Odin's helmet...\n\nPAGE TWENTY-ONE\nSplash. This is the shot that has to sell the future of the book. It's Thor, wearing an elaborate Kirby-like suit of armor, something Odin himself would wear, and he's putting Odin's helmet upon his head. Everyone there is kneeling, acknowledging the new regent of Asgard. All the Asgardians are kneeling on the bridge while Thor stands at the edge of it as the boat floats next to it. Not far away, Loki is flying into the scene.\n\nPAGE TWENTY-TWO\nSmall close on Thor as a small ball of flame coalesces in the palm of his hand (thanks to the Odin power!)...\n...and he touches the bow of the boat, pushing it away, and setting it afire at the same time.\nThe boat floats off into space, burning.\nThor kneels as do all the others, Loki included.\nBack to the boat, floating away, now completely aflame.\nIt floats off into the distance...\n...until the flame is extinguished in the void of space.\nBack to the bridge, all the Asgardians on one knee with their head down, except for Thor, who's still on a knee but is looking forward, appearing in complete control, ready to lead Asgard into a new age.\nAnd that's it! Jurgens\nJuly 20, 2001\nStuart: I can't thank you enough for stepping in like you did. The art you turned in was a joy to script! Good luck in whatever you take on next!"

The cavalry arrives in the form ofOdinand theValkyries.Jane FosterandBladetake down theWar Witchesthat were disrupting Doctor Strange's magic, allowing him to cast a spell to finish evacuations. However, the spell is too powerful and all combatants in the side ofMidgardare taken out of the fight, leaving the Valkyries at the mercy ofMalekith's army.\nSince they have been forced to retreat into theAvengers Mountain, the heroes begin to plan their next steps.Freyjadecides to command a mission to rescueThorfromJotunheim, andOdinspeaks about theBlack BifrostinSvartalfheim.Captain Marvelplans to gather an army to fight the war in the battlefront, andDaredevilspeaks toSifsince they need to find a way to help the blindedHeimdallto see. In Manhattan, all the Valkyries have fallen to the enemy forces, andValkyrieis slain by Malekith himself. Meanwhile, numerous reports begin to pour from all over the world since Malekith's army has begun to mobilize across the entire globe.\nInGreenwich Village, a conglomeration of people gather aroundDoctor Strange'sSanctum Sanctorum.Zelma StantonandBatsguide them into the entrance as part of an evacuation protocol.Jane Fostercomes out of the building and reports Bats that while some of theAsgardianrefugees are inside, there is still aSkidbladnirflying from theThe Bronx. Jane suddenly becomes transfixed; the narration explains she finds herself filled with a calling she thought she would never hear again.\nIn the streets ofManhattan, thePunisherunloads his arsenal on a band ofDark Elves, who remain defenseless due to his use of iron bullets. An elf tries to sneak behind him, but he is promptly stabbed from behind byWolverine. The two vigilantes make small talk, with Frank commenting he heard Logan was dead, and resume fighting. The narration elaborates thattrollsare rampaging through theTheatre District,War Angelsare attacking the Upper West Side, theFire Goblinsare burning upSoHo, andHell's Kitchenis frozen inFrost Giantice. In one building in such predicament,Captain Americais helping evacuate the Tennants. He jumps through a window, hitting a Frost Giant in the face and cushioning his land on a car. The Frost Giant falls behind him. Steve talks withIron Man, who is flying along War Angels. Stark points out that there are too many civilians in the line of fire, and asksBlack Pantherif they can use their teleporter inAvengers Mountain. In the middle of a fight, T'Challa explains that he is completely cut off from the mountain, orWakanda. In fact, networks are crashing all over the globe. Somewhere else,Dario Aggersits leisurely at a coffee shop table, holding a conversation on his phone with aRoxxonemployee involving a global cyberattack they have just launched. Black Panther asks Doctor Strange to use magic to finish civilian evacuation, but he mentions he is having issues with his magic.\nMalekith the Accursedoversees from a rooftop the chaos ravaging the city, rejoicing in the struggle ofMidgard's heroes. He is accompanied by hisbog tigerand theWar Witches, who are the reason Strange's powers are being interfered with.

She's abruptly run over by a Skidbladnir piloted by Jane, and she gets off to join the battle against Malekith, to Freyja's surprise.\nA Frost Giant stomps on the boat, sending Jane and Freyja flying away. In the foreground, Spider-Man is knocked out and at Sindr's mercy.Captain Marvelpunches the giant,Muspelheimfireflies make their way to the subway, and Hulk is overpowered by trolls. These scenes are accompanied by the narrator recounting that Midgard has never such an invasion, and that Manhattan will fall and be followed by other major cities. Jane and Freyja look up to the sky, alarmed by the sound of theWar Horn of Asgard.OdinridesSleipnirout of a portal, accompanied by a legion ofValkyries. In the middle of his cries of war, Odin pierces through a Frost Giant. Jane approachesValkyrie, and asks her to take her to Malekith. She also tries to make Brunnhilde recognize her as the former Thor. The heroes get their second wind and begin to fight alongside the Valkyries. Odin blasts Sindr and Ulik, interrupting the Queen of Cinder's exclamation of surprise at his survival. Odin brushes off the assault he suffered at the hands of the Dark Elf assassins and cries out for Malekith. Odin comes near Freyja, and she informs him aboutLoki's death.Laufeyappears from the side and thrusts Odin into a building with the jib of a broken crane.\nIn the air, Jane and Valkyrie rideAragornwhile striking War Angels until they spot Malekith. Brunnhilde recognizes Jane as the former Thor, but decides to drop her at the top of a building nearby for her safety before taking on Malekith on her own. Jane finds herself in the same rooftop as the War Witches, and sneaks up on them as they're using magic to restrainBlade, who had pinpointed them as the source of Strange's problems. Jane slashes the hair of a witch from behind, startling them. With the interference down, Doctor Strange begins to chant a spell. A portal of blue energy opens below him, and tendrils extend out of it. Freyja helps Odin get up, noticing he still suffers from the Dark Elves' knife wounds.\nFlying on his bog tiger, Malekith orders his troops to close down the portal. He's intercepted by Valkyrie, who commands her kind to protect it. Blade and Jane stand with the War Witches dead on their feet, and they notice the energy tendrils begin to envelope them. Captain America tries to warn Doctor Strange that his spell is too powerful and it's evacuating combatants as well, but Stephen is out of control. The heroes as well as the citizens appear at the Avengers Mountain. Strange waveringly explains the spell was too powerful to control. Jane insists they have to go back, but Freyja, still supporting Odin, warns her that Malekith's forces are too powerful and they can't return. If they want a chance of victory, she reveals they will need to journey elsewhere. Freyja relies thatThoris trapped inJotunheimand they need to save him. Weakly, Odin interjects that they need to go toSvartalfheimand take out theBlack Bifrost, which is how Malekith moves between realms.Sifpoints out that the enemy is in New York, and tells Black Panther to send them back. T'Challa explains that all major systems are down, and declares that it's time theAgents of Wakandadeal with Roxxon. Captain Marvel and Captain America strategize, and Steve agrees with her suggestion to assemble an army to fight this war in the trenches.

Sif approaches Freyja to argue against her planning, mentioning that without his eyesight,Heimdallcan't know where to send them.Daredevilsteps it and suggests Sif talks with him about this. Freyja acknowledges the risks of the situation, and decides to name Jane the All-Mother of Asgard, refusing to leave her people without a leader. Freyja finds Jane crying in front of computer screens, mumbling that they should have gone back. On TV, the news fromRoxx Newsreport that the Valkyries have been slaughtered by Malekith's forces.\nIn the streets of Manhattan, the corpses of the Valkyrie lie on the ground. The narration elaborates on the legend surrounding their labor of ferrying slain souls toValhalla. Ravaged by battle, Valkyrie stands on top of a pile of fallen monsters, swinging her sword at her enemies. She goads Malekith into battle, and she's suddenly stabbed from behind. The narrator ponders who will ferry their souls if the Valkyrie themselves have fallen. The narrator declares that the time of gods and Valhalla has ended, and the bloody age of Malekith has begun. Brunnhilde kneels in shock, and behind her, Malekith prepares to deliver the final blow. The audio of news reports from all over the world fills the air: Frost Giants have invadedLos Angeles, Dark Elves attackLondon, trolls rampage throughAustralia, Fire Demons terrorizeShanghai,South Africais being attacked by War Angels, and theDraugrmarch acrossBrazil. One report encourages people to pray and hope some god is listening. Malekith impales Valkyrie. The narrator attests that no god is listening.\nThe world at war!

As they charge towards him, Galactus attempts to stomp on them; asking if he correctly heard them say they're ready to die. As he prepares to blast them with the Power Cosmic, thunder rumbles and bolts of black lightning split the sky, Galactus irately turning to face the oncoming King Thor. The Goddesses of Thunder react first with joy and then horror as King Thor dives through the sky, holding Mjolnir in his left hand; and covered inblack armor formed of living darkness, with his right arm transformed into a sword made of the same. Letting out a furious battle-cry, the Necro-Thor plunges through Galactus' torso, knocking him to the ground.\nInthe present,Thor the Avenger- restrained by several Trolls - states that the they will be imprisoned inNastrond Prisonfor invading Midgard, provided he sees fit not to execute them all on the spot.Ulikpunches Thor in the chest with a knuckleduster, saying Trolls make their homes wherever they please before disparaginghis mother. Minotaur interrupts, saying the Trolls have had their fun but that it's now time to get down to business. Dropping into a crouch, Minotaur rams Thor and ploughs him into Bill's Diner, destroying it. Exiting the wreckage, Minotaur tells the Trolls to murder and pillage as they please, and to raze Broxton to the ground. Thor chokes out that Aggar is a monster, Minotaur mockingly asking him what he means. Thor explains that - given that Aggar fed his lawyers to Trolls and transformed into a bull-headed beast with strength rivallingthe Hulk's... he's now free to cut loose. Thor punches Minotaur hard enough to send him flying from the heart of Broxton to its outskirts, summoning Mjolnir to his hand before turning to confront Ulik and the other Trolls. As Thor and Ulik clash, the Troll-King sneers thatwaris coming to the Nine Realms and that what's happened to Broxton is but a small taste of what awaits.\nIn the distant future, Necro-Thor declares his intent to kill Galactus, who is shocked that Thor would go so far as to take up the dark blade for the sake of a dying world. Roaring that Galactus should've found something else to eat, Necro-Thor blasts him with black lightning and knocks him over again.\nIn the past, Ulik's Trolls surround a group of humans, who respond belligerently to the casual remarks about eating them. Before the Trolls can make good on their threats,S.H.I.E.L.D.AgentRoz Solomonopens fire and kills them. Contacting her, AgentPhil Coulsonasks why she was radio-silent for hours, Roz responding that since they last spoke she's killed thirteen Trolls - and had never taken a life before that point. Coulson tells her that backup is on its way, advising her to fall back due to her lack of combat experience, but Roz ignores him and continues to fight.\nAs Thor trades blows with Ulik, Minotaur returns to the fight and rams him from behind, goring him with one of his horns. As Ulik pummels Thor, Minotaur states that he won't kill Thor since he wants the god of thunder to bear witness to Roxxon using up all the resources on Earth and leaving it a barren wasteland. Thor stuns them both out with Mjolnir, before picking them both up and smashing them into a Roxxon building. Thor then routes the Trolls before they can kill Roz and dives into the fissure they're climbing out of.\nIn the distant future, Galactus refuses to yield and dares Thor to damn all of the cosmos by killing him. Frigg and Ellisiv urge Thor to not give in the All-Black's deicidal hunger, but Atli shouts that he looks badass in black and urges him to kill Galactus. Stating that he would not have Galactus leave Earth hungry, Necro-Thor tells him to open wide before blasting him with the All-Black-infused Thor-Force, vowing to defend the Earth until the last embers of existence fade into the Void. Galactus and Thor both collapse, seemingly deceased.\nThe following day, Thor the Avenger and his fellow Asgardians arrest the remaining Troll warriors, though Ulik escaped. Dario Agger claims that he was attacked by the Trolls, who killed his lawyers and stole his clothes. Roz informs Thor that none of the townsfolk were killed, calling it a miracle; but Thor disagrees, weeping - the ground where his tears fall being left utterly barren. All-Father Thor regains consciousness, divested of All-Black, and watches as drops of his divine blood fall to the ground. To his and the Goddesses of Thunder's astonishment, plant-life springs forth where his blood fell, turning the area into a field.\nTHE LAST DAYS OF MIDGARD Part Five\n• Thor’s war to save the earth comes to its epic conclusion. In the far future, King Thor makes a dark decision that may save the day, but at what cost?"

The Pharaoh claims that he is immortal and attempts to destroy Cyclops by channeling his powers through an Ankh weapon. As the two mutants battle, the other X-Men are scouring the city, trying to find Cyclops before the police do. Marvel Girl picks up Scott's location with her mental powers and the X-Men speed toward their leader in their jet-car. However, the battle between Cyclops and the Living Pharaoh ends with the Pharaoh easily defeating Cyclops and knocking the mutant hero unconscious.\nCarried away by the Pharaoh's men, Cyclops has a special skin-tight hood put over his head and is placed in a trunk and smuggled aboard a plane to Egypt through New York's JFK airport. In-flight, Cyclops is allowed out of the trunk and is told that he is being taken to Egypt and left alone in the cargo hold. Hearing a faint knocking sound, Cyclops realizes his brother Alex is trapped within an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus and is being smuggled out of the country as well. Detecting Scott's thoughts on the airplane, the X-Men chase after the plane but are shot out of the sky by the Living Pharaoh. The X-Men barely avoids a crash landing in the ocean by Angel's quick thinking. Stuck afloat in the water, the X-Men watch as the plane flies away, Jean vowing to find out where Scott's abductors are going.\nArriving in Egypt, the Pharaoh takes Cyclops and Alex to his pyramid headquarters where he leaves the two to drown in a room that is slowly filling with water. Cyclops manages to use his visor to smash open the sarcophagus, freeing Alex. Alex, in turn, helps remove the hood from Cyclops' face allowing him to use his optic blasts to free them. Attacking the Pharaoh and his men, the two brothers are soon aided by the arriving X-Men who help turn the battle in the hero’s favor. In the battle, the Pharaoh gains the high ground and attempts to use his ankh against the X-Men when suddenly Alex fires energy bolts from his hands that shatter the Pharaoh's weapon, sending him toppling off the top of the pyramid. Saved from a nasty fall by the Angel, the defeated Pharaoh orders his minions to flee the scene until he summons for them again.\nAllowing the Pharaoh's men to escape, the X-Men are shocked to realize that Scott's brother Alex is also a mutant.\nThis story is continued next issue...\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nContinued from last issue...\nHaving developed a taste for adventure and heroics, Warren Worthington III has relocated to New York City where he has taken up the costumed identity of the Avenging Angel. Armed with a specially made gas gun, Warren goes out on patrol and manages to prevent the Grady Gang from robbing a warehouse by knocking them out with his gas gun and calling the police. When the authorities arrive they find the Grady Gang all knocked out and the Avenging Angel's calling card, a halo painted on a nearby brick wall. However, news of Warren's exploits are discounted as a fabrication as the member of the gang who gave testimony is known to be a pathological liar.\nWhile at Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, young Scott Summers and Bobby Drake are watching the news coverage on television. Bobby finds it fascinating, however Scott is less than convinced in the existence of a winged human. Summoned by Professor Xavier, he sends Scott and Bobby out to investigate as Cyclops and Iceman.\nThe following night, the Avenging Angel is out on another patrol when he witnesses a robbery happening at the Atomic Institute. Attacking two crooks who are stealing a strange cylinder, Warren douses them with gas, however a stray bullet knocks Warren's gas gun out of his hand. Swooping down to recover his weapon and relinquish the cylinder from the crooks, Warren gets a whiff of his own gas mixture. Deciding to return the cylinder to the Atomic Institute the next day, Warren then returns to his apartment.\nHe finds Cyclops and Iceman waiting for him, who reveal to the Avenging Angel that he is a mutant and would like him to join their group, the X-Men. Surprised to find the two other mutants there, Warren tells them that he operates as a loner and tells them that anyone attempting to push him around will get pushed back…and hard!\nThis story is continued next issue..."

While there, Scott thinks about how his brother was adopted while he remained at the orphanage and wonders if his brother is also a mutant. After being congratulated by Scott, Alex goes to change out of his cap and gown when he is attacked by men dressed in ancient Egyptian clothing. They are hailing Alex as royalty and telling him that they are minions of a man called the Pharaoh as they gas Alex and take him hostage.\nWhen Scott and the others go to check on Alex, they find his room is empty, but signs of a struggle are visible. With Jean's telepathic abilities, the X-Men track Alex to the Egyptian exhibit at the museum about to be sacrificed by a man named the Living Pharaoh. Interrupting the Pharaoh, the group fights him, learning that he can fire energy bolts from his hands and uses artifacts that he claims are magic, however, are in reality just Egyptian themed weapons.

One night Warren wakes up in the middle of the night to find a large feather in his bed. Going to the bathroom to look at his back, Warren finds that a pair of bird-like wings are starting to grow out.

Desde entonces, Justin se distanció de Jung-Woo.[3]Con el paso de los años, Justin Jin desarrolló una gran corpulencia para un adolescente de su edad, convirtiéndose en un jugador de baloncesto competente.[2]\nCuando Justin tenía diecisiete años, Jung-Woo murió misteriosamente y él recibió las pertenencias de su padre, que incluían una pequeña caja de joyas que contenía un fragmento de laGema Carmesí de Cyttorak. Después de hacer contacto con el artefacto, Justin fue potenciado con la vasta fuerza del imparable Juggernaut.[3]Al presenciar la transformación, su madre le contó la historia de su familia, incluido el destino de su difunto abuelo, quien había sido asesinado porCain Markopor el manto del Juggernaut, y la negativa de su difunto padre a tomar los poderes del Juggernaut por vergüenza. Justin y Hae-Ran fueron entonces confrontados porMalphegor, un seguidor deCyttorakque deseaba adquirir el poder del Juggernaut para sí mismo y había asesinado a Jung-Woo por su artefacto antes de darse cuenta de que lo había enviado a su hijo.[4]Justin y Malphegor lucharon en las calles de Vancouver hasta queDr. Stephen Strangeintervino para rescatar a Justin. Strange y Justin se teletransportaron a uno de los templos de Cyttorak en lasMontañas North Shore, donde Strange aprovechó las energías místicas del templo para proteger a Justin y le explicó el pasado de Malphegor. Malphegor rastreó a los dos y, siguiendo el consejo de Strange, Justin abrazó su legado familiar y convocó su propio traje de armadura de Juggernaut.[5]Justin derrotó a Malphegor y destruyó su bastón, lo que lo despotenció. Strange ordenó a Justin que matara a Malphegor, pero él se negó, dándose cuenta de que el verdadero Strange nunca alentaría el asesinato. Strange se reveló como Cyttorak disfrazado y declaró que tanto Malphegor como Justin eran indignos de ser su avatar después de enfrentarlos entre sí. Justin se negó a participar en el juego de Cyttorak después de lo que hizo a su familia, pero Cyttorak se burló de él ya que Justin solo heredó una parte de su poder y lo dejó solo porque tenía planes más grandes para él. Justin viajó de regreso a pie a la panadería de su madre y expresó su preocupación por los planes de Cyttorak para él, pero Hae-Ran lo alentó a entrenar y perfeccionar sus poderes para estar listo para enfrentar a Cyttorak nuevamente. Después de leer la carta de su padre, que le decía que fuera una versión mejor y más fuerte que él, Justin abrazó su nueva identidad y se convirtió enKid Juggernaut.[6]\nAl enterarse del surgimiento de un Juggernaut en Vancouver, el hermanastro de Marko,Profesor Xavier, guió a un grupo deX-Menpara investigar. Después de conocer a Justin, el Profesor X lo invitó a unirse a la recién reformadaAcademia de Vengadoresen nombre deCapitana Marvel.[1]"

From then on, Justin grew estranged from Jung-Woo.[4]As the years went by, Justin Jin developed a massive bulk for a teenager his age, becoming a proficient basketball player.[2]\nWhen Justin was seventeen years old, Jung-Woo mysteriously died and he received his father's belongings, which included a small jewelry box containing a fragment of theCrimson Gem of Cyttorak. After making contact with the artifact, Justin was empowered with the vast strength of the unstoppable Juggernaut.[4]As the transformation was witnessed by his mother, she shared his family's story with him, including the fate of his late grandfather, who had been killed byCain Markofor the mantle of the Juggernaut, and his late father's refusal to take the powers of the Juggernaut out of shame.

Strange revealed himself to be Cyttorak in disguise and declared both Malphegor and Justin to unworthy of being his avatar after pitting the two against each other. Justin refused to play into Cytorrak's game after what he did to his family but Cyttorak mocked him as Justin only inherited a portion of his power and left Justin to himself as he had bigger plans for him. Justin traveled back on foot to his mother's bakery and expressed his worry over Cytorrak's plans for him, but Hae-Ran encouraged him to train and hone his powers to be ready to face Cyttorak again. After reading his father's letter, which told him to be a better and stronger version of him, Justin embraced his new identity and becameKid Juggernaut.[7]\nWhile trying to be a superhero in Vancouver, Kid Juggernaut was approached byAlpha Flight, but was put off by their intense approach.

It was designed byAmadeus Cho,Nadia Van Dyne, andRiri Williamswith help on technical specifications and building supplies from theVision. The C.M.B. was finished after three weeks of work, and unveiled by the Champions to their teammates,Spider-ManandNova, since they had been busy and didn't even know of its construction.[1]\nAfter Underage Superhuman Welfare Act had been passed that outlawed superhero activity involving those below twenty-one years of age. C.M.B. was confiscated byC.R.A.D.L.E., leaving Champions without headquarters.[2]Later, Champions again gained possession of C.M.B..[3]\nThe Champions Mobile Bunker serves as a transport, clubhouse, and rescue vehicle for the Champions. It includes individual rooms for every core member of the Champions, except Spider-Man and Nova, who share a room, and a restroom. The C.M.B. features the \"Champions Command Center\", where activities from all over the world can be monitored through newsfeeds and satellite readings.[1]"

This led to a conflict between her andThor. Thor could not defeat Quicksand, but saved the surrounding area by launching the nuclear plant into a different dimension. Quicksand retreated, not wanting to meet Thor in battle again.[2]\nQuicksand was then approached byMongoose, an agent of theHigh Evolutionary. The Evolutionary wanted a tissue sample of Thor in order to create a species of super-gods. Mongoose promised Quicksand that the Evolutionary could restore her previous human form, if she could keep Thor busy for long enough for him to hit Thor with a ray and take the samples. However, Quicksand almost could not contain Thor, and she ran away the moment Mongoose finished his task.[3]\nQuicksand later showed up as a member ofSuperia's all-female criminal organization, theFemizons. While the Femizons were on acruise shiptraveling to Superia's island, Quicksand had a disagreement with fellow villainessAnacondathat turned violent. Anaconda's constricting ability proved to be of little use against Quicksand's power, however, leaving Quicksand triumphant.[4]\nQuicksand and Mongoose were apprehended by theThunderbolts, and she agreed to work withBaron Zemo.[5]\nShe later joined theWomen Warriors, an all-female team and part of theInitiativeforDelaware.[6]\nOn that team, and along withConstrictor, she confrontedR.A.I.D.,[7]and later participated toOsborn's attack onAsgard. She was among the squad to personally confrontThor.[8]\nShe was presumably captured and sent to theRaft, which she seemingly escaped from during theFear Itselfevents, whenKuurth (the Juggernaut)broke out. She was seemingly contained byJusticeonLong Islandand handed over to the authorities,[9]but was later defeated byThor GirlandCloud NineinPhiladelphiabefore she could go on a rampage, just before the two heroes were attacked by theLiberteens.[10]\nAfter theAvengers/X-Men conflict, the Raft was damaged and numerous super-criminals were sent to another prison, unfit to store such individuals. A riot exploded, and Quicksand was key in the brawl, until she was defeated by bothRogueandMimic.[11]\nQuicksand later became an experiment forArnim Zolawho was forced to become an employee ofAbsolution Solutionsand experiment on superhuman prisoners. Zola brainwashed Quicksand using a radioactive isotope and forced to go afterD-Cel, amutantcapable of slowing the kinetic movement of people and objects. With help from D-Cel andDamage Control, theJuggernautwas able to stop Quicksand and re-collect her granular body.[1]\nBodily Transformation:Quicksand has the ability to transform the tissues of her body into a malleable substance very similar to sand. In this form, her frame gains an additional 16 inches in height and the sand-like tissues are much denser her human tissues, increasing her overall mass by an additional 400 pounds. While transformed, she possesses various superhuman attributes."

Thor demands to know what she's done to the Nine Worlds, but an incensed Amora turns the question around and tells him he should ask himself what he has done. The two of them begin to fight, and the Enchantress sics her demonic minions on him. The Enchantress blasts him, and when Thor then demands she tell him where they are, she says they're where he put them.\nIron Manis surprised by a group of giants, and since he is outnumbered and his armor has no power, he says he'll surrender. However, when he mentions Thor to them, they club him over the head, knocking him out.\nSteve Rogersexits the bar in the elf village where he has just defeated the patrons, and is soon attacked by three more Dark Elves outside. He defeats them, but is injured in the shoulder. He tells the onlookers that he just wants to find his way home, when an elf woman leaning against one of the houses tells him that will be difficult. She offers to tend his wound, and after looking into her eyes, he agrees to let her.\nTony is taken by the giants to their lordFafnir, who is in his old man form at the time. He is uninterested in Tony until he is told he is a friend of Thor's when, angered by the fact that Thor has killed him before, Fafnir transforms into his dragon form.\nThe elf woman,Mageth, treats Steve's injuries by her fireside, and he tells her she reminds him of his friendWanda, who he feels he failed. He also tells her he feels history is repeating itself, as he has turned against his 'brothers'. When he wonders why he is unburdening himself like this, Mageth reveals it's because she's empathic. He asks her where they are.\nAs Thor has asked the Enchantress the same question, she says that to answer that question he will have to ask where Asgard is. In Mageth's home, Steve tells her Asgard is on Earth, much to her surprise. Meanwhile, Fafnir rages at Tony that Asgard should not be on Earth. Mageth tells Steve that it appears the Nine Realms have bled into each other. The Enchantress shouts at Thor that he destroyed the balance of the Nine Realms, but Thor protests his innocence and ignorance of what's happening. Fafnir decides Thor is to blame for what's occurring and elects to start torturing Tony to make Thor suffer, while in Vanaheim Thor tells the Enchantress that he will fix what has gone wrong, and if she won't help she should get out of his way. Mageth finishes treating Steve's wound, and they kiss.\nThor hears a voice saying he should have listened to the Enchantress, and the Enchantress says they cannot leave because they are in \"her\" world. The speaker is revealed to beHela, who tells them she has reshaped what remains of the Nine Realms in her own image. Thor tells Hela she won't prevail, and attacks her withMjolnirand lightning. Steve and Tony each see Thor's lightning in the distance, and Tony tells Fafnir that he should run."

Doctor Strange conceals them with more magic, and Brother Voodoo fails to find them, although he claims that Doctor Strange is the Master of the Mystic Arts and that he could easily conceal himself and the other heroes without Brother Voodoo’s knowledge. Brother Voodoo leaves with the Mighty Avengers, but Iron Man stays behind. He attempts to reason with the invisible Secret Avengers, but they do not respond and he leaves. Peter Parker asks why they are in hiding and Luke Cage replies that they are doing things the way that they want to, and confesses his paranoia that someone has been manipulating recent events such as the Raft breakout, HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D., the Secret War, and the Civil War. While the heroes consider this, Wong sees something and warns his master.\nDoctor Strange and the Secret Avengers notice that Clint Barton, the former Hawkeye, has come to see Doctor Strange. Although initially suspicious of him, the Secret Avengers reveal themselves. Luke Cage angrily confronts him, asking him why he has not sided with Tony Stark. Barton decides to leave, but Wolverine reveals that they are going to Japan, much to Luke Cage’s annoyance. Cage is adamant that Barton shouldn’t accompany them. Doctor Strange offers to cast the Spell of Tartashi, which would show purity of spirit and reveal if anyone in that room was living with deception towards them. The spell does not affect any of the Avengers (Strange claims that anyone attempting to deceive them would be suffering a seizure) and Cage agrees to let Barton come along, under the guise of Ronin.\nThe scene changes to the present, where the Avengers are in the Silver Samurai’s house, surrounded by the Hand. Luke Cage attempts to stall Elektra whilst waiting for Wolverine to heal from the Silver Samurai attempting to decapitate him. Elektra sees through the façade, however, and throws a sword to Maya Lopez, who stabs Doctor Strange in the abdomen, starting a fight between the Avengers and the Hand. As the Avengers are slowly overpowered, Doctor Strange lies dying on the floor…"

WhiteDarren Shan\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nGreg Salinger explains his past and talks about how he has improved his life. In particular he takes great pride in his new job as a psychotherapist and his man purse. In one therapy session Salinger is attempting to help Rodney, who reveals he is wearing dried blood and that his name is Young Red Skull. Hearing this Salinger theorises that Rodney is trying to become a \"icon-junior thing\" (which Rodney disputes) and talks over the past Foolkillers and that history of the name. He especially takes issue with Kurt Gerhardt and his actions while being going under the name Foolkiller. Salinger uses his past experience following the Foolkiller ideology to show Rodney that he is a \"victim of an idea\" and is able to get him to wash the blood of his face.\nSalinger talks through how and why he actually became a psychotherapist, ending his career as the Foolkiller. While being sent to kill a former mafioso Salinger discovered he had S.H.I.E.L.D. protection and got thrown through a window. Having took a shard of glass out of his arm, Salinger questioned his purpose and looked back on his old Zorro style suit and his time in Deadpools Mercs for Money.After he realised he had no actual purpose Salinger willingly surrendered to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.\nFlashbacking back to the present, Salinger's on the phone to Captain Gary Span who has helped him to start a new life.  Salinger reports on the session and starts to believe that he's found his new passion in life. Before ending the call Salinger predicts that Rodney would actually make an excellent S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit especially due to his connections. After the call ends Captain Span walks up to a man with a bag over his head kneeling on the floor. When the hood is removed the man on the floor decrees that Span operation would be shut down and that he's a traitor. Span promptly executes him and orders one of the two guards nearby to have it cleaned up.\nLying on her bed Melanie Hawkins (Salingers partner) attempts to entice Salinger out of the bathroom. After much persuasion Salinger comes out of the bathroom wearing one of his old suits, starting to kiss Hawkins.\nAt their next session Salinger uses a \"tiny cosmic cube replica\" to hypnotise Rodney, so they can better understand why Rodney resonates with Johann Schmidt. Salinger explains multiple similarities such as both having a poor relationship with their parents and both wanting to become a larger icon than the man they looked up to.While explaining how Rodney was effected by his fathers beatings, Rodney reveals that he wasn't actually abused. Salinger realises that he managed to hypnotised himself and tries to play it off.\nLater that night Salinger is out with Melanie at a Chinese restaurant. However while they're eating Salinger receives an emergency call from Rodney and leaves to meet him, bringing his man purse with him. After reaching the loading dock where Rodney is Salinger discovers that Rodney killed a group of men who tried to get him to do a job for them. Rodney breaks down and begs Salinger to tell S.H.I.E.L.D. that it wasn't his fault. After promising he will Salinger breaks Rodneys neck and lies his dead body down. While trying to comprehend what he did another group of men looking for Rodney approach and discover the group of dead men. Salinger enters into the van with his bag and gives into his desire to kill more fools. Taking his equipment out of his bag Salinger changes into his Foolkiller armour and prepares to attack the gang of men."

As they reach the secret Akkaba Metropolis underneath the North Pole, Archangel corrects that the next age will be named after himself, in which his utopia would be devoid to normal humans. Venturing into the city, Archangel has Autumn Rolfson's son, Genocide, released. Genocide kneels down and swears fealty to Archangel.\nIn the present, at Cavern X, Archangel and his followers have subdued Deathlok and are confronting X-Force, who have just returned from the Age of Apocalypse dimension. Fantomex attempts to use his misdirection powers, but Archangel has developed countermeasures against it, bouncing his own powers back at him. Enraged, Wolverine attempts to charge, only for the left half of his body to be incinerated by Genocide. Famine then beats his drums and subdues Deadpool. Only Psylocke puts up the best fight, while Archangel orders his servants not to harm her. Deadpool then throws a smoke grenade to cover their escape but Psylocke chooses to stay behind, refusing to give up on Archangel.\nOnce they are far away from Cavern X, E.V.A. determines that Genocide's attack has threatened to overload Wolverine's healing factor. Deathlok, having fallen in safeguarding The World, tells X-Force that unless they act now, countless innocents will die. Deadpool points out that they can't go and call on the Avengers without revealing X-Force's continued existence. He then defaults de facto command to Fantomex to figure out how to rectify all this.\nIn Akkaba Metropolis, Psylocke tries reaching out to Archangel, trying to get through to the Warren Worthington inside but to no avail. Archangel explains his plans to rectify mutantkind's situation. Because of M-Day, he plans on \"resetting\" evolution. He then takes Genocide to a prairie town to destroy it entirely."

Huber watches the X-Factor Investigations building. Nicole spots him out the building and smiles at him. Rictor cries to himself about not having any powers, but cheers up once Rahne sleeps with him.\nThe next day, Val Cooper offers Guido a new job as sheriff of Mutant Town.

Beast tells the guides to go back, then says that White Tiger, Snow-Queen's sister, a former super hero, would never have threatened to kill unarmed bystanders.\nEnraged by the insult, Snow Queen rushes to attack him, and the two struggle in the snow, before a hologram of the High Evolutionary interrupts them to say to bring Beast inside for a meeting.\nIn the workshop, Beast asks for help saving the mutant race from extinction. High Evolutionary says that extinction has a place in the natural process, from disease or changing climate or asteroids. Beast snaps back that Scarlet Witch is not an impersonal disaster, but a mortal woman, suffering from a personal tragedy and gifted with too much power. Beast reaches out to the High Evolutionary's shoulder... and finds only a hologram. High Evolutionary admits that he is busy elsewhere, and is teleconferencing as an effort to give Beast some closure. Beast's research will not result in success. Science cannot help him in this magical conundrum, and he is better served doing nothing that committing resources to sure failure... which is what the High Evolutionary told Beast's\"colleague\".\nBeast is curious who he is talking about, but High Evolutionary considers the meeting over, and his hologram vanishes.\nSnow Queen and her troop lead Beast back outside, and remind him that evolution and adaptation are core parts of the success of life. Everywhere he goes on Earth, he is treading ground where a species died..."

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nWeeks ago, a feverish dream. Gabriel \"Vulcan\" Summers, sleeping in the memory of the entities that found him in the Fault, and returned him to the world, seemingly untouched by the experience, but with a secret to come. When he wakes, his family and friends were waiting for him, with a shocking revelation.\nHis two friends, Petra & Sway, who had been living with the family in the Summers House on the Moon, were merely constructs, projected by the power of Vulcan. But, with advances in Krakoa's resurrection technology, now they could be truly revived. Refusing to accept this, Vulcan destroyed the house.\nIn the present day, Vulcan is in custody on the Keep, the S.W.O.R.D. space station orbiting Planet Arakko. He is accosted by Abigail Brand, director of S.W.O.R.D., who laid out her case - Vulcan is a toxic mix of irrepressible energy and unreliable motivation. He fights with his family on the Moon, he will not live on Krakoa, and so he is picking fights with diplomats on Arakko. Brand thinks he needs an outlet, and so she has recruited him to her new project - X-Men Red, an order enforcement agency for the red planet.\nVulcan is dismissive, which makes another recruit, Manifold, quit. He already had issues with Brand's plan for the team, which smacked of paternalism to him. He cannot trust such an unstable man as Vulcan, and thinks Brand would have to be a fool to trust him... and Brand is no fool. Making a cryptic reference to the recently-deceased HP Gyrich, whose death benefited Brand greatly, Manifold departs. Brand asks the rest of the group if they would disagree with a \"hypothetical\" policy of murdering her political enemies, and to a chorus of silence, X-Men Red departs on their first mission - to save the settlement of the Morrowlands from a pair of space monsters.\nThe Morrowlands is a commune of artists, seeking a path to recover from the traumatic memories of the prisons of Amenth. The monsters are unknown to them... but the suddenly-arriving X-Men Red identify them as Progenitors, a class of ancient computer mind that perpetrate science on smaller lifeforms, of a kind last seen fighting the Guardians of the Galaxy. Cable tries to frontally assault one, and has his techno-organic arm stolen away before getting burnt alive.\nAs X-Men Red freeze in shock, a Morrowlander artist named Oris Light-Shaper throws a hologram at a Progenitor and is similarly immolated. While Frenzy understands that the Arakkii never see themselves as innocents to be saved, Brand overrules her and tells the team to get the\"civilians\"to move back, in a standard police action.\nVulcan, his arrogance visible, is the worst possible man for the job... but he is swiftly overruled by the arrival of Storm and her team, the Brotherhood of Arakko. Onlookers recognise her - and also the Arakkii among them, who they call the \"weaponless king\". Fisher King dismisses this as mere tales, but when Magneto announces that he can decapitate the Progenitors if someone can distract the creatures, Fisher King uses his reputation, calling on the Morrowlander artists to generate sights and sounds to dazzle the interlopers, to give their comrades an opening. With squared shoulders, the artist collective lobs songs and holograms at the aliens, vowing to break the beasts with beauty.\nGrinning, Magneto is able to send the heads of the shocked Progenitors flying into space. But this moment of victory is interrupted by Vulcan, who sees the success of the Brotherhood as a personal affront. He is interrupted by Storm, who opposes his power with her own. As the power tenses around them, Storm explains why she is going to win - although they are both omega-level mutants, he has spent his whole career fighting against foes weaker than himself, why she... hasn't. Exhausted by the fight, Vulcan passes out.\nIn her diary afterwards, Abigail Brand admits that the day was a mix of success and failure. By using her hireling, Orbis Stellaris, to deploy the Progenitors, she was able to secure one goal - stealing data on Cable's techno-organic arm to give to Orchis. Orchis, who she plans to betray, and who will not see her coming, because they are led by technologists, not political thinkers. Her second goal, to present X-Men Red as heroes while using them as a dull hammer to drive a wedge between Krakoa & Arakko, to drive the Arakkii back to Amenth so that she can make use of the planet they leave behind, failed, because Storm's Brotherhood are so much better at the public goal of her team that they render it redundant.\nBrand thought of Storm as a pawn to be played and discarded, but Storm has persevered in her role, and made her own moves. And so she must be opposed. And so Brand needs an agent on the Great Ring of Arakko.\nAnd so Abigail Brand goes to Vulcan, and tells him that to be seen as the biggest hero, he must kill and depose the biggest villain - Tarn the Uncaring, who sits on the Great Ring...\nWHO CAN TAME THE RED PLANET?\nThe mutants of Mars spent millennia worshipping war — and on what they now call Arakko, they’re keeping up their violent ways. ABIGAIL BRAND knows the red planet needs a firm ruler in charge. But STORM has other ideas, along with a broken MAGNETO in her corner and ROBERTO DA COSTA making his own moves."

He explains that he had been inDoverto interviewWiccanwhen theHoodattacked, warped by evil magic into a monstrous creature with gaping jaws.  He put his guns to Strange's head and demanded theEye of Agamotto, but Strange refused, saying he had to earn it. When he tried to persuade the Hood that the demon empowering him will never keep its promises, the Hood became enraged and assaulted him with magic. Strange managed to avoid becoming overwhelmed, but he needed help to escape: which he got from Wiccan, who had gone up to a rooftop and cast a lightning bolt at the Hood.  Strange explains that he managed to teleport Billy safely away, and get himself to the New Avengers, but that had taken the last of his strength.\nThe Hood was seeking the Eye of Agamotto, which Strange has in his possession but is no longer wearing.  He says it is his duty to find the next Sorcerer Supreme; his own failures disqualify him from taking back that role.  The New Avengers, who are also seeking the Hood, volunteer to accompany Strange -- he demurs at first, but they insist on helping him as he helped them, and because he is their friend.\nAt his penthouse, Parker Robbins is in pain and begsDormammuto make it stop, saying he can't do it any more. All he receives in reply is a demonic face appearing in his mirror, and another jolt of evil magic.Madame Masquefinds him on the floor; in his distraction Robbins barely remembers that he asked her to come.  She tries to persuade him to get help, to go see Doctor Strange; as proof of her sincerity she removes her mask, revealing her scarred face. The Hood says \"Wow,\" and they fall into a passionate embrace, but, behind them, Dormammu's face once again appears in the mirror.\nThe New Avengers head toNew Orleansin aQuinjetwhichMs. Marvel\"borrowed\" from theMighty Avengers. Doctor Strange explains that the Eye can give him an indication of the right place to look but no more than that.Mockingbirdasks whether someone like the Hood orDoctor Doomcould be the candidate, which a troubled Strange admits could be the case.Luke Cagesuddenly exclaims that, if the Eye has led them to New Orleans, he knows exactly who they need to see.\nIn his apartment on Bourbon Street,Daimon Hellstromis on the phone to his ex-wifePatsy Walker, angrily pleading with her to come back and admitting that he's worried about her.  Just then, he hears someone outside the door -- the Hood, eyes and guns blazing, has arrived to strike him down."

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nEvents:\nKelvin Heng was a child prodigy who graduated MIT summa cum laude at age thirteen. When he turned fifteen, his first IPO made a hundred million dollars on day one, but his parents shorted him out of the money and disappeared. Kelvin returned five years later as the CEO of Feilong Industries, and his second IPO promised planet-size innovations in biology and climate science. He later turned a lifeless desert green, and sought to achieve his dream of doing the same to Mars. This dream was crushed, however, when the citizens of Krakoa did it first. After augmenting his body to survive on Mars, he swore Krakoa would pay for the theft of his dream.\nSeemingly overnight, the Treehouse, the new base of the X-Men, was constructed in the southwest corner of the 86th Street Central Park Transverse. Ben Urich, a reporter for the Daily Bugle, comes up to Cyclops to ask a few questions about Krakoa and mutants. Before Cyclops can answer a question about Jumbo Carnation, he leaves.\nCyclops shows Polaris around the Treehouse, but as they finish, Marvel Girl recognizes a telepathic wave of excitement from people in the city seeing a fireball in the sky. Rogue flies alongside the fireball to see what it is, but it crashes to the ground in front of her, growing into a building-sized organic robot. It throws Rogue through a set of buildings, so the other six X-Men jump in to defeat the monster. Rogue saves Polaris from getting hit by it, and Polaris says she owes her. Polaris then shields everyone from an energy wave that gives everyone in the tristate area a migraine. The seven heroes come up with a plan.\nPolaris builds a giant robot mech to match the strength of the organic robot creature, and Sunfire powers it from the center with his fire. They don’t hold back, but are blasted with energy. Wolverine takes this as an opportunity to strike, and leaps into the organic robot, slashing its insides and defeating it for good. The Avengers and Fantastic Four show up and congratulate the X-Men on a job well done. Synch remarks that being cheered for is going to be difficult to get used to. They later find that the robot’s only purposes were to psionically destroy mammalian brains and to replicate itself using whatever they had on Earth. Marvel Girl tells everyone to be ready for the next attack.\nMeanwhile on Gameworld, an alien loses a bet on the organic robot. The host of this event, Cordyceps Jones, tells everyone to keep betting on Earthlings being destroyed, but the planet itself is supposed to be preserved.\nThen back on Earth, Dr. Stasis is experimenting on someone to achieve immortality. He wonders how the mutants are resurrecting their dead.\nTHESE X-MEN ARE... FEARLESS!\nThe heroes of Krakoa are here to save the planet!\nThings might be complicated between the nation of Krakoa and the rest of the world, but to the X-MEN, things are simple — you do what’s right, you protect those who need protecting and you save the world we all share. Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Sunfire, Rogue, Wolverine, Synch and Polaris are the chosen champions of mutantkind, and they will not shrink from any battle for their home planet."

They refuse, and Kl'rt attempts to rescue Teddy himself, insisting that the only way to protect the Earth is for Teddy to take up the Skrull throne and lead the war against the Kree. Teddy formulates a plan of his own, and offers to spend six Earth-months with each culture, while making regular visits back to Earth, before deciding who to swear his allegiance to. Teddy says his goodbyes to the team, and leaves with the Skrull.\nMoments later, however, Wolverine reveals that \"Teddy\" is actually the Super-Skrull in diguise, while the \"Super-Skrull\" still on Earth with the Avengers is actually Teddy in disguise.

He then disguises himself as Tony Stark to get her off of Camp Hammond, so he could have a private chat with her at a nearby diner, unaware that they are under surveillance by AIM. Cassie becomes uncomfortable that he's looking like Stark, so he changes appearance to Iron Lad, which she finds a little offensive. Vision then goes on to explain that after the Superhuman Civil War, he went around the world trying to find himself. After many disguises and quests, including a search for Wanda Maximoff, he realized that as a hybrid of the original Vision and Iron Lad, he is completely different person. That is why he chose his side in the war, because the original Vision and Iron Lad would've made different choices. He then rejects her offer to join the Initiative, for he really wanted to see how distant she was from the other heroes. Cassie presumes that he's here to recruit for the anti-registration side. She then launches into a lecture over how refusing to register results in trouble.\nHowever, their little date is interrupted by AIM, who fire an energy weapon at him. Cassie attempts to stand up in her teammate's defense, only for him to accidentally phase his hand through her chest as it solidified, preventing her from changing size. The beekeepers then demand that either they both come quietly, or they'll take the android from Cassie's corpse. But the Young Avengers are able to fight them off. The beekeepers the flee, knowing that Cape-Killers are going to flood the place any minute. Vision, asking that he'd be called Jonas, asks Cassie if she's going to turn him in, to which she replies no. With the Vision camouflaging with his surrounding, Cassie is able to bluff to the Cape-Killers that AIM was after her. She then walked to a hidden area, where she is able to grow to a size at which the Vision could free himself. They then resumed their conversation on a barnhouse roof, where the Vision tells Cassie that though he may have Iron Lad's brain patterns, he's a completely different person who shares his feelings for her. They share a kiss, before Cassie states that she wants some time to think about this."

He has also created three new synthezoids: a wife, Virginia, and two twin children, son Vin and daughter Viv. Like most people in his neighborhood, Vision now works for the government, being the President’s direct liaison for the Avengers.\nShortly after Vision’s new family moves into the neighborhood, two snobbish neighbors - a middle-aged couple, the Knowles, consisting of mortgage broker George and HR worker Nora - decide to give them cookies as a housewarming present. As the Knowles’ bicker over whether or not they can even eat cookies, the Visions’ welcome them in and give them a tour of the house, which features gifts from Black Panther, the Silver Surfer, Steve Rogers, and Scarlet Witch. As the Knowles’ eventually leave so Vision can go to work, the narrator notes that by the end, one of the Vision’s will set the Knowles’ house on fire and kill them.\nVirginia throws the cookies away while she and Vision debate on whether or not it is grammatically correct to say that the Knowles’ were “kind” or “nice”. It eventually devolves into Virginia saying that the human ideal of a home life is meaningless, but Vision asserts that choosing one’s own path frivolously is more humane than living by a set of logical rules the way Ultron would have. Virginia then agrees with him.\nTime passes, and the new family begins acclimating to their new life. Vin and Viv become popular with children, and happily entertain them with their powers. Older neighbors treat the family like celebrities and take pictures of or with them. Vision begins his new job, but dislikes the fact that it is unpaid, while Virginia struggles to think of what career she herself would pursue. Virginia also spends time searching her own mind for latent memories, while Vin and Viv download information from the outside world constantly.\nEventually, Vin and Viv’s first day at high school arrives. Wearing casual human clothes, Vin and Viv fly over to school, where the other students become shocked at their presence. Once they are gone, Virginia questions why her children must leave the safety of their home, to which Vision replies that, as Viv and Vin’s minds are underdeveloped, they need education to become properly equipped for the world; he then receives a call from Captain America. Meanwhile, Vin attends his first class, when a girl behind him beckons for him. As Vin attempts to say that they aren’t allowed to talk in class, the girl shows him a note on her computer asking him “R U NORMAL?”. Vin appears mortified by the question.\nOnce school ends, Vin asks Viv if he is normal, but she can only reply that their father wants them to be as normal as possible. Later that night, Vision and Virginia are “sleeping” when suddenly the former awakes in a fright, remembering the time Virginia first opened her eyes, and how her blinking made him think she had a glitch. His thoughts inevitably go back to Wanda, where it is revealed that Virginia was made from the brainwaves of his memories of his previous wife. However, he then attempts to purge these lingering feelings in order to be devoted to his current wife.\nOn that Saturday, Vision decides to leave to run self-diagnostics at Avengers HQ. While waiting for him to come back for dinner, Virginia decides to review her children’s schoolwork with them in order to learn what they are learning. As she criticizes one of Viv’s answers, Viv begins to leave in a huff, only for a scythe to burst through the wall, impaling Viv through the back and out through her stomach.\nThe attacker is revealed to be the Grim Reaper, who believes that the new family are perverted clones of his brother Wonder Man and seeks to exterminate them. Bursting through the home, he tries to attack Vin, but Virginia comes from behind and bashes the Grim Reaper’s head in with the Knowles’ cookie tray. She then begins to keep hitting him in the head until Vin finally gets her to stop, but not before they both realize that the Grim Reaper is already dead. As Virginia and Vin stand over his body while a malfunctioning Viv lies in a corner, Virginia tells her children not to tell Vision what happened."

After his endorsement, the Avengers unanimously vote to test Spider-Man, and if he passes, to accept him. Each Avenger takes off to find Spider-Man.Thoris the first to find him, and gives him 24 hours to show to the Avengers headquarters. Pete wrestles with the idea of being on a team in the public eye versus being self-employed and calling the shots himself.\nFinally, he decides to take a chance and meet the Avengers. As he arrives, the Avengers are bogged down as to what test they should give Spider-Man.Iron Mantells him to get out of the way as they figure out what they want to do. Spider-Man takes great offense and figures that riling him up is the test so Spider-Man begins to fight the Avengers. Instead, they decide to have Spider-Man bringHulkto them but Spider-Man leaves before they can explain why. As he stops atThe Daily Buglefor refreshment,Frederick FoswelltellsJ. Jonah Jamesonthat the Hulk has been spotted at a gamma ray research center. While fighting the Hulk, he punches and a gamma ray explodes temporarily turning him back into Bruce Banner.\nSpider-Man tries to explain his purpose there, but ends up wondering why the Avengers want a sick man, not an evil villain. He lets Hulk go and tells the Avengers he couldn’t be found. The Avengers didn’t tell Spider-Man that they wanted to help him, but Spider-Man feared he would lead Hulk to his doom. Pete, conflicted by the result, tries to tell himself it’s for the best.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nAs it turns out, Betty's trouble involves her brother Bennett, who is the lawyer for crime boss Blackie Gaxton. He also owes Gaxton a large gambling debt. In order to clear this debt, Betty has agreed to help Bennett follow through with Gaxton's plan: Use Dr. Octopus to free him from prison.\nWhen Peter travels to Philadelphia, he tracks down Betty and tells her how he feels. Meanwhile, Dr. Octopus frees Gaxton, and they take Betty and Bennett as hostages as they escape by boat. Spider-Man arrives to capture both, but during the altercation Spider-Man sprains his ankle and Bennett is shot by a bullet fired by Blackie that was meant for his sister.\nBetty blames Spider-Man for her brother's death, and Spider-Man battles Dr. Octopus around the ship, but Octopus escapes. The police arrive and arrest Blackie and his gang. Later, having changed back to Peter Parker, he learns from Betty that she hopes to never see Spider-Man again, because she couldn't bear being reminded of her brother's death. This hampers Peter's plans of revealing his secret identity to her.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nWith his spider-powers seemingly gone because he's come down with a cold, Peter decides that he has no choice but to save Betty as he is, and so he accepts the challenge. When he tells Jameson (pretending that he just heard it, so his identity isn't compromised), Jameson reports the story himself.\nWhen Spider-Man arrives to battle Dr. Octopus, all his powers have completely faded. Naturally, the powerless Spider-Man proves to be no match for Dr. Octopus. Dr. Octopus publicly unmasks Spider-Man. Octopus theorizes that Parker was simply posing as Spider-Man to save his girlfriend, because Spider-Man would put up a better fight. He flees the scene to find some other way to get the \"real\" Spider-Man's attention.\nEveryone gives Peter grief for the danger he put himself in; however, Liz Allan finds the whole episode romantic, and her opinion of Peter changes and she realizes that she's attracted to him. The next day, Peter finds that the cold has passed and as a result, his powers are back. When Dr. Octopus releases animals from the zoo, Peter goes into action as Spider-Man. He rounds up all the animals, and gets into a fight with Dr. Octopus across the city."

After a double sword slash to his neck almost breaches his suit, Tony shape-shifts his suit into a samurai-esque armor for extra protection, and manages to counteract one of the ninja's attacks and disarm him, gaining his sword. Tony uses an energy bubble blast to knock his opponents back, and decides to test a theory. After hurling one of the ninja to the water, causing his suit to short out, the other ninja are all affected. Tony takes advantage of this opportunity, and knocks them all out one by one. Similarly to theMandroid Armor, the suits were cybernetically connected, so if one of them backfired, the rest needed a second to reconnect.\nIron Man starts interrogating one of the ninja, who's speaking Chinese, but before he can get any information from them, a failsafe is activated in their suits, and they all are electrocuted and fried to death. While the local authorities arrive and he informs them of the events, Iron Man scans the scene and leaves.\nIn theStark Tower, Tony is trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle, but he's alerted by Friday that he has an appointment, a visit toSt. Jude's Hospital.

One kid in particular, namedMax, appears disgruntled because Tony isn't wearing his armor. Tony claims that he didn't bring his armor... but several of them instead. Numerous of his suits then enter the room and start greeting the kids, bringing joy to the children. Tony even shape-shifts his most recent armor into a smaller configuration for Max to wear. Tony is still connected to Friday, who informs him that there are no sightings ofMadame Masque, the ninja, nor Doctor Doom. In that very same moment, Tony catches a glimpse atVictor, who's eating potato chips next to the door. Tony is alerted by his presence, and points his armors at him, and orders von Doom to go to the rooftop to question him.\nInChicago,Mary Jane Watsonis hosting the opening of her newest nightclub,Jackpot, which she had opened afterMJ'sgot destroyed during a super hero battle.

Unfortunately, due to his injuries the Professor cannot, and due to the limitations on his mental powers and the amount of minds in the room he is unable to pinpoint who is plotting to murder him and decides to get the X-Men involved to try and prevent the attack.\nMeanwhile, in the African Serengeti, Storm is enjoying the wilderness when she is approached by a lion. Seeing this as a sign she is horrified when the creature is shot dead. When she rushes to it she is grazed by a bullet. This is a shot fired by Andreas von Strucker, who is paying Ororo back for beating her and her brother up earlier and they decide to leave her for dead in the wilderness.\nBack in New York City, Professor X meets with his fellow X-Men and Magneto at a deli where he explains the plot against him by the students who beat him earlier. As they begin planning, Rachel becomes distracted when she notices a strange man suddenly entering the deli and asking strange questions about \"manners\" and satisfying his curiosity about food. Rachel approaches the man and realizes that it's the Beyonder. But when Kitty goes up to see who she is talking to and Rachel tries to point him out the Beyonder has vanished just as mysteriously as he entered, leaving both wondering what the Beyonder wanted. Nightcrawler is paying a visit to his priest father Bowen at St. Anne's church. He explains his encounter with the Beyonder, a being that has shaken his faith in God. Breaking down into tears before the troubled priest, Nightcrawler admits that he has lost.\nThat night at Columbia University, the students plotting to kill Xavier plants a special device on Xavier's desk that will kill him the moment he sits down at it. While nearby, the X-Men stake out the area looking for clues. As Rogue carries Rachel over the campus she talks about how she can trust Magneto to work with the X-Men considering that in her reality, Magneto was a trusted ally of the surviving X-Men. The conversation ends when Rachel picks up trouble in an alley and the two help stop a mugging. However, it proves to be a bitter victory as the man they saved was jumped while writing an anti-mutant epitaph on the wall. Angry that this sort of anti-mutant sentiment is being allowed, Rachel angrily psi-blasts the wall and vows never to let her apocalyptic future to happen again. As she and Rogue walk away, neither are aware that they were being watched by the Beyonder who has found Rachel's actions very interesting and decide to observe her farther.\nElsewhere, Kitty and Wolverine go over reports back from the others when Kitty's curiosity in Wolverine's cigar makes her yank it out of his mouth and give it a puff. She finds the smoke incredibly harsh and proceeds to have a coughing fit. Wolverine finds this amusing and tells he that the only reason he can handle the cigars without any irritation is because of his mutant healing factor. They then begin talking about if they should be able to trust Magneto, to which Logan suggests that Magneto deserves a chance at redemption.\nKitty then decides to check out their next list of suspects and uses her phasing powers to gain access to a dormitory, unaware that the Beyonder is secretly watching her. She enters a physics lab where she comes across her classmate Roger and some other students working on something in secret. She decides to butt in and start asking questions. Roger, knowing that Kitty attends Xavier's school, asks her if she is a Mutie. When she retorts by asking him if he identifies as a racial slur, he becomes angry and she points out that calling a mutant a Mutie is no different or any less hurtful. When she decides to leave she is maced and chloroformed and Roger decides that she has to die as well. Her attempts to contact Rachel or the Professor telepathically but it's too late. While the other X-Men are waiting for Kitty, Rachel accompanies Xavier and Magneto back to Charles' office. She is expressing her concerns over the Beyonder when she detects his presence when they enter the office. Using her psi-powers to try and get them to see him to, Rachel inadvertently activates the weapon left behind by the students, a psi scrambler device that bombards her mind and threatens to overload it. The resulting blast sends Charles and Magnus flying out of the building.\nWhile the other X-Men rescue them, Wolverine goes up to check on Rachel. Rachel, so furious about being attacked in such a horrible way manifests her hound costume and facial tattoos and races off to find the men responsible. She crashes in on Roger as he is attempting to choke Kitty to death. She knocks all the students aside and when Roger attempts to shoot her with a gun, she uses her telekinetic powers to turn the bullet back. It almost strikes Roger if not for Magneto's timely arrival.\nHe argues with her that this is not the way to deal with those whose ignorance and hate lead them to treat mutants as they do. He explains that the way of violence has done nothing for him over the years. Rachel counter argues that in the future she came from humans made her into a slave-hound and killed all those she loved. When she expresses that they need to pay for the pain and the suffering they have caused, Magneto decides to let her make up her mind. Telling her that she should slaughter them as mercilessly and callously as they would her. Rachel finds that she cannot take a human life and spares Roger, telling Magneto that she may never be able to forgive him for this and suggests that they leave. As they walk away, Kitty thanks Rachel for her help.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the Beyonder finds the whole tableau that happened before him strange and confusing. Wondering why beings of such power would act in the fashion that they did. Finding the X-Men puzzling indeed, the Beyonder decides to turn his attention to others and teleports away.[2]\nSecret Wars II continues inIron Man#197..."

Of course, it wasn’t the best time to review them.  As a lower agent refuses to fire onCaptain America, the Widow shoots him in the head and begins firing at theAvengers, and the rest of the agents follow suit.\nAs Cap yells for no casualties, mainly forWolverine’ssake, Spider-Woman flies him towards the Window.  Claws stretched outward, they would have killed the her if not forCap’s shieldslamming into the back of his neck.  Even at low power, Iron Man activates a polar magnetic field which causes all metallic objects to float towards him, including keys, guns, and Wolverine.  Seeing they were unarmed and very much outmatched, the agents flee the scene.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. says that they have no presence in theSavage Landand the Black Widow, a freelance S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, is not supposed to be in the Savage Land.  Considering she and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents just tried to kill them in the Savage Land, Spider-Woman asked her whose orders she was following and what they were doing in the Savage Land.  The Widow kept her mouth shut.  Spider-Woman goes on to inform her that she has a license to kill and demanded a name.  The Widow responds, “I work for the same people you work for.”  Before they could interrogate her further,Sauron’scorpse jumps up and breathes fire on the Widow.\nIron Man andCageare able to knock Sauron out and he transforms back into Lykos.  He apparently absorbed some of Wolverine’s healing factor when he transformed; that kept him alive.  They decide to hunt down the rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and get a ride back to civilization when Iron Man detects strange readings in the distance.  Those readings are the remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents doing what they came to the Savage Land to do; enslave the native inhabitants and force them to mineVibranium.\nThe Avengers charge into battle as multiple energy blasts fall from the sky, decimating the entire installation.  Only Iron Man’s repulsor field saved them from utter destruction. The source of the blasts; theS.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.Agent Hill, the S.H.I.E.L.D. director, claimed that their own investigation into the Raft breakout led them to the Savage Land and that the destruction of the mining installation “was the appropriate response.”  As for who was behind it all, they merely said the investigation was ongoing.  She says the helicarrier would fly them back toNew Yorkand thanks them on behalf of theWeapon Xdirector for retrieving Sauron.  But, “For the record, we did ask you to stand down.  You ignored us.”\nWhen they are alone, Iron Man tells the team that there’s another problem.  The S.H.I.E.L.D. files given to them about the Raft had been tampered with, so he compared them with the files from the old Avengers database.  Over a dozen of the prisoners had been declared legally dead, yet still imprisoned.  This meant that S.H.I.E.L.D. was not only stockpiling super-weapons, they were stockpiling super-villains.    Whoever is behind it knows the Avengers are onto them, but the Avengers don’t know who they are.  Even if they do nothing, the real bad guys know they know something.  Cap offers anyone the option of backing out of the Avengers now, if they feel they can’t handle it.  Tony then offers a spot to Wolverine, which makes Cap want a private word.\nIRON MAN: Cap, you said this team came together by … fate.  Your word.  Just like the original Avengers, right? Yes.  Well the original Avengers didn’t truly come together until that one last ingredient came into the mix.  We needed that one last ingredient.  And then when we found you … you were that one thing.  But for this team, for this situation, for this world … he is you.  He is our missing ingredient.\nCAPTAIN AMERICA: Tony, he’s a murderer.\nIM: He’s a samurai warrior.  After what happened toWanda, after what we know happened here today, we can’t afford not to have him.  We’re going to need someone to go to that place that we can’t.  And you know exactly what I mean.\nCap reluctantly agrees to allow Logan a spot on the team\nIn a hidden location, the Black Widow lies in a hospital bed.  She is horribly scarred by Sauron’s attack.  Her employer offers her a chance to reap vengeance on the Avengers for what they had done to her, and she agrees."

As the Surfer travels along it, he realizes that the damage caused to the Earth will soon lead to the planet's eventual destruction. He is soon joined by Captain Marvel of the Avengers, who has come to ask the Surfer if he can help them try to repair the damage. The Surfer agrees and as they head back to the location where the final battle took place, Captain Marvel explains to the Surfer who the Beyonder is. She explains that months earlier the Beyonder captured an army of heroes and villains to Battleworld to take part in a Secret War to learn about this universe[1]. After the battle ended, the Beyonder had come to Earth[2]to learn what it was to desire. After taking the form of Captain America[3], he began interacting with the people of Earth. However, the Avengers experiences with the Beyonder were always more trouble with help, and the Wasp's attempt to recruit the Beyonder into the Avengers was rejected[4].\nWhen the Beyonder failed at being a religious guru, he became violent[5]and attempted to destroy the Earth, which the heroes thwarted.[6]Captain Marvel explains that after most of the other heroes left or were sent home leaving the Avengers to clean up. It wasn't until then that the full scope of the damage done to the Earth was realized. As the Avengers went for cover during a massive earthquake, the Black Knight dislocated his shoulder and Namor almost perished when falling into the lava below before he was saved by Mr. Fantastic, who realizing the scope of the damage done to the Earth, returned with the Fantastic Four to help. With her story complete the two heroes near the camp and the Surfer faintly detects a familiar energy source.\nAt a refugee site where the military is treating those injured in the battle, the Molecule Man is in a coma, which baffles doctors who cannot learn the source and begin asking too many questions, worrying his girlfriend Marsha Rosenberg. While at ground zero, Mr. Fantastic scans the location with a quickly constructed Geo-Stress Analyzer and is surprised to find that the time until the Earth's destruction has gone from 1 hour to 6. While this is welcome news, Reed is still unsure how to save the Earth. With no plans to save the Earth, Hercules -- frustrated that none of their combined powers can save the Earth -- loses his temper and blows steam by throwing a large rock.\nWhen the Surfer arrives with Captain Marvel, Reed Richards asks him if his Power Cosmic could be enough to save the Earth. The Surfer is unsure but is willing to give it a try in order to save his adopted world. Utilizing his full powers, the Surfer attempts to gather back the dissipated molecules of the Earth's crust but finds that the effort requires more power than even he has and collapses. When deciding what to do next, Captain America realizes that there might be someone who may have the power to save the Earth. He recalls how during the final battle against he Beyonder, the Molecule Man not only went up against the Beyonder alone, but also used his powers to save the heroes from the blast that damaged the Earth, and teleport all living things out of the blast zone and store them into sub-space until the damage could be repaired[6]. Realizing that the Molecule Man might be their salvation, they begin deciding how to find him.\nWhen the Surfer realizes that the Molecule Man's energies where what he detected earlier, he takes the Wasp and Captain Marvel with him to track Owen down. Meanwhile, the military doctors make Marsha too worried about Owen's safety. When Owen revives he uses a little of his powers to help them escape, turning the tent into a makeshift hot-air balloon that Marsha causes to raise using her Volcana powers. As they float away, they are confronted by a hologram of Captain Marvel. Panicking as she recalled Captain Marvel's attack on Owen during the previous Secret War[7]Marsha attacks destroying the hologram. When Captain Marvel reports back to the Surfer and Wasp, the Surfer tells the women to return to base while he comes up with another way to get Volcana and the Molecule Man to come to them. Flying up into Earth's atmosphere, the Surfer uses his powers to manipulate the jet stream to carry Owen and Marsha to the heroes camp.\nWhen they arrive, Marsha attempts to defend Owen, however when she realizes she faces impossible odds she decides to listen to the heroes' appeal to get them to help. After some debate, Owen decides to help save the Earth, even if the exertion required may kill him or completely burn out his power -- his original idea to save only himself and Marsha being too big a price and too difficult to adapt to. However, he tells the heroes that he has been using his powers to try and repair the damage and has only succeeded in delaying the inevitable. The Surfer, however, offers to combine his powers to augment the Molecule Man's natural abilities. Owen agrees to do this and trusts in the Surfer not to take control of him or wipe out his powers after he is done. The two combine their powers and repair all the damage. In the aftermath, it appears that Owen has lost his powers. The heroes are grateful for the former Molecule Man's help and agree not to inform the government of his involvement and have the Surfer fly Owen and Marsha back to their home in Denver.\nThere Marsha is surprised that their apartment had been repaired of all the damage caused to it[6]. Owen explains that while he and the Surfer were repairing the damage done to the Earth, he also returned those placed in sub-space and repaired some of the other damage done by the Beyonder: Such as repairing the damage done to San Francisco[8]and restoring the X-Mansion[9]. To Marsha's surprise, she learns that the Surfer didn't force Owen to do anything, and that his powers weren't removed after all, that it was a ruse played on the heroes so that they would leave the couple to live anonymously. Owen thanks the Surfer for playing along with the ruse, to which the Surfer commends Owen for his bravery, and their ability to mutually trust each other. That if he were to fear the Molecule Man, then he would have been the one causing evil. With the couple happily reunited in their idealistic world, the Surfer bids them farewell and flies off into the night sky, envying them for the happiness they have together, hoping that one day all who live can find the same happiness."

Then Jessica looks up to seeAtlaswreckingAvengers Tower.\nThe Avengers,Secret Avengers, and those New Avengers who are able to fight rush to the scene, but they find the damage minimal and the building empty. Atlas' attack was merely a decoy to give Williams time to call a press conference. When the Avengers arrive, they find him holding forth on the steps of theNew York Public Library, telling a large crowd that the Avengers have been operating in secret for too long and must be held to account. He threatens to make all their crimes public unless they disband. The Avengers order him to stand down, but he is defiant: \"I don't acknowledge your authority over me!... You'll kill me to cover up the truth! You'll let these people burn to protect our secrets.\"\nIron Man tries to talk Williams down, but when that fails he releases a sphere from a hidden compartment in his armor, trapping Williams' ionic form within. The rest of the Revengers are given the option to surrender; Atlas refuses, gambling that the Avengers won't dare to attack with so many civilians around. They are right: the Avengers teleported them to an empty Citi Field instead, where the combined forces of all three teams make short work of their opponents.\nIn custody, the Revengers share their grievances. Their reasons vary from vengeance (Goliath,Ethan Edwards) to wounded pride (Captain Ultra,Devil-Slayer, Atlas) to a simple conviction that Williams is in the right and the Avengers are in the wrong (Anti-Venom).\nBeast, who has seemed the most hurt and mystified by Williams' behavior, goes to interview him while Rogers, Iron Man, and Thor watch by video feed. Williams insists that he is acting of his own free will and remains steadfast in his claim that the Avengers must disband before more people are hurt. He also adds something new: his realization thatWanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, created him; that he probably isn't even real. Appealing to their friendship, Williams tries to extract a promise from Beast to shut the Avengers down when he realizes that Williams is in the right, but a distressed Beast walks away.\nVarious news programs and talking heads are buzzing about the Avengers' lack of transparency and stonewalling tactics. Some openly speculate that the time for a self-appointed hero team is over and done.\nIn his bubble, Simon Williams smiles and vanishes into a white light.\n• Simon Williams and his Revengers believe the Avengers’ time is up and they’ve taken the fight right to the Avengers’ front door."

The abductees awaken in luxurious individual suites where they're greeted by members of the Coterie. The hosts explain that the heroes have been selected to compete in a contest, fighting each other in select matches, for the entertainment of their intergalactic audience. The ultimate victor will be awarded the full benefit of the Coterie's accumulated otherworldly knowledge, enough to grant anything the heart desires. There is no need to worry about the welfare of their opponents, as losers will be restored and returned home safely at the end of each match. In the downtime between matches, contestants get to enjoy the ship's ability to holographically manifest any dream scenario they want.\nMost of the contestants are quickly taken in by the offer, but for sinister reasons. What they don't see is that the ship's air is suffused with nanites that infect those brought aboard, making their minds more suggestible and content. The one exception is Iron Man, whose air-tight armor and analytical instruments give him the chance to examine the situation more critically. He sees through the Coterie's holographic façade, but can't tell what the nanites are meant for, and noticing that the contestants are all isolated from one another outside of battle, he opts to play along until he can learn more.\nUnfortunately, Iron Man's immunity doesn't go unnoticed by those running the contest, the Badoon Brother Royal and the mysterious Imperatrix. They make sure to fast-track him through the arena. He defeats Psylocke in the first match, but in his second he's pitted against all eight members of X-Force simultaneously. He adapts well to most of the team, but gets shut down quickly by Bedlam's electronic-disrupting powers."

Ultron explains his origins to the computer Quasimodo and then explains his desire to use an android against the Avengers and how he had gotten the location of the Torch's body from the Mad Thinker himself. Ultron then takes the Torch's body leaving Quasimodo behind to be found by the Silver Surfer.\nWhile back on Earth in Vietnam, Moondragon has arrived to greet the Avengers. The spectral form taking the shape of the late Swordsman explains to all present that Moondragon and Mantis were destined to live similar lives, and that one of them was to be the Celestial Madonna, Mantis being the first choice and Moondragon was the backup should Mantis prove to be unworthy of the title.\nBack in time, Vision learns that Ultron was unable to repair the Torch's body, and so sought out Phineas T. Horton to help repair the android. Horton, now a down on his luck TV repairman, was easily coerced into helping Ultron. However, once the Human Torch was rebuilt into the body which would be known as the Vision, Phineas sacrifices his life trying to stop Ultron, but ultimately fails. Fearing that the Torch's personality would be a cause for the Vision to revolt, Ultron then planned to use the brain patterns of Simon Williams (aka Wonder Man) to ensure that the Vision would comply with his orders.\nThis story is continued inGiant-Size Avengers#4..."

However, later Doc Samson takes Jennifer to visit Dr. Strange, who finds the source of her of the problems with her ability to transform back and forth between Jen and She-Hulk: An old hex placed on her by the Scarlet Witch which made people unaware that Jennifer Walters and She-Hulk were one and the same. In order to restore the control of her powers, Strange had to remove this Hex.\nThis plays against her, as she takes on representation for Justice and Rage, two surviving New Warriors who are seeking to have the website \"Destroy All Warriors\" that has been outing the secret identities of surviving members of the New Warriors, past and present, in the hopes of the reaction leading to their deaths. Before taking the trial to court, the same website outs Jennifer as the She-Hulk, forcing Jen to become her alter ego and represent Justice and Rage in court as She-Hulk.\nAs the trial goes from the taking down of the site to a forum for victims of the Stamford incident (putting Rage into a fit of anger that nobody recognizes that his fellow Warriors had died as well.) John Jameson is confronted by his superiors who tell him to make a choice about his relationship with She-Hulk because it effects the image of the military. John secretly meets with Captain America, who tells John to follow his feelings.\nMeanwhile, back in court, Iron Man is put on the stand and questioned about the validity of the SHRA, which She-Hulk questions the point of Stark revealing his identity as he has shown the capability to erase people's memories of his true identity in the past. After the trial, Stark gives She-Hulk a memory card with information on the owner and operator of the Destroy All Warriors website.\nJen and a number of other former members of the New Warriors, crash on the owner who turns out to be the former New Warrior known as Hindsight. When asking him why he created the website, Hindsight tells them that after the Stamford incident, he lost all faith in the Warriors and wanted nothing to do with their legacy and opened the website to destroy them. Just before an angry mob forming can attack all assembled, they mob is disbursed when John Jameson arrives in a ship. Upon arriving, John reveals that he has come not only to get Jennifer out of a pickle, but also to propose to her.\nCivil Warcontinues inBlack Panther(Vol. 4) #18...\nCIVIL WAR threatens the rights of every American super hero."

Jessica's boyfriend and father of her child,Luke Cage, leavesJanet van Dyne'sdesign studio where he was picking out a new costume. He runs down the street, after to follow Jessica to the hospital as quickly as possible. Though no longer an active member, Janet van Dyne summons theAvengersto help Jessica and locate Cage.\nMeanwhile, at theDaily BugleBen UrichapproachesJ. Jonah Jamesonwith hisD-Manstory. Jameson accuses Urich of this being another attempt at protectingDaredevil'ssecret identity, but listens as Urich explains that D-Man has been foiling robbery attempts at jewelry stores and pawn shops, but has been taking some jewelry items for himself. Jameson remembers that Jessica is with a current Avenger and asks where she is when he really has a need for her.\nSimultaneously, Jessica has gone into labor at the hospital and is inundated with questions about the nature of her abilities by hospital staff.\nUrich travels down to a nearby police station to talk to a Detective Davis. Davis reveals that D-Man's real name isDennis Dunphy, but is known locally as the homeless superhero, having been arrested for vagrancy a few months ago.\nAt the hospital, Jessica is informed that her doctor has been detained on Long Island and most likely won't get back in time to assist in her birth. Then the bigoted head of the hospital barges in saying that Jones has to get out of the hospital as they don't know if the unborn child will possess any superhuman powers or pose a threat to the other patients. Just as they get ready to roll her out the hospital door,Captain Americaand the rest of the Avengers arrive and put Jones aboard theirQuinjet, claiming that they will take her to the best doctor in town. Luke Cage finally arrives outside the hospital as the Quinjet is taking off, getting picked up in the process. The Avengers proceed to take Jones to theSanctum SanctorumofDoctor Strange.\nBen Urich next investigates one of the pawn shops that had a robbery stopped by D-Man. He explains to the shop owner that the hero that stopped the robbery was not Daredevil as he had believed, but rather D-Man. The owner states that that explains a lot as he sees the hero exiting the sewers through a manhole outside of his store at least once every couple of days. Urich then gets down into the sewer in search of his story."

Recent events, particularly the disastrous standoff with Magneto at the United Nations, have reduced the Avengers’ active membership to three members and Goliath has seemingly lost the ability to grow larger. The Wasp suggests they search for Hercules, as he has been MIA but never officially resigned from the team as Captain America, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch all have. They take off in a Quinjet following his trail to Greece. Each of the three disheartened Avengers secretly wonders if the team should simply disband.\nMeanwhile, the Titan known as Typhon has taken control of Olympus and banished Hercules to a limbo dimension. In this netherworld, Hercules finds his father Zeus and the other members of the ancient Greek pantheon, who have all having exiled there as well. (Zeus remarks on Hercules’s clean-shaven appearance with distaste.) Having only enough power to return one of them to Earth, Zeus sends Hercules whom he believes can vanquish Typhon.\nHaving grown restless ruling over an abandoned Olympus, Typhon has descended to the Mediterranean Sea below where he encounters U.S. naval ships. He attacks them to demonstrate his might and sinks a submarine. The Avengers arrive and oppose him but are seriously outmatched. At one point, Goliath is cornered and unable to grow. He is forced to shrink to Ant-Man size to narrowly elude the Titan’s blows.\nHercules arrives on the scene and combats Typhon one one one, ultimately defeating him. Hercules’s victory enables the Olympians to return from their exile. Typhon is dispatched to Tartarus (the lower depths of the Olympian underworld) while a once banished Hercules is welcomed back to Olympus. Hercules therefore resigns from the Avengers as well. Yet back in his immortal home, he thinks to himself of the pride and respect he has for his fellow Avengers.\nReturning to New York, the three remaining Avengers realize that there will still be menaces to confront and that the Avengers must remain active, even if it is only the three of them."

As they try to comfort him, one announces himself as Peter, but Alistaire calls him out as a liar. He knows he is Nigel Orpington-Smythe, the head of R.C.X and its base, Cloud 9. He continues, telling him he framed his sister. But Nigel shrugs it off as ancient history. Alistaire makes a grab form him, but he ducks away and presses a button on his belt. As a wall swings open, Alistaire is grabbed by a group of Warpies, who Nigel calls his Advocates. They are Aberdeen Angus, Mustard, Shrew, Salt and Celery. Nigel apologises for the names, saying that after having nearly 400 warpies in the Cloud 9 base, they ran out of names fast. Alistaire tells them that he has phoned Excalibur, who will come and shut the base down. But Nigel smiles, telling them that he wanted Excalibur to come to cloud 9 all along.\nOn the surface, Nightcrawler, Kitty and Cerise search through the ruins of St Oswald’s for any sign of an entrance into the base Alistaire told them of. Kitty suggests she should phase down to it, but Nightcrawler tells them to stick together, as they are few without Brian and Meggan, who are still on holiday. From the darkness, a voice emerges. As its owner emerges into the light, it calls itself Peanut, being shaped like one, and riding a mechanical, spiderlike device. As another of the Seraphim, a team of Warpies, emerges, catching Cerise off guard and knocking her unconscious, it names them as Weasel. It names the next member of the Seraphim that grabs Kitty Cyanide, as he temporarily stops her moving. Nightcrawler kicks a rock at Cyanide, but then he too is attacked by two large members of the Seraphim, Pumice and Cabbage. As he flails, his hand catches on peanut, who tells him his power is to break concentration, so he can’t teleport away. As Cabbage knocks out Nightcrawler, the Seraphim, gather up the heroes and take them into the Cloud 9 base. But as they enter, Nightcrawler opens his eyes, as he is only faking at being unconscious.\nIn space, drifting across a galaxy, The Phoenix Force struggle with the knowledge that they have become a parasite of life energy.\nInside Cloud 9, Nigel is taking Alistaire to meet Excalibur. As they walk, Nigel explains that it was built by the Warpies, who used their unique abilities to create the enormous underground complex. Alistaire sees Micromax, connected to a series of machine. Nigel tells him that he is undergoing tests on his abilities, abilities he believes have been wasted. Alistaire tells him that Micromax works for F.I.6, not R.C.X, and so shouldn’t be their concern. Nigel responds by announcing that with the deaths of Brigadier Blott and Alysdane Stuart, F.I.6 and W.H.O have been absorbed into R.C.X, and as such, Alistaire is now one of their employees. As Nigel tries to persuade Alistaire of the benefits of the facility, which is designed to contain and educate parahumans, they are forced aside by a medical team, who are sweeping one of the Warpies to the medical bay. He is Beetroot, a telepath, and as he looks into Alistaire’s eyes, Alistaire begins to see Beetroot’s memories.\nIn a house long ago, Alistaire sees Beetroot and his mother. Suddenly, 2 men arrive, and whisk Beetroot away to a large building with barred windows. He sits in the darkness, as other strange forms surround him. But they care for him, and become his friends. From a distance, the men who took him whisper, saying that Orpington-Smythe is intent on building an army. The men vow to hide the children away, so he can never use them. They are moved to a big house- Braddock Manor. There they are cared for by the Braddocks, Betsy and Brian, as well as their butler Jeeves. But then one day, the Braddocks leave, and only the mysterious men who took him are there to care for him. Then one day, in the Mastermind cavern, he spies a bomb being planted. He tries to warn everyone, but then it detonates, and Mastermind stops working. A group of people cloaked in shadow come to take them away, and Beetroot finds himself at the Cloud 9 facility. Then the visions stop, and Beetroot is no more. Alistaire cries out in agony as he experiences Beetroot’s final moments, and punches Nigel square in the face. In response, Angus knocks him unconscious. Nigel orders the doctors to care for Alistaire, and conduct an autopsy on Beetroot to find what is causing the Warpies to destabilise and die.\nOn the English coast, Meggan rides a horse, Jackdaw, down the beach as she dreams of the future. Brian flies alongside her, but as Meggan watches him, he begins to become unsteady, before dropping to the ground. She leaps from Jackdaw and goes to his aid, as Brian realises he is losing his powers.\nIn Cloud 9, the Seraphim carrying Excalibur continue deeper into the complex. Nightcrawler senses his opportunity has arrived, and he teleports. He arrives, knocking Weasel into Cyanide, who in turn knocks Peanut from his contraption. Pumice turns to hit him, but as he puches, Nightcrawler pulls Cerise out of harm’s way, and Pumice hits Cyanide right in the face. As Cabbage comes for him, Nightcrawler uses his martial arts prowess to throw him onto Pumice, and together, the two Warpies tumble through a computer terminal. Peanut starts to worry, warning Nightcrawler he has unleashed serpents from the snakepit. Nightcrawler is unconcerned, until he realises just how many there are. Peanut begs Nightcrawler to save him and himself, but Nightcrawler refuses to leave Kitty and Cerise. Peanut decides to escape, but decides that as Nightcrawler won’t take him, then he’ll block Nightcrawler’s teleporting abilities. As Nightcrawler fights off the creatures, he realises for the first time that Cerise means more to him than just as a friend and ally, but as a lover. The serpents tear his costume, but he continues the fight, and gets to Kitty and Cerise. As he stands over them, the serpents back away, and Nigel arrives with his advocates to congratulate him. Nightcrawler angrily shouts at him for trying to kill them, but Nigel says that the serpents aren’t his problem. He then puts Nightcrawler, Kitty and Cerise under arrest, and disbands Excalibur…"

When asked how does he remember, he answers that his greatest desire is to remember every detail of his life that was mostly mind-wiped. Only Xavier could have found that out and Wanda must have granted his wish. Cage is willing to believe him, all because of the girl, Layla, who also knows that this reality is wrong, showing him that his real life is suppose to be with Jessica Jones and his child.

Watching from the shore are Alysande Stuart and Valeria von Doom who are watching Franklin while the others have their fun. Suddenly a massive and horrific creature appears in the sky and the Fantastic Four's boat is smashed to pieces by a mystical bolt. Valeria then erects an invisible barrier across the shore to block the mystical bolt from striking the building there. Out of the maelstrom comes the Fantastic Four and Alyssa who are being pulled in by the Invisible Woman via an invisible force field. Although the Fantastic Four survived the blast, Alyssa is unconscious. After hearing Franklin's recounting of how he saw a \"charcoal man\" during the attack, Reed rushes Alyssa down to his lab for examination. Much to Reed's surprise there is nothing physically wrong with her that would constitute her being in a coma. In the next room Johnny watches as Valeria and Franklin play. Watching this, Johnny admits to his sister that he doesn't totally trust Valeria due to her apparent father being Doctor Doom. Reed soon exits his lab and informs them that he cause of Alyssa's condition is due to magic. While they begin wondering why she was attacked, Valeria reveals that she hacked into Alyssa's database. Although Sue scolds her for this invasion of privacy, Valeria says she only did it to help Alyssa out. She then pulls up data Alyssa was compiling on the legendary Hellfire Club and how the Inner Circle is currently under the control of a woman named Selene. Reed is familiar with the club and its attempts at mutant dominion of the world.\nBecause this is a mystical problem, Reed starts placing calls to his allies who are adept at magic. There is no reply at Agatha Harkness' home in Whisper Hill, and a call to Avengers Mansion leads Reed to learn that the Scarlet Witch is presently away on team business. As the Avengers butler Jarvis offers to take information down, neither he nor Reed are aware that someone is listening into their conversation form within a barn in West Texas, and that this unseen listener is paying attention when Jarvis suggests that Reed contact Daimon Hellstrom. Although both the Thing and Valeria become aware that someone is hacking into their line, Reed allows it to continue when he contacts Doctor Strange. He reaches Strange's servant, Wong, who tells him that the Doctor is out and he recommends that they contact Margali Szardos. Recalling that this is the woman who helped them against the Ruined, Reed decides that they should liberate her from the French government. When Ben asks if they should be concerned over whoever was tapping their line, Reed suggests they let it go to see who their mystery spy is.\nAt that moment in Paris, Selene is walking the streets when she is approached by a jogger. When she seduces him into coming closer she uses a mystical artifact to steal his soul and replace it with that of a demon, putting the man into her thrall. The man, Bruno Delor, is a guard at Ile De Cite, the oldest prison in France and specially constructed to contain those with mystical abilities, this is where Margali Szardos is being held prisoner after being arrested by the French authorities. As \"Bruno\" begins enthralling other guards, the Fantastic Four have arrived and are bring brought to Margali's cell by their ally Rone. However when they open her cell the assassins begin to attack. Margali manages to warn them fast enough for Sue to erect an invisible force field around the cell. However in the ensuing battle, \"Bruno\" uses the device to steal the souls of the Fantastic Four. But before their souls can be replaced by those of demons a mysterious being called Mechamage teleports into the room and uses specially mystical siguls to block the transfer, saving the Fantastic Four from demonic possession. While the Fantastic Four hold the demonically possessed guards at bay, Mechamage uses her skills to crack the mystical bonds in Margali's cells allowing her to harness her magical powers and dispose of their attackers. Travelling through Limbo, Margali transports the group to collect Alyssa's body and then bring her to Margali's circus Der Jahrmarkt.\nAfter examining Alyssa, Margali informs the Fantastic Four that she is dying, and that they are as well, only due to their enhanced abilities they are enduring a much slower process. A cure is beyond the skills of both Margali or Mechamage. The Fantastic Four figure the solution to their problem resides within the Hellfire Club and resolve to get in and find the antidote. They suggest that the only one with the skill that can help them is Hellstrom, who according to Moy's files was traced to the Hellfire Club before he went missing. As Reed begins making adjustments to the mechanical components of Mechamage's mystical armor, Margali trains the Fantastic Four on how to defend themselves against magic. Later, while taking abreak, Johnny goes for a swim and comes across Mechamage meditating. When Johnny goes to relax on a glade, Mechamage comes up behind him and begins rubbing his back. Although Johnny likes it, she begs him not to look and he agrees to just enjoy the moment.\nLater, Mister Fantastic and Mechamage (disguised as Alyssa) infiltrate the Hellfire Club's Halloween party using an invitation sent to her. They are soon led into the basement along with the other guests where Selene announces the arrival of their new master, the demon Blackheart. When Blackheart begins transforming the other guests into demons, Mechamage protects herself and Reed, blowing their cover. While they fight off the demon hordes, Reed opens the door out allowing the rest of the Fantastic Four and Margali entrance into the Club. In the ensuing battle Blackheart sucks both Margali and Sue into his body. Mechamage then dives in and uses her technomystical armor to fight through the demonic mass and not only frees the two women, but Hellstrom as well. Hellstrom, Mechamage and Margali then combine their mystical powers to summon the four elements, utilizing the Fantastic Four as channels for each. In utilizing these elements they create massive statues in the forms of the Thing (earth), Mister Fantastic (water), Invisible Woman (wind), and the Human Torch (fire). These four statues create a binding spell that banishes Blackheart from this plane of existence, foiling Selene's plans.\nBack at Pier Four, the Fantastic Four learn from Alyssa Moy that she is going to return with Margali, Hellstrom, and Mechamage as they have formed a group called the Shadow Hunters for the purpose of fighting evil supernatural forces. As they teleport away, the Fantastic Four wish them all the best on their future endeavors."

She tells them ofFifty-One's plan to use theHydra Supreme Armorhe got from The Annex to get to theMyrmidonand launch an attack onMinneapolis, and offers to lead them to his location. The two heroes take off with her, leaving behind thePaladinsbehind. Before departing, Captain America suggests the young heroes to try to stop chasing the limelight and focus on the elementals of super heroing, which leaves them dejected.\nEden guides Iron Man and Captain America to theS.H.I.E.L.D. HelicarrierAdjunct. Meanwhile,Voxencourages his teammates to keep working hard, and to go find Fifty-One and help Iron Man and Captain America. Shortly after boarding theAdjunct, Captain America and Iron Man are attacked by the Myrmidon, giving Veronica the chance to slip away. Fifty-One suddenly appears and attacks the robot, to Tony and Steve's surprise. They notice Eden and follow her into a room that holds theOverseer, which turns out to be in control of the entire Helicarrier. Eden reveals she's colluding with the super-computer, and they plan to exterminate all super heroes and villains so that humankind can be the master of its own fate again. However, the Overseer quickly reveals it also intends to target humanity itself. Having planned for such eventuality, Veronica tries to destroy the Overseer with a voice command, but the super-computer has disabled this fail-safe, and instead unleashes an army of Myrmidons.\nIron ManandCaptain AmericahaveVeronica Edenrestrained atThe Annex. She's babbling in an attempt to get on the heroes' good side, offering information and disclosingFifty-One's plan to use theHydra Supreme Armorto get to theMyrmidonand launch an attack onMinneapolis, and tries to convince the heroes she can take them there. ThePaladinsare overlooking and gossiping from a distance. As he walks away from Eden with Steve, Tony suggests taking Veronica. He notices that Steve seems peeved, and asks if it's because of the resurgence of the Hydra Supreme Armor. Stark points out thatHydra Supremewasn't Rogers himself, but Steve insists he was still a version of himself. Tony manages to make Cap admit that he's disappointed his counterpart didn't fight back, and that he expected any version of himself to fight against fascism. Stark bluntly dismisses this notion of the armor being a symbol of Steve's failure, and places his hand on Steve's shoulder, reassuring him that he's there for him if he wants to talk. Steve questions what Tony is doing, and Stark states that he's being nice, sardonically asking Steve for confirmation that it does feel weird. Turning to Eden, Captain America tells her she will take them to Fifty-One and warns them against attempting any subterfuge.\nSteve walks up to the Paladins, andVoxeagerly attempts to offer assistance. While grabbing a high-tech rifle from the warehouse, Rogers interrupts him and declines the offer.Prima Donnainsists the Paladins have the responsibility to bring in their former teammate.Think Tankasks for any constructive criticism. As he inspects the weapon, Cap tells them they need to step out of the limelight and work on the fundamentals, to worry less about how they come across and more about simply doing the job. Steve walks away with the gun, telling the young heroes that they need to start small and get bigger, and that there are no shortcuts. The Paladins are left looking dejected.\nAs they fly on an aircraft through the sky, Captain America is being debriefed on the Myrmidon, looking at data about it on a tablet. Tony is piloting the plane, and Rogers asks him if the robot gave him much trouble back in the day. Stark admits that it did, but points out he was wearing an early suit, so he claims it doesn't count. When Steve asks who built it, Eden brings up theOverseer, a supercomputer A.I. once created to control the population of a small island. Tony states that it was limited, and that he could never find out who had built it. Stark turns to Eden and wonders if she gave him the right coordinates, since the scanners show nothing ahead. Veronica points out that it's cloaked, and also states that they were the same coordinates she provided to Fifty-One, so they need to be on the lookout for him. Eden tries to bring attention to her cooperativeness, but Cap asks if she's sure the Myrmidon is on board. AHelicarriercomes into view, and Eden introduces it as theAdjunct, where all the cool things are kept according to herself. In her inner monologue, Eden brings upStamford,Connecticutand recalls the 612 people who died after an incident involving theNew Warriors. She declares that she thinks about it often, as well as all the many dead people from other super hero encounters. She brings attention to the fact that what happened at Stamford is referred to as an incident, and affirms that kids like the Paladins were responsible.\nIn the city, the Paladins are lounging on the rooftop of a coffee shop, thinking back of Captain America's words. Eden's monologue continues; stating that the only thing to come out of it was the Civil War, but a few years go by and there are more unsupervised super heroes than ever. Vox attempts to lift his team's morale, but Prima Donna starts talking about her beautiful physique causing her problems to fit in, and laments that the Paladins failed to foster the respect they wanted. Think Tank starts to mock her, pointing out that he is a brain in a fishbowl. Primma Donna threatens him andPioneertries to defuse the situation. Prima Donna starts mocking her and her accent instead. Think Tank turns against Pioneer as well, and Vox interrupts his teammates. He tells that the team is facing adversity, and encourages them to carry on. He suggests to go stop Fifty-One and offer Captain America and Iron Man their assistance, stating that the two heroes don't really know what they're up against.\nAboard theAdjunct, Eden is standing at a distance from Iron Man and Captain America, who are confronting the Myrmidon. The robot has Tony on its grasp. Internally, she thinks that the heroes being already in a life-or-death struggle barely after boarding is the proof she needs that super heroes are a threat and are going to destroy the world, specifically those that seek out powers, claiming that they have an insane desire to be special. The Myrmidon throws Iron Man at Captain America, but Steve manages to dodge, while Tony stops his own fall and flies back towards the robot. As Steve uses the weapon he took from The Annex to fire an electric charge at the robot, Eden states that those that didn't have a choice in gaining powers likemutants,InhumansorEternalswill most likely side with the super heroes, and they will have to be dealt with as well. The heroes continue dealing the robot blows, and Captain America manages to tear off the Myrmidon's right arm. Eden's monologue expresses she wishes this didn't have to be done, but holds super heroes accountable for many world-threatening events. Fifty-One suddenly bursts into the scene, interrupting both Eden's inner monologue and the heroes' fight. He tackles the Myrmidon off a ledge, to the surprise of Iron Man and Captain America. Tony and Steve catch notice of Eden walking into a gate brimming with a red light. When they follow her, they find her leaning on the Overseer. The giant computer greets Iron Man, and Tony informs Steve that the Helicarrier's systems have been rerouted through this room, effectively making the Overseer the Helicarrier itself. As Tony confronts Eden, she and the computer reveal that they are not only in cahoots, but also in love. She tells the heroes that they know what A.I. is capable of and that true artificial intelligence leads to genuine emotions, citing theVision's romance with theScarlet Witch. The Overseer informs her that \"Myrmidon 8\" is reporting damage. She reveals to it that the cause is Fifty-One, who is invisible to the Overseer's sensors due to his armor. The computer declares it will implement the necessary steps, flustering Eden for its efficacy. Captain America is confused that Fifty-One isn't working with Eden after all, and she surmises so. She explains that it doesn't matter if he's trying to stop them since he's too late, and that if they don't get him now, they will when they go after the others. Iron Man asks if she means the Paladins, and Eden clarifies she means all super heroes.\nCaptain America accuses Eden of working withSenator Todd Bakerto take the reins ofHydrawhile he reactivatesS.H.I.E.L.D.and together steer the conflict as they see fit. Veronica admits that this plan to control all super heroes failed when she messed up andBaron Zemotook control of Hydra, so she decided to improvise, even if it gets her hands bloodier than she'd like. Eden reveals she intends to target heroes and villains alike; taking out anyone who is a threat to the population of the planet, and that they will use the information they got from theSuperhuman Registration Actto pre-emptively kill heroes. Captain America states she's going after people who have saved the world countless times, but Eden claims those threats were brought about by their own actions. Iron Man wonders if she thinks a lone Helicarrier and the Myrmidon will be enough, and Eden affirms that they have big plans. When Captain America questions who will defend the Earth after Eden and the Overseer have killed all super heroes, the giant computer states it will, alongside a robust and unified human military. Eden declares that humanity shall once again be master of its own fate, and the Overseer exclaims, \"Long live the New Tech.\" Fifty-One and the Myrmidon suddenly crash through the ceiling. Eden turns around to the Overseer, taking offense in its exclamation and wondering what will happen to her. A turret starts firing energy blasts at Iron Man and Captain America, Steve asks Tony to cover him while he offers Fifty-One assistance and shields him from the Myrmidon. In her inner monologue, Eden contemplates about the Overseer's betrayal. She maintains that betrayal is never about betrayal, but rather about \"a greater loyalty that the loyalty assumed,\" and that she finds it quite hard to feel betrayed by betrayal, but she will manage. The Overseer thanks Eden for her assistance and states that when humanity succumbs, they will know the name of the person who made it possible. It states that their partnership must come to an end, since Eden is far too cunning to be trustworthy. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Fifty-One continue fighting the Myrmidon. Stark manages to tear off the other arm of the robot. Captain America throws his shield at the robot, lodging it in its head. Then he jumps above the Myrmidon, grabbing his shield and using it as leverage to tear off its head. Iron Man and Fifty-One fire energy blasts at the same time, dealing a final blow. Stating to herself that she prepared for this eventuality, Eden repeatedly tells the Overseer that they are breaking up. The computer interrupts her to inform her that it has disabled all of her voice commands, so that destruct code will not work. Iron Man, Captain America and Fifty-One turn around as Veronica points past them, bringing their attention to an army of Myrmidons appearing from behind. In her internal monologue, Eden states that this is the problem with being sneaky; because no matter how sneaky somebody is, there is always someone sneakier."

As Xavier leaves, Kitty tells Peter that the X-Men should follow their dreams, as well as her wanting a life beyond the X-Men, thinking now might be the time for her to do so.\nXavier senses this, though he's confident that Kitty, despite her feelings of abandonment, betrayal and anger, would've likely done the same thing if she was in his shoes.\nAt the same time, at Xavier's, Wolverine, Rogue, Gambit, Marrow, Arcangel, Psylocke and Nightcrawler are playing a game of baseball. While Ororo is distracted and thinks that the X-Men are only going to face more turmoil due to the past several months' events, Logan assures her the team'll find a way to win whatever's thrown their way.\nOn Genosha, Magneto and Polaris watch a group of mutates battle a group of human rebels. When Lorna suggests they get the local fractions from killing each other, Magneto remarks that's why she's there, to help power him up due to his recently weakening abilities before they join the fight as well, Polaris wondering if she made the right call to join Magneto.\nMeanwhile, Mystique infiltrates the National Reconnaissance Office in order to try and clean up her tracks by finding who's responsible for the exposure of several of her previous identities.\nIn Genosha, a heated debate is taking place between the Acolytes and Fabian Cortez, who believes they should overthrow Magneto due to his weakening powers and the fact it's taking longer for him to recharge each time, though the debate is halted by Magneto as he returns with Polaris, who's still debating over her choice to join Magneto as any blood Magneto sheds might be on her hands, though she also wonders if she could take him on if she tried to.\nIn Alaska, Nate Gray approaches Jean as she's mediating as Phoenix and thinking about her own death. Sensing Nate is still blaming himself for Scott's death, Jean tells him it wasn't his fault, and that Apocalypse not taking the fact that the X-Men are willing to sacrifice themselves for each other into account was what led to his downfall.\nMeanwhile, Mimic, Toad, Blob and Post have gathered in a log cabin to plan a heist involving a secret weapon being made at Paradigm Micronics that could potentially make them rich.\nIceman and Beast arrive on Genosha in order for Hank to commit research on the Legacy Virus, due to Genosha having the biggest mutant population in the world as he fears someone might retrigger it, which would make the deaths the virus caused resume.\nBack at Xavier's, the X-Men are relaxing after their game when a hologram of the High Evolutionary arrives, much to the team's surprise.\nHigh Evolutionary then states that mutantkind is too dangerous and as such, he has decided to put an end to it.\nAdding that he doesn't wish to harm them, High Evolutionary adds he has built an energy field to neutralize the mutant genome, reverting the mutants to the humans they could've been.\nAs Rogue and Gambit protest this and Betsy makes a sarcastic remark, Kurt realizes that High Evolutionary's plan is already underway as he wouldn't have come otherwise.\nDespite this, High Evolutionary has prepared a rebuttal to their arguments, pointing out that in a world with no mutants, they won't be struggling to free themselves from the oppression most of them have been subjected to since either puberty or birth, nor will they need to worry about Magneto.\nLogan tries to reason with High Evolutionary, pointing out there are several other, non-mutant beings who're powerful, like Thor, Dr. Doom, Mandarin and Hulk, as well as pointing out that Scarlet Witch, Firestar, Quicksilver and Beast would also suffer and, as part of the Avengers, said team likely wouldn't take this lightly.\nDespite the somewhat reasonable argument, High Evolutionary begins the procedure and the effects are shown around the globe: Kitty and Colossus both convulse with agony as their powers are stripped away, while in Alaska, Jean crash lands onto the ground, with Sunfire and X-Man doing the same in their respective locations.\nAt the same time, Cable feels the techno-organic virus in him attack as his own powers vanish while the members of both X-Force and Generation X also experience their own powers being stripped away.\nAs Aurora, Northstar and Sabra also scream in agony as their own abilities are neutralized, Magneto and the Acolytes undergo the same thing as Magneto realizes that, should word get out, the island's factions will certainly come for him as revenge.\nMystique, almost done with her scheme, suddenly undergoes the procedure herself, making her easy prey for some guards as it causes her to briefly black out in pain. At the same time, Post, Mimic, Blob and Toad also get stripped of their powers, causing Blob to become very skinny, though retaining his massive folds of skin, Post becoming a normal man and Mimic to lose his current and previous abilities (though Toad seems thrilled as the procedure has given him a very handsome appearance and he's now able to stand upright like a normal person).\nAs they also undergo the depowering process, Bobby and Hank (the latter now with only a few clumps of fur on his body) hear the same thing is happening globally, prompting Hank to suspect that somebody else may also be involved.\nAfter the procedure is done, High Evolutionary tells the X-Men (as Warren loses the last of his feathers and Kurt completely turns human) that while he knows it seems unfair, he hopes that they'll accept everything in time. Xavier's dream is now complete. High Evolutionary then tells the group to enjoy their new lives as he departs, leaving the still in shock X-Men completely... ordinary.\nThe story continues inX-Men(Vol. 2) #99."

The Tribunal shows them more of the future, in which aliens who came to Earth mysteriously committed suicide after battling the Defenders. These aliens were part of a war-like race called the Kamado from the planet Mikkaz. Their Prince Ch’kra was the son of their ruler, King Ch’kri, who had disowned Ch’kra for rejecting war and embracing a peaceful lifestyle. Prince Ch’kra fled Mikkraz with his followers and was pursued by the Kamado Empire and their allies wherever they went. When they landed on Earth and were confronted by the Defenders, they assumed their foes had been sent by the Empire to return them to Mikkraz. Knowing they would be tortured if they were brought back to the Empire, they chose to kill themselves. Fifty years later, King Ch’kri learned about the circumstances of his son’s death and chose a new heir to inherit rule of the Empire. However, the Kamado tradition is for the new heir to wipe away any record of the previous heir’s existence. Since Ch’kra and his followers died on Earth, the Empire destroyed all life on the planet. The Defenders vow to prevent these events from happening, but the Tribunal has examined all possible futures and claims that the tragedy cannot be prevented as long as the four remain Defenders, because their combined lifelines will somehow result in the future they have been shown. Back on Earth, Valkyrie returns to the Defenders with Moondragon, who has been placed in Valkyrie’s charge by Odin so that she may learn humility.  Due to her past abuse of her mental powers, Moondragon is forced to wear a headband that restricts the use of that power. Having worked with Moondragon in the Avengers, the Beast is not happy about her arrival. However, he and Iceman are both thrilled to see their old X-Men partner, the Angel, who came to visit. Their housekeeper, Dolly Donahue, announces that Patsy Walker and Daimon Hellstrom are getting married that weekend, so they need to start getting ready. Their conversation is overheard by Patsy’s ex-husband, Buzz Baxter—now known as Mad Dog—who has been given super powers by the Secret Empire and plans to crash the wedding. Angel explains that he had been doing some soul-searching since being captured by the Morlocks’ leader, Callisto, but he has regained his confidence. Beast announces his intentions to make the Defenders a real team and invites Angel, Iceman, Valkyrie, and Gargoyle to be a part of it. Moondragon refuses, but Beast says that she wasn’t invited. While the other Defenders contemplate the Beast’s offer, they all fly to Patsy and Daimon’s wedding, where the ceremony is interrupted by Mad Dog and Mutant Force, who were recruited to help him by the Secret Empire. Mad Dog seeks revenge on his ex-wife, but Moondragon staggers him with a psychic blast, enabling Hellstrom to defeat him. The rest of the Defenders make short work of the Mutant Force, and the ceremony continues. The Beast points out that they all worked well together, and he again asks them to be part of his new team.  Everyone agrees, including Moondragon, whom Beast reluctantly accepts into the team. Suddenly, the four original Defenders arrive at the wedding, and since they are forced to disband, they give their blessings to the “New” Defenders."

Apparently, given that they are simultaneously psychic and not psychic, capable of awakening the unconscious memories of a person even in a reality warp, she is described as a conundrum. Emma offers her to coach Layla to help them gather any heroes to save the world.\nWhen they return to the physical world, a confused Cyclops has come in. Layla, with Emma's help, awakens Cyclops to the truth of their situation. He barfs as a result, before asking about Professor Xavier. Wolverine then explains that they don't know and he isn't at the Institute. But there are a few people they can locate.\nPeter Parker is enjoying a nice day with his family. Then, right in front of him are the awakening heroes. Layla restores his memories, causing him to freak out from the shock, especially to see Gwen Stacy and his Uncle Ben alive, and runs off. While Emma telepathically suggests that his family go to the park, Wolverine locates Peter up on a rooftop, trying to convince himself that this is a trick of Mysterio's. After a short talk with Wolverine, Peter states that he will beat Magneto and his family to death with his bare hands.\nThe heroes then locate and awaken Kitty Pryde, Stephen Strange, Carol Danvers, Tony Stark, Jennifer Walters and Matt Murdock. However, they don't select Steve Rogers, who had never gone through World War II and therefore is an old man.\nEmma explains to the assembled heroes their theory that Magneto used his daughter Wanda to create this world and used Xavier to discover and grant their deepest desires so they'd feel comfortable. She then asks if there are any doubts; there are none, except for Hawkeye, whose thoughts she is able to read. She asks that he allow Layla to awaken his true memories, but he refuses to have his head poked in. Wolverine and Murdock sense the Red Guard's approach, who crash through the wall. As the fighting begins, Rogue grabs Layla by the hair and demands that they all surrender. However, her exposed finger touches Layla's skin, causing her to absorb her power and quickly awaken the rest of the Red Guard; Mystique, shocked that she was in a relationship with Wolverine in this reality, slips him across the face, breaking her hand. Danvers then notices that Hawkeye's gone. As everyone adjusts and asks for a plan, Wolverine states that they must go to Genosha to get the whereabouts of Xavier from Magneto.\nIn Genosha, Polaris approaches her father Magneto, to inform him that their guests will be arriving soon. He promises to attend to that, but first want to approach the Xavier Memorial Garden, which reads \"He died so Genosha could live.\"\nCharacters in this story also appear in other stories between this issue.

As Warren decides to follow her, the other X-Men discuss Lorna’s disappearance. Iceman is angry that Havok did not do anything, but without being able to fly there is not much Scott’s brother could have done to help Lorna.\nA little later, Lorna finds herself in a dark room and is greeted by Tad Carter who introduces her to the group named “The Promise”. The leader is Tobias Messenger who is a telepath like Charles Xavier but can only communicate via telepathy because he is mute. Messenger explains that the initial group of mutants was formed by a would-be world conqueror named the Claw. But the Claw’s plans failed, and Tobias Messenger took over the group giving them a different purpose. The Promise expects a war between mutants and humans, and they put themselves in suspended animation for intervals of ten years. When they are awake like now, they observe the current political situation and, if necessary, act as the voice of reason among the mutant community. But they also continue to recruit new members and Lorna Dane is their preferred candidate because she is yet not indoctrinated by either Professor X or Magneto.\nIn Dunfee, Illinois, Professor X and Teri Martin have another private conversation. Xavier senses that Teri is wishing her daughter would not have experienced the incident with the Sentinel and all subsequent official investigations. Teri agrees, but she does not regret meeting Charles Xavier.\nMeanwhile, Angel called the X-Men and guides them to the location he believes Lorna drifted to. However, a force field prevents the X-Men from entering the area. Marvel-Girl is not able to detect anything. The whole area feels like a black hole to her telepathic senses. Suddenly, one huge and several smaller monsters appear out of nowhere and attack the X-Men. Too late Cyclops recognizes that the smaller monsters were illusions “covering” the actual X-Men and, thus, the X-Men take each other out one by one. Gracie Smith, another telepath that is part of the Promise, was responsible for the illusions. Now the group members argue about what to do with the defeated X-Men. Havok is seen as a potential recruit like Lorna, but Lucie Robinson insists on bringing Angel into the group because she thinks he is beautiful. The next time Lorna awakes, she is being put into a hibernation chamber and starts to scream in fear …"

Aside from being allergic to cat-hair, Jarvis finds the flirtatious Tigra to be a jarring change from the usually more dignified former Avengers. Tigra gives the Avengers’ manservant a quick recap of her origin as the superheroine the Cat and her transformation into a feline being.\nIn New Jersey, the Pyms are getting ready for the first new meeting since the roster shake-up. Hank is in a particularly surly mood and is curt and belligerent towards Jan, who does her best to placate him.\nAs the new team assembles at the mansion, Yellowjacket’s angry attitude extends into the meeting. When Cap calls for an election to decide on a new leader, Iron-Man and Thor say they’d like him to be officially named group leader. Hank raises a fuss that he wasn’t consulted on the manner.  Wasp is embarrassed and dismayed by her husband’s actions but says nothing.\nMeanwhile, in a secluded vale that is shielded from outsiders by a magical spell, two beings have dwelled in isolation for ten thousand years: Linnea, the enchanted Elfqueen, and her consort, the brutish warrior Gorn. Although Linnea prefers their simple secluded life, Gorn is weary and restless for new adventures. He demands that they leave the vale and explore the world outside them.\nAs it turns out, the pair live in Virginia on the outskirts of Washington D.C. Gorn is perplexed by the outside world but refuses Linnea’s pleas that they return to their vale. When Gorn strikes Linnea in anger, she abruptly abandons him. Gorn is repentant but left alone. Unable to comprehend modern life on his own, he gets into a scuffle with a street gang and is then shot and killed by a police officer. When Gorn dies, Linnea returns to wreak havoc on the city.\nThe Avengers are alerted to the situation and are about to depart in a quinjet. Yellowjacket has an issue with his stingers, for which the Wasp offers her assistance. Hank tears into Jan right in front of the rest of the team, accusing her of throwing her money around and condescending to him. Jan runs off in tears. Yellowjacket tells the team to forget her and stomps into the quinjet. His team-mates hesitantly follow him.\nIn D.C., Linnea proves to be powerful enough to take on the entire team by herself. Yellowjacket is still being plagued with technical issues and can’t fire his stingers. At a critical junction, Captain America manages to overcome their language barrier and calm the Elfqueen down in order to talk to her. Yellowjacket has managed to fix his stingers and shoots a bolt into Linnea’s back. She resumes attacking the Avengers, throwing a car at him. His stingers fritz out again and he is helpless to stop the attack, but the Wasp (who has flown to D.C. on her own volition) manages to destroy it with a sting just in the nick of time to save him.\nCap realizes the Elfqueen is not truly evil and gets the team to back off. Linnea ceases her attacks, gathering up Gorn’s dead body and departing peacefully. As the story ends, the Avengers are left discussing their encounter while Yellowjacket stands off on his own, sulking bitterly.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nLocations:\nItems:"

One of them sprays insulting graffiti on the garage door, but just as he finishes, Virginia phases her arm through the door and slams him against the door, breaking his nose and knocking him unconscious. She then enters the driveway and threatens the other boy.\nLater that night, Virginia leaves Vision a voice message asking to talk when he gets the chance. As she does, the narrator describes how the evergreen the Scarlet Witch gave them was actually a house tree that she received from Agatha Harkness for HER family with Vision, only for it to outlive the entire family and Agatha prior to their resurrections.\nViv is shown to have been taken to Avengers Headquarters, where Vision intends to repair her with the help of Tony Stark. His plan is to send a major current through Viv’s body that will allow her halves to be rejoined, which Tony jokingly warns could cause a major power outage, as well as cause Vision serious pain. Tony starts the current, which creates a massive burst of electricity. When nothing seems to happen despite its continued use, Tony tries to shut it off, but Vision refuses, outright threatening to kill Tony if he stops it. After a bit more, the procedure stops, and Viv revives, fully restored, and reunites with Vision.\nVision and Viv then return home and are reunited with Virginia and Vin. Later that night, Vision is getting ready for bed. He tells Virginia that repairs on the house will begin soon, and that Tony convinced S.H.I.E.L.D. to launch a manhunt on the Grim Reaper. However, Virginia doesn’t listen, instead dressing in lingerie and seducing him.\nMuch earlier in Transia, Agatha is seen with her cat Ebony overlooking a cliff. Agatha convinces Ebony to eat a flower from another evergreen, which is believed to give the consumer clairvoyance. She then takes a sowing needle and impales Ebony in the neck. Enraged, Ebony transforms into her wildcat form and attacks Agatha, but Agatha takes the needle and uses it to slit Ebony’s throat. It is revealed that the clairvoyant powers only come into effect when the flower is directly eaten from the body of someone who has already eaten it. Using this, Agatha proceeds to eat Ebony’s stomach. Agatha then falls into a hysterical fit as she receives the vision, which details Vision annihilating the world’s heroes in the near future, beginning with him moving his family to the town.\n• A house attacked. A daughter dying. An old, dead friend screaming out in pain. This wasn't how it was supposed to go.\n• The Vision created his family to be normal. This isn't normal. This is terrifying. And it's just the beginning."

He pleads before them that he was there when they were born and every moment of their lives and now he will watch them die. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning kills him. The five figures are revealed to bechildren of the Avengers.\nAs theAvengersare repairingSoldier FieldinChicago,Captain Steve Rogersstates that the world doesn't needH.A.M.M.E.R.orS.H.I.E.L.D., but the Avengers, more than ever. Many answer the call, all exceptWonder Man, seeing that the Avengers have caused more harm than good, citing theSuperhuman Civil War, theHouse of M, theSkrull Invasionand Osborn'sDark Reignas proof. Rogers points out that the Avengers stopped all of that and the Civil War is another story. Wonder Man still refuses and pleads Rogers to not go through with this and if he does not, he will change his decision for him.\nInAvengers Tower, Rogers has assembledBucky,Thor,Hawkeye,Spider-Man,Wolverine,Spider-WomanandIron Manto be their next group of Avengers, all for their great qualities. As the team begins to socialize on their doubts and insecurities whether can they work together, Iron Man asks Rogers who is going to run the team. The latter answers that it will beMaria Hill, who asks if this is the entire team, as someone is missing. Then suddenly, Kang the Conqueror appears to deliver a dire warning, only for Thor to blast him out of the building.\nAs the Avengers then go out to confront him on a rooftop, Kang produces out an egg-shaped device that Iron Man recognizes, it is a dark matter accelerator, a doomsday device he hasn't even built yet, capable of inverting the entire city ofNew York. Kang then cuts to the chase and explains that in the future,Ultronhas destroyed the Avengers and conquered the Earth. Only their future children will stop him, only to rule the world themselves, having no morals because their parents were not there to guide them. They need to go to the future and stop them before they can do that. This revelation shocks the Avengers, Hawkeye even asks Kang why can not he stop Ultron.\nThe reply is that he has tried twenty times. He then leaves through a portal, telling them that they must obtain time travel technology on their own to stop this terrible future from ever occurring. If they succeed, he will never attempt to menace them again. But he promises this: he won't put his destiny into the hands of the Avengers or their children, which will compel him to activate the device the next time they meet. Iron Man tries insisting that they don't have a time machine, Kang responds that they will when their team is complete.\nAs soon as Kang is gone, Spider-Man asks Iron Man if he even has a time machine. The answer is no, for if he had one, he could've prevented any of their recent, terrible events from ever occurring but become no better than Kang himself. Hawkeye further asserts that Kang shouldn't have told them that they'd even end up having kids. Iron Man then goes into a hypothesis that time and space are actual organisms, which means that past and future is happening now. Even if the future isn't their problem, Thor asserts that they must go to it to save their children. The problem is coming up with a time machine and finding an expert on not only time but interdimensional travel that would not damage reality. The only people they know, such asDoctor Doom, who can't be trusted orMr. Fantastic, who is not available, have one. However, Wolverine knows the right person for this job.\nIn the future, Kang arrives to report the success of his mission to an elderlyHulkand a Spider-Girl.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:"

Iron Man says he feels that it was their fault the Kree-Skrull War came to Earth. His reasoning is that each one of them had the knowledge of the enemy.\nBut, if the heroes of Earth, the only protectors for their people, unite into a superhero government, then they can be better prepared for another invasion. Unfortunately, many disagree; Namor doesn't believe that they control heroes even in the knit-tight groups they have now; Mr. Fantastic points out that there would be fight over leadership; Doctor Strange expresses that bureaucracy would conflict with heroes; Xavier also points out that the Skrulls nearly turned the public against the Avengers, giving them the same feeling that the general population feels against mutants. Iron Man attempts to assert that if they could champion the X-Men's cause, then mutant-human relations could improve and end the hatred.\nHowever, T'Challa says that it would do the opposite; the people would simply have an excuse to hate heroes as well. Also, there are many rebel type heroes, like Spider-Man and Daredevil, counterculture. And their group is counter-establishment. Iron Man states that he just wants to do more. Namor cuts in, accusing Iron Man and Xavier of having questionable characters on their respective teams; he even asks Black Bolt if his brother, who was the architect of the invasion, was executed or not.\nTherefore, Iron Man's fantasy is just impossible. Nonetheless, Mr. Fantastic agrees that the information they know could help deal with larger threats in the future. However, Namor tells them that they cannot tell anyone about this meeting, not friends or family; he doesn't want a secret about Atlantis leaked. Iron Man says that the invasion was bigger than any of them and they need to be prepared. Strange asks if they will have an honor system in their newly formed group; Iron Man says that no secret can be kept from Xavier, which he reluctantly agrees to.\nEveryone but T'Challa agrees to this proposal, who demands that they end this debate and walk away. He reminds them that the Skrulls had an easy time attempting to turn the public against the Avengers, simply because everyone knew what could happen. He asks what would happen if one of them disagrees on a world-changing moment. Nonetheless, the newly formed Illuminati decides to stay. The first subject is about Krakoa...\nSometime later, the Hulk has smashed Las Vegas, killing twenty-six people and a dog. Iron Man has a discussion with S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Maria Hill, who believes that they can't control the Hulk anymore. She states Norman Osborn, aka the Green Goblin, as example, for all the times he escapes whereas Spider-Man doesn't finish the job. She asks Iron Man if he is doing anything, for the government is looking for a reason to blame heroes.\nAt the Avengers' Hydrobase, Iron Man throws up the proposal to launch the Hulk into space to the Illuminati, excluding Xavier. Only Namor is opposed to this, accusing them of not being able to cure Banner to the best of their abilities. Mr. Fantastic and Strange explain they did all they could from dampening his powers to banishing him to the crossroads. However, Namor sees this as punishment for what the Scarlet Witch did to the Avengers. Nonetheless, everyone but Namor votes for Iron Man's plan. Namor responds by punching Iron Man out of the complex before tangling with him, tearing off his helmet underwater. They are both brought up magically by Strange.\nA struggling Namor says that Banner would return from where they send him and he will kill them all and he'll be right. He dives underwater after Iron Man tells Strange to let him go, admitting that T'Challa was right too.\nThe Illuminati goes forth with their plan, using a Nick Fury LMD to trick Banner onto a \"malfunctioning\" weapons satellite, which is actually a starship, which sends the Hulk far from Earth.\nIn the present, the Illuminati has gathered once again, excluding Xavier again, where Iron Man reveals his knowledge that the U.S. government is planning on passing the Superhuman Registration Act. It involves any superhuman, including mutants, to reveal their identities to the government and become an accountable employee. Refusing to do so is considered a federal crime.\nAlready, S.H.I.E.L.D. is developing its own special unit to take down superhumans. Namor sees it as a simple solution to take care of everyone else just like he did the Hulk. Iron Man insists that everything, House of M, the 198, the Secret War and the Avengers disbandment has all lead to this. He insists that all of them support registration before things get ugly, before someone is made an example of. He explains his views:\nA hero, probably a young one... one of the Young Avengers, or those kids in Los Angeles... Some carefree, happy-go-lucky, well-meaning young person, with thebestof intentions, will do somethingwrong.He'll be trying to save someone--do something heroic--but he'll make amistake.Turn to the left instead of the right--and people will be hurt or killed because of it. And it'll happen on live TV, or it'll be recorded... and, like Rodney King, it'll play over and over and over... All over the world. Until... the unrest that isalreadybubbling willboilover... and every politician looking to make a name for himself will run right on TV and they'll tell America how they are going tosave the worldfrom theseout-of-controlcostumed characters who think the law doesn't apply to them. And half of us will go along with it and half of us won't. And because of this mini-rebellion, our lawmakers will be forced to make an example of someone. Someone like our friendSpider-Man.Someone they can make a real spectacle of. Someone they can unmask on TV, destroy his marriage and family and pin a crime or two on! All for the whole world to see. And the countrywillrupture. Sides will be taken and peoplewillget hurt. Friend against friend. People who used to be adversaries finding themselves teamed up against a common cause. Friendsdyingat the hands of a former ally or teammate. That is whatwillhappen.\nIron Man repeats his request for them all to support this act; Namor views this as the result of what wouldn't have happened if they had created Iron Man's fantasy about a superhero government. Iron Man insists that they should had listened to him then. However, Namor sees this as no concern of Atlantis and threatens war if the surface comes after his kingdom. Strange also disagrees, stating that it would simply be giving in to people's fear and ignorance. Their friends would fight against registration, even to the death, for their rights. However, Mr. Fantastic completely agrees with Iron Man's point of view, compelling Strange to leave. Black Bolt also disagrees. Mr. Fantastic notes that it was fun while it lasted."

The test shows that despite being on vacation since his marriage to Madelyne Pryor, Cyclops is still at the peak of his abilities. With the session over, both Wolverine and Moira congratulate Cyclops on a job well done. They are interrupted by Rachel, who has come to try and tell Cyclops that in her time he and Jean Grey are her parents but chokes up. Moira then impatiently calls Cyclops up to the control room to discuss what she had asked him to return to the X-Men for. Cyclops and Wolverine discuss Rachel's past and before Wolverine can explain why Rachel seems to be so transfixed on Scott, Moira cuts in. She explains that Charles Xavier has not fully recovered from his recent beating[1]and is in fact dying. Cyclops is shocked by this and refuses to believe that the Professor will die and expresses the fact that he doesn't believe Magneto would have reformed. When he asks how long Charles has, Moira tells him that he may live long enough to see Scott and Madelyne's child be born. Overhearing this telepathically causes Rachel to burst into tears.\nMeanwhile, in Washington DC, Valerie Cooper returns home to the shock of her life: A woman in her house who looks exactly like her. It actually turns out to be Mystique, and she reveals her true form. She explains that due to the growing anti-mutant sentiment in America she wishes to give up the services of her Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to the government for full amnesty and protection from any mutant control laws that have been passed. She offers that the group could change its name to Freedom Force and it would be under the full control of the government, unlike the Avengers or Fantastic Four. Valarie likes the idea, however, she tells Mystique that this \"Freedom Force\" is going to have to show its good faith and prove their intentions to the President. She challenges Mystique to take down the Brotherhood's original leader, Magneto.\nMeanwhile, Rachel Summers has traveled to Annandale-On-Hudson to visit the grave of her mother Jean Grey to pay her respects. When she goes to the Grey family home she waits for John and Elaine -- her grandparents in her home reality --to leave their home so she can look around. Inside she begins being haunted by the psychic imprints of the Dark Phoenix confronting her parents and her own early childhood memories, visiting the home with her parents when she was only an infant. Going up into the Grey's bedroom, Rachel comes across the holo-matrix globe given to them by Lilandra[2]. Peering into it, Rachel unleashes the full fury of her powers, creating a Phoenix effect. Rachel decides that she will live up to her mother's ideals, and prove that Phoenix is not a force of evil, but one for good. That she vows to use her full abilities to defend humans and mutants alike, in her name. The sudden flare of powers causes Rachel to blackout and as she collapses on the floor, the globe falls out of her hands and smashes on the floor.\nAt the Washington National Holocaust Memorial, Magneto and Kitty Pryde both go to an annual gathering of Holocaust survivors. Magneto because he himself lived through and survived the Holocaust, while Kitty's great-aunt went missing during the war and she is trying to find the connection for her late grandfather Samuel Prydeman who died the last year. Through talking to other survivors, Kitty learns that her great-aunt Chava Rosanoff was arrested and sent to Auschwitz, where she was murdered. After Magneto meets with some of the other survivors he himself knew in Auschwitz, he is reminded how important it is for human/mutant peace to endure as history could repeat itself for the mutant race.\nThe gathering is interrupted when Mystique gets close enough to Magneto by posing as Lee Forester. Revealing her true form she calls Magneto to take accountability for his past terrorist actions, pointing out that in the past he acted no worse than Hitler himself. Magneto uses his powers to bind Mystique in steel girders. Then the other members of the new Freedom Force arrive: Blob, Pyro, Avalanche, Destiny, and Spiral (who has joined the group while she searches for Longshot on Earth[3]). While Magneto uses his powers to gently coax the innocent bystanders out of the building, he sends Kitty to get the rest of the X-Men.\nMagneto holds the former Brotherhood at bay until the other X-Men arrive to defend their unlikely ally. Shadowcat takes out Destiny, while Colossus takes out Pyro. Nightcrawler teleports the Blob onto the top of the Washington Monument, while Rogue knocks out Avalanche. However, the battle ends when Spiral casts a spell that locks Magneto into place and Mystique puts a gun to his head. Spiral is then knocked out by Cyclops and there is a Mexican stand-off between Freedom Force and the X-Men when Wolverine manages to sneak up behind Mystique, close enough to get his claws near her head. When Cyclops tells the X-Men to retreat and leave the \"Brotherhood\" for the police, Mystique explains Freedom Force's new law-abiding stance and tells them that they have come to arrest Magneto.\nBefore the X-Men can do anything, Magneto decides that if he is to truly reform then he must stand accountable for his crimes and stand trial and therefore allows himself to be arrested."

The Thing tries to tackle the Absorbing Man but suddenly reverts back to human form, forcing Spider-Woman to come to his aid. While Thor ties up Doctor Octopus, Pile Driver tries to square off against Hawkeye, but cowers away when the bowman manages to strike him with an arrow. The Hulk comes crashing in on the Enchantress but is knocked out by her enchanted charms. When she tries the same thing on Captain America, he resists her long enough to knock her out with his shield. While Spider-Man squares off against Titania, Hawkeye and Ben Grimm run into Klaw and the Lizard and are concerned that they are outmatched. Iron Man, Mister Fantastic, Thor and Spider-Woman later locate Volcana and Molecule Man and try to attack. Molecule Man responds by erecting an indestructible screen around them and Volcana unleashes large fire blasts that fries Iron Man's armor, but Captain Marvel manages to pass through in her light form, and the heroes cease their hostilities when they find out that Owen has been seriously injured. While not far away, Spider-Man manages to get the best of Titania, delivering her a humiliating defeat and knocking her out of the fortress.\nMeanwhile, Captain America and the Human Torch are squaring off against Ultron. Ultimately the Torch defeats the robot by unleashing his nova flame, overheating his circuits and rendering the killer robot inert. Captain America then storms into Doom's quarters and seeing the state that Doctor Doom is in, considers Doom no threat and leaves. With the battle over, Mister Fantastic and the others find Hawkeye and Ben Grimm playing patty-cake, thanks to the limited intellect of their foes. Soon She-Hulk is found and is placed in the medical bay along with the defeated members of the Wrecking Crew, while the rest of the villains are locked up. While back in the alien village, Colossus rushes the unconscious Zsaji to her room. There he finds the bottle of mind melding gas and uses it to learn what ills her. He discovers that the constant use of her powers to heal the various heroes have taxed her system and threaten to kill her. Colossus then professes his love to Zsaji. Elsewhere, Hawkeye and Captain Marvel return to discover that Zsaji pushed her powers to the limit so she could revive the Wasp. While from their look out, the members of the X-Men notice that Galactus is getting dangerously close to completing his world devouring device."

Armed with an arsenal of advanced weaponry, the Punisher seeks his revenge by hunting down Spider-Man, Magneto, Captain America, the Kingpin, Daredevil, Doctor Doom, the Hulk, Venom, Wolverine and more. One by one, group by group, the one-man army means to kill them all! Then, in another nightmarish reality, a terrible plague sweeps the Earth, turning everyone — human, hero, villain, god and monster — into sadistic cannibal predators. One man hunts the wasteland that was New York City, standing against the hordes of monsters who hunt the night. He is the Punisher, the Last Gun on Earth!"

Sabretooth remains behind, however, and begins to sniff something out. Wolverine arrives at the Inner Circle chambers where Forearm lies done, having been killed after going through a strange portal, his body returning with a message. The message reads that Arkon has conquered Krakoa's sister island of Arakko and challenges the X-Men to a 10v10 sword duel for the fate of both islands. Cyclops isn't sure they should engage, but Apocalypse eagerly accepts the challenge. Apocalypse, Archangel, Rogue, Cyclops, Psylocke, Nightcrawler, Solarr, Silver Samurai, Shatterstar, and Storm go through the portal to confront Arkon, whose team includes the Brood Queen, Lady Deathstrike, Ms. Marvel, Arcade, the Horsemen of Apocalypse, Eric the Red, and Sauron.\nOn Krakoa, Forearm is revived by the Resurrection Protocols, but comes back further mutated and angry, so Beast goes to warn the others that dying in Arkon's realm makes you come back wrong. In Arkon's realm, Solarr is quickly killed while Rogue spars with Ms. Marvel, who seems to want revenge for Rogue stealing her powers. Psylocke finds out that the Brood Queen is actually a mech piloted by Deadpool, who almost tells Psylocke about the Jubilee thing before Beast breaks in to warn the others. However, Deadpool's mech falls and crushes Beast and Silver Samurai, killing them both. Wolverine kills Lady Deathstrike, who reveals in her last words that Trask is still alive. Apocalypse and Arkon then face off, but Arkon is killed from behind by Genesis, Apocalypse's wife and queen of Arakko.\nGenesis and Apocalypse send the Arakko mutants to live on Krakoa, while Apocalypse and Archangel stay behind to help Arakko rebuild from Arkon's takeover. Back on Krakoa, X-Force stands guard as Silver Samurai, Solarr, and Beast are resurrected wrong again, but Beast assures that everything is fine. Xavier and Magneto, meanwhile, plan to go to space to make space for all the Arakko mutants.\nXCII OF SWORDS!"

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nJublilee explains that in her first life, she was killed by a Sentinel before ever realizing she was a mutant. She was then reborn with all her memories, but was killed by a Sentinel again. In her third life she finally met the X-Men, but no matter what she did, the Sentinels always won. In her ninth life, she and Nimrod learned that she only had one life left, and then Nimrod killed her. In the present, she stays hidden away on Krakoa, knowing both that her death was necessary to unite mutantkind and that it would all fall apart if they discovered her ruse.\nWhile Rogue takes a team to bring more mutants to Krakoa, Beast works in a lab with Mr. Sinister, who is secretly working on a Chimera Project. At a sparring match, Sabretooth tries to be friendly with Wolverine, but Wolverine isn't having any of it. He goes to see Jean Grey, who is connected to all the training and projects happening on Krakoa. She is then called off to an Inner Circle meeting, while Wolverine secretly goes to investigate Jubilee's death.\nAt the Inner Circle meeting, Xavier lies to the other leaders of Krakoa that the X-Men's mission to the Master Mold satellite was a success. The Orchis Council then sends a multi-headed, multi-armed Sentinel to attack Krakoa. Cyclops has Jean rally all the nearby mutants to fight back and protect Krakoa, then destroys the Sentinel thanks to Fabian Cortez supercharging his optic blast. As Cyclops claims that Krakoa works, Orchis receives all of the data on the mutants the Sentinel took while it was attacking. Wolverine then sniffs his way to Jubilee's hiding place, trailed by Sabretooth.\nDAWN OF XCII!"

As superheroes mingle, Jean and Cyclops announce that Krakoa is changing its X-Men roster, with every X-Man chosen by a psychic vote. While the vote is going on, Sabretooth goes to see Mr. Sinister, who had hired him to look into Krakoa's secrets. However, Sabretooth instead finds Mr. Sinister tied up by Beast, who has ambitious plans for Krakoa now that his resurrection has freed him of morals.\nBack at the Gala, the new X-Men team is chosen, consisting of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Rogue, Feral, Sunfire, Random, and Polaris. Then to finish the Gala off, Jean harnesses the power of the Phoenix Force for creation instead of destruction, and works with some other powerful mutants to create Asteroid X, a space habitat for the mutants of Arakko. Wolverine tells Cyclops that the Phoenix Force is trouble and that he's becoming rotten.\nAt Orchis HQ, Trask, in the body of a Sentinel, claims that mutants are better than humans, which means the only thing left to stop the mutants is the machines. Trask then proceeds to kill the rest of Orchis before making his way towards Earth. Meanwhile, having stormed off from the Gala, Wolverine catches Sabretooth's scent and tracks it to Jubilee's hiding ground. There, he finds that Beast, Sabretooth, and the other mutants resurrected from Arkon's realm have captured Jubilee and know her secret.\nREIGN OF XCII!"

Sure, it's just a publicity stunt for the beleaguered mayor-and yeah, maybe every single other super hero was busy that day -- but an award is an award!\nOf course, Spider-Ham isn't paying attention to the fine print telling him he didn't actually get to keep the key, and he swings off without returning the highly coveted oversized object. The next day, when the mayor's office finally gets in touch to ask for the key back, Spider-Ham realizes he must have dropped it sometime in the last 24 hours. YIKES."

Trask easily defeats the Shi'ar Imperial Guard and X-Men before making his way to Krakoa, where Beast suggests using one of Mr. Sinister's Chimeras to stop him. The Inner Circle is against the unregulated use of cloning in the Chimera, but ultimately has no choice when nothing else is working against Trask. The Chimera arrives and teleports Trask into the Sun, seemingly killing them both.\nWith Trask gone, everyone turns their attention to Beast, who explains that the Chimeras can use shapeshifting to replace political leaders and take over the world, ensuring mutant supremacy. Xavier tells Beast that Krakoa is a peaceful nation and that the X-Men will stop him, but Beast assures Xavier that the Chimeras have already taken over. The X-Men also learn that Beast has Wolverine and Jubilee, forcing Xavier to explain to everyone what Jubilee's deal is.\nNobody is happy about Xavier lying, but they decide they have to deal with it later since Jubilee is dying, which means this is their last chance to preserve Krakoa. Things are made even worse when Trask returns, somehow alive, and starts attacking everyone.  Jean goes to unleash the Phoenix Force, but Jubilee realizes that it could give her one last use of her resurrection powers. Jean warns Jubilee that this will probably erase her secondary mutation and all memories of her past lives, but Wolverine tells her that as long as the X-Men have a fighting chance, they'll figure something out.\nJubilee decides that it's worth the risk and, using the power of the Phoenix Force, resets the universe again. With no memories of her past life, she plays arcade games in a mall, hoping that she isn't a mutant.\nTHE FINAL DESTINY OF XCII?"

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nThe next question asked by the being is \"What's the most dangerous Venom out there?\" the Eventuality warned them that they were getting repetitive but then decided that it was natural for them to get curious. The Eventuality informed them that there was a scientist on Earth-71490 who asked that exact question and had it answered too before showing them.\nThe Eventuality then explains that he sent the V-Star Symbiote from its reality to Earth-71490 believing it could become that earth's lethal protector. He ponders on maybe if he was wrong and doomed the entire Multiverse but decides life is worth the risk. The Eventuality is then asked what if a more dangerous Venom isn't a more alien symbiote but a less human host, so they decide to take a look at the Venomsaurus Rex.\nThe Eventuality wonders if eating another dinosaur in the V-Rex's friend group counts as cannibalism given most of the friend group was made of other dinosaurs. The Eventuality then comes to the conclusion that it's still very rude to eat someone in your circle even if it isn't cannibalism but clarifies that's yet to happen yet as a human gets stepped on in that universe but it likely happens every day. The Eventuality is then asked if it is based on the universe in the first place, maybe a younger Venom would be worse.\nThe Eventuality then declares that Marcus Smith the Venom just seen is the worst Venom. However, he then notes that there are many bad Venoms and that if it weren't for him they would likely destroy the Multiverse. However, he notes that all the most dangerous universes don't have a Venom or King in Black they instead having something much worse, he then notes that the being in front of him has only two final questions.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nWeb-Weaver prepares to protect Doctor Stromm when he is stopped by Silk, Silk decides to tell Web-Weaver of his backstory. Long ago, his family entered into experimental technology in which a symbiote possessed their father, however the symbiote was too dangerous and killed Silk's mother and father and then possessed Silk and his sister Cindy. With their parents dead and a symbiote slowly to possess and corrupt them the company that was experimenting on their family took them in and experimented on them and the symbiote. Given Albert suffered the most under his, Cindy took majority of the load off of him, Albert later developed crime fighting abilities and took his mantel of Silk while Cindy became more powerful under her symbiote and began to change. Eventually Cindy was used in an attempt open a rtal to the V-Star symbiote's home-world but this seemingly killed both Cindy and the V-Star but Silk did not believe that.\nWeb-Weaver sympathized with Silk but still believed they needed to save the scientists V-Star was killing. However, before Web-Weaver could do anything, V-Star burst through the window holding the now deceased corpse of Mendel Stromm. V-Star was then attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D. and prepared to fight back despite being zapped by electricity until Silk told her not to. At which point V-Star flew away, when director Misty Knight asked what that was, Silk referred to V-Star as his protector.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nVenomsaurus Rex comically brags about having a symbiote, however aDromiceiomimusis concerned V-Rex could start to have urges to eat brains. V-Rex explains that he believes that's the best part, with the symbiote none of the brain-eating urges are his fault and therefore he gets a \"Get out of jail free card\". V-Rex then brags about having eaten brains much to the disturbance of his friend who begins to distance himself from him. V-Rex then makes multiple double meanings to get his friend to become his dinner but his friend is well aware of their meaning much to V-Rex's disappointment.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nOn Earth-197629, Venom is a hero known for being a bit lethal but he gets the job done having killed Captain America after his secret empire was revealed. However, some people are not convinced Venom is totally redeemed until at least he meets with his biggest fan, cancer patient Marcus Smith. Venom meets with Marcus and the two reminisce about Venom's past adventures like how he killed Spider-Man on Christmas and then cleaned up the remains of his corpse with a Zamboni. Marcus suggests he dig Spider-Man back up and kill him again. However, Venom believes digging someone back up to kill them again is Kraven's thing more so than Venom. Marcus then suggests Venom bonds with him to get rid of his sickness so the two can go on adventures together. Venom refuses given he's not one for sidekicks, Marcus then asks for Venom to at least bond a little to him which Venom decides to let happen.\nHowever, suddenly Venom begins to leave Eddie for Marcus at which point Marcus revealed he wasn't talking to Eddie but the symbiote. Venom leaves Eddie for Marcus given that he evidently sees he can conquer his true potential within the child. Marcus then rips the cancer out of himself and leaves it in Eddie, Marcus then leaves with the symbiote to do things Eddie supposedly couldn't do. J. Janet Jameson then says that Eddie can only be a hero if he meets with the child on the TV and Eddie remembering that he listened to her which led him to this mess curses at the TV.\nA VENOM FOR EVERY UNIVERSE!"

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nThe X-Men arrive on the Master Mold satellite to both destroy it and prevent Bolivar Trask from sending a signal. While Wolverine hunts down Trask, the other X-Men engage in battle with a bunch of Sentinels. Gambit accidentally kills himself and Rogue by blowing a hole in the satellite walls. Beast is killed soon after when the Blackbird spacecraft is destroyed, followed by Cyclops being obliterated by a laser beam. Wolverine confronts Trask and claims to want revenge for something terrible that happened to Jubilee, but Wolverine's gloating takes too long and Trask is able to send the signal before being killed. Sensing that they have failed, Jean Grey orders Magneto to destroy the satellite. He does so easily, but dies along with the remaining X-Men in the process.\nOn Earth, in New York's Krakoan Embassy, Psylocke explains to Robert Kelly, Vindicator, and Henry Peter Gyrich how the X-Men founded Krakoa as a safe-haven for all mutants without hurting any humans, and how they intend to keep that peace for everyone's future. The embassy is then attacked by the Friends of Humanity who still want to kill the mutants, so Psylocke calls in Cable and X-Force via a Krakoan portal to deal with them. She is then called back to Krakoa where the X-Men who died on the Master Mold satellite have been revived, thanks to the mutants' new Resurrection Protocols that let them cheat death. Xavier further explains that Krakoa is an island paradise for mutants, where old grudges are put aside and all are friends. Despite everybody else being happy about it, Wolverine is pissed off that it took the death of Jubilee to unite everyone.\nXavier and Magneto then go see Jubliee, who is hiding in a secret bunker after faking her death to unite everyone. She reveals that she's lived 10 lives, and every time the Orchis Protocols get set up, everything comes crashing down. In space, Trask, now in a Sentinel's body, has assembled Orchis, including Henry Peter Gyrich and Lady Deathstrike, to crush the mutants once and for all.\nTHE '90s ARE BACK — AGAIN!"

Original art by:Russ HeathandStan GoldbergRelease DateApril 22, 2025Cover DateApril,2025Issue DetailsOriginal Price$44.99Pages304ISBN979-8875000577\nPulp horror classics from the 1950s! Revenge, ghosts, locked rooms and killer ants, taken from early Marvel Comics series Men’s Adventures and Amazing Detective Cases.\nThe 1950s boom in horror comics saw Atlas Comics' entrée into the genre. Beginning in March 1952, Amazing Detective Cases began detailing cases where justice was served in supernatural fashion and beginning in May 1953, the adventures in Men’s Adventures were taken over by ghosts, murderous revenge, and psychological terror. The cream of Atlas’ artistic line-up — including recent EC stars and future Marvel staples – rose to the grisly challenge of the horror genre. Each issue is crammed with four condensed tales of creeping dread, ironic comeuppance, or startling twists, all from a different artist or team.\nAmong the short, sharp shocks included in this volume are the mini masterpieces \"The Eerie Escape\" by B. Krigstein, \"The Torture Master!\" by Russ Heath, The Drowning Witch\" by Reed Crandall and \"The 3rd Corpse\" by Bill Everett. Stories by Gene Colan, John Romita, Joe Sinnott, Dick Ayers, Jim Mooney, Paul Reinman and George Tuska, all of whom remained through the shift to Marvel Comics, additionally fill out these issues, along with Atlas regulars Fred Kida, Mort Lawrence, Mike Sekowsky and Myron Fass. Notably included is the first appearance of \"Gorilla Man\" by Robert Q. Sale, a character brought back in Marvel's contemporary Agents of Atlas series, and part of their ongoing continuity."

Gazing around at the horrors wrought byKnull'sinvasion of Earth, Peter Parker despairs that this is all his fault for having brought theVenom symbioteto Earth. Trying to avoid having a panic attack, Peter slams his fist into the wall of a rooftop exit as he thinks to himself that every death that Venom,Carnage, and the other symbiotes have caused is on him - and now the world is ending because he was patient zero for the symbiote invasion of Earth. As he gets himself under control, something swoops past and Peter turns to see a winged shape carrying an elderly woman in its talons. Pulling his torn mask back on, Spider-Man leaps into action - chastising himself for forgetting he's on the clock  and quipping that fighting asymbiote-dragonshouldn't be much different from fighting theVulture- which he's been doing since he was a teenager.\nCatching up to the winged shape, Spider-Man punches it... only to belatedly notice it's not a symbiote-dragon but the teenaged shapeshifterReptilin the form of aPteranodon. Catching Reptil and the elderly woman in a webbing net, Spider-Man apologizes for his mistake, the old woman - a Mrs. Volkov - furiously calling him a threat and a menace. Spider-Man asks what Reptil is doing in New York when last he'd heard he was a student at theAvengers Academy, but Reptil remarks the Academy has been closed for years. As Reptil remarks that it's Spider-Man's fault he's in New York, Peter's heart-rate spikes... until Reptil says that Spider-Man is one of his chief heroic inspirations, always looking out for the little guy. Reptil says one thing he learned fromHenry Pymwas to always be aware of his limitations, turning to indicate the symbiote-controlledCelestialstowering over the city and saying there's no way he could handle them. As Reptil says he's just a guy who can turn into dinosaurs, Spider-Man half-jokingly asks if he wants to trade power-sets; Reptil ignoring him and saying that what he learned from Spider-Man is that saving people is more important than fighting people. As they talk, Mrs. Volkov pulls out her smartphone and announces there's no signal; Reptil telling Spider-Man he's trying to get her to her home because that's what Spider-Man would do. Stunned and impressed, Spider-Man thinks to himself that there's nothing more he can do forEddieorDylan Brockbefore offering to help.\nWith Mrs. Volkov secured to Reptil's back with webbing, the two heroes set off across the city - Reptil asking if Spider-Man's sure he doesn't have anywhere more important to be. Spider-Man says Reptil is right that they need to be mindful of their capabilities before asking Mrs. Volkov where she lives. The elderly woman glares at him, Reptil remarking that she's a fan of the classicDaily Buglebefore asking Spider-Man where Staten Island is. Spider-Man is shocked, Reptil remarking that he's from Nevada and doesn't know his way around New York City. Spider-Man explains that Staten Island is five miles off the coast of Manhattan, Reptil remarking that he can fly them both there. Coming across a swarm of symbiote-dragons, Spider-Man thinks to himself that he was losing focus due to the overwhelming odds and that Reptil is right that he should concentrate on doing what he can. Blinding the symbiote-dragons with webbing, Spider-Man distracts them long enough for Reptil to get past them, snaring Reptil's talon with a web-line. Pulled along, Spider-Man thinks to himself that he's just a guy from Queens with radioactive spider-blood, but that even if this is all his fault he can do his part by helping those he can. Out over the New York Bay, Reptil asks Spider-Man for directions and Spider-Man points to the Staten Island ferry - thinking to himself that in the total darkness of Knull's symbiote-dome it's like flying in space, making the ferry's lights like a lighthouse beacon. As they draw closer, however, Spider-Man is horrified to realize they're not the only ones drawn to the ferry's lights: a colossal symbiote-dragon lands on the ferry and roars. As Reptil asks what they should do, Spider-Man thinks to himself that there's no way they can fight it before saying out loud that they have no choice but to fight it in order to save the people on the ferry.  Reptil says he can't turn into a flying creature big enough to fight the colossal symbiote-dragon, Spider-Man musing that aTyrannosaurus rexwouldn't work either given the harbor before coming up with an idea.\nTaking Mrs. Volkov, Spider-Man leaps down to the ferry and greets the crew, saying that he and Reptil are there to help. As the crew expresses incredulity as to what a kid who can turn into dinosaurs can do against the colossal symbiote-dragon, Reptil dives into the water and transforms into aMosasaurus- lunging up out of the water and chomping down on the colossal symbiote-dragon's neck before dragging it underwater. As the captain celebrates, Spider-Man says all Reptil did was buy them some time and that the only way to put the colossal symbiote-dragon down for good is with high voltages of electricity. The captain boasts that his ship is a brand-new Ollis-class ferry with four massive diesel engines and emergency generators capable of putting out 400,000 kilowatts; Spider-Man grinning and saying that'll do the trick. As they head below deck, the passengers accost them - demanding the captain launch the lifeboats to get them away from the monsters outside and disparagingly wondering what good a street-level hero like Spider-Man can do against the colossal symbiote-dragon. As Spider-Man's anxiety and PTSD start to overwhelm him, Mrs. Volkov shouts for the other passengers to shut up. The elderly woman states that Spider-Man could have decided to just save her and leave the colossal symbiote-dragon for the likes ofThororCaptain Marvelsince there was no way he could fight it on his own, but that to her surprise he told Reptil that they need to save as many people as possible.\nAs Spider-Man delivers a rousing speech and jury-rigs a harpoon to the ship's generators, the colossal symbiote-dragon overpowers Reptil'sMosasaurusform and takes a bite out of his neck before heading for the surface. As the colossal symbiote-dragon breaks the surface and glares at him, Spider-Man - thinking to himself that it's his responsibility to help clean up the mess he created and that he isn't afraid anymore - quotes Captain Ahab's last words fromMoby Dickbefore leaping into the colossal symbiote-dragon's gaping jaws. Spider-Man stabs the electrified harpoon into its tongue, causing it to destabilize and rupture - spattering the ferry with black ichor. As the captain celebrates, Spider-Man asks where Reptil is - the teenage hero landing on the deck and announcing he's still alive. As the two heroes congratulate each other, Mrs. Volkov says she's glad Reptil isn't seriously injured but that she'll be taking the ferry the rest of the way home. Taking a breather, Reptil asks Spider-Man what they do next, and Spider-Man says they go back out there and keep saving people.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nEvents:"

Hearing the sound of something hitting glass, Ben pulls back a sheet from a glass vitrine to reveal the symbiote, marvelling at the amorphous creature and wondering if it's alive. Entering the lab, Reed concurs -- though he doubts it's sentient -- and states that it is a symbiotic alien life form that was unwittingly brought to Earth by Spider-Man. Reed states that he decided to study the symbiote, the lab's new security protocols warding off attempted break-ins to steal it. Interrupting, Ben pointedly states that Reed forgot their anniversary, but Reed says he didn't -- he just decided to give Ben time to process things on his own time, having just recently returned from space. Shooting Reed an disbelieving look, Ben tells him to just admit he feels guilty for turning him into a monster. Turning to regard the symbiote, Ben sarcastically asks Reed why he doesn't stick him in a specimen cage too. Reed assures Ben that he's doing everything in his power to find a cure, but is interrupted by his wifeSue Storm, who informs him he's late for an interview. As he departs, Reed invites Ben to join the team for dinner, saying thatShe-Hulkis going to try making lasagna. Saying he'll check his schedule, Ben sighs dejectedly and laments to the symbiote that Reed will never understand what it's like being him. As Ben talks about how hurtful it is to be treated like a monster no matter how much good he does, the symbiote leers at him and then headbutts the side of the canister. As Ben says he can't let it out, the symbiote thinks to itself that despite his strong body Ben is weak inside -- the makings of a perfect host. Realizing the symbiote is offering to help him if he helps it, Ben opens the canister and it bonds to him.\nReturning to check on Ben, Reed is horrified at the sight of the symbiote-augmented Thing. Reaching for his sonic gun, Reed explains that when Spider-Man was its host the symbiote enhanced his powers but affected his mind. Retorting that the symbiote wants to help, Ben uses its shapeshifting powers to transform into his original human form. Despite Ben's elation, Reed raises the sonic gun and grimly says this isn't the way. As Reed opens fire, Ben leaps out of the way and transforms into his symbiote-enhanced form, furiously accusing Reed of letting his ego get in the way of his friend's happiness. As Reed protests that that's not true and the symbiote is infecting him, the Symbiote Thing snatches the sonic gun away and crushes it, snapping that this is the first time he's felt himself since the accident. Telling Reed to stay out of his way, Ben transforms into his human form and storms out of the lab.\nIn the sewers, theLizardsenses the symbiote has escaped captivity and sets out to find it.\nIn the Baxter Building, Reed remarks to Sue that the symbiote is somehow able to stabilize Ben's molecules to reverse his transformation, and that it should be possible to remove it without reversing the transformation. As Sue tells Reed to figure it out after they've saved their friend, Reed remarking that the symbiote taps into its host's subconscious desires, lamenting that if he removes it he'll be taking away the one thing that's fulfilled Ben's desire to look human again. Sue retorts that the symbiote makes Ben a danger to himself and others, and that it's their responsibility to stop him even if he hates them for it, though Reed laments that it's his responsibility to be a monster so his friend doesn't lose his humanity.\nRevelling in his return to human form, Ben cheerfully hits on attractive women and admires his reflection. The symbiote suddenly surges around Ben, alerting him to danger. Transforming into the Thing with the symbiote taking the shape of a sleeveless and legless uniform with a red spider emblem, Ben peers into a nearby alley as a sewer grate explodes skyward. As Ben prepares to fight, saying his foe is going to be sorry, the Lizard emerges and says the only thing he's sorry about is how the Fantastic Four have treated Ben. Bemused by the sudden appearance of one of Spider-Man's enemies, Ben resolves himself to fight and attacks despite the Lizard protesting that he just wants to talk. Punched into a wall, the Lizard hisses that his reptilian minions have told him all about how Ben is reviled as a monster and unloved even by the man who created him. As Ben grabs him by the throat and prepares to punch him in the face, the Lizard says that the Fantastic Four lied to him and only keep him around because they're afraid of him. As Ben stammers that the Lizard doesn't know that, Curt Connors' reptilian alter ego chuckles bitterly and says that people fear him based on his scales, fangs, claws, and tail, and reject him even when he tries to do good -- asking Ben if that sounds familiar. Ben snaps that Dr. Connors has hurt people both as a human and a humanoid reptile, releasing him and saying they're nothing alike. The Lizard retorts that the Thing will never be accepted as a hero without the Fantastic Four at his side, saying that he started with good intentions -- developing a means for amputees to regenerate lost limbs -- and succeeded by using himself as a test subject, even if he's rejected as a monster. The Lizard says he still wants to help people despite the world fearing and hating him, and that in the right hands Ben's symbiote could provide a cure for thousands of people.\nAs Ben thinks it over, the Lizard says that it sensed something special about Spider-Man's new suit on Battleworld but wasn't sure what it was until now, asking Ben to help him help people by sharing his gift. Descending into the Lizard's lair in the sewers, Ben enters a machine as the Lizard boots it up. Disparaging Reed Richards, the Lizard activates the machine, which separates the symbiote from Ben and sucks it up. Horrified, Ben says the Lizard said he wanted to use the symbiote to help others; the Lisard replying that he didn't lie -- he just meant himself. Saying he will give the world a reason to fear and hate him, the Lizard bonds to the symbiote.\nAt the Baxter Building, Sue suggests Reed call inJohnny Stormor She-Hulk instead of trying to do everything alone. Repairing the sonic gun, Reed says it has to be him, but Sue calls him out on being irrational. Their argument is interrupted by an alarm, and as Reed tries to get a visual feed of the intruder the Venomized Lizard bursts into the lab and collapses the floor. With Sue dazed and Reed distracted, the Lizard pounces on him and begins savagely beating him. Sue tries to defeat the Venomized Lizard with her powers, but he regenerates from her attacks and kills her. Grebbing Reed by the throat, the Lizard mocks him for having assumed he was the smartest scientist in Battleworld. In the sewers, Ben transforms back into the Thing and escapes, arriving just in time to see the Lizard bite off Reed's arm when he tries to throttle him into unconsciousness. Sneering that the Thing is too late, the Venomized Lizard bites off Reed's head. Horrified by the death of his friend, Ben apologizes for not having listened and for being so hard on him, the Venomized Lizard saying that Reed deserved to die for his selfishness and that he and Ben are better off now. His sorrow turning to rage, Ben declares that the Fantastic Four is no more and tackles the Venomized Lizard out the window. As they fall, the symbiote leaves the Lizard and rebonds to Ben, smug that it's succeeded in breaking and corrupting him. Impacting the ground, the symbiote-enhanced Thing picks up the Lizard by the head, Dr. Connors realizing his intent and saying it's not what Reed would want. Retorting that Reed's gone, the Thing crushes the Lizard's head and fully succumbs to the symbiote's influence. As the NYPD arrive, the Venomized Thing bares his fangs and lets out a roar.\nWHAT IF…BEN GRIMM BECAME VENOM?\n• When BEN GRIMM returns to Earth after his exploration of space post-SECRET WARS, he finds that the FANTASTIC FOUR has trapped a helpless Klyntar symbiote in Reed’s lab!\n• But is that symbiote really helpless? Or is it truly one of the most dangerous symbiotes in the galaxy?"

The man at the desk tells her he can't give her an ID, as she has not presented anymore identification. and that if she can't he's gonna have to ask her to leave. Suddenly, robbers appear and, despite being told by the TVA not to use her suit or her powers, she does both and defeats the robbers earning the praise of the civilians. Gwen then heads back to the apartment, but as she does footage is caught of her confusing the Spider-Heroes of Earth-616, who wonder what she's doing on Earth-616. Upon arriving back on the apartment, she runs into Ouroborous, or \"O.B.\" for short. O.B. reminds her of what they discussed before taking her to Earth-616.\nGwen tells him that she tried but that the suit has sort of a symbiotic feature, as it has mind of its own. O.B. suggests telling the suit the same thing he told her. Gwen also complains about having to use the alias \"Lisa Rogers\", as it feels like using a superhero alias while in a civilian life. O.B. understands and tells her he'll see what she can do, but reminds her one last time that under no circumstances can she use the suit, or else people will die. Gwen tries not to use the suit only to see a truck of armed robbers, and decides that she has no choice. Before going to stop them, though, she makes the rational that O.B. only told her not to use it on armed robbers, but said nothing of armed trucks, therefore finding a loophole.\nShe stops the truck, but is attacked by the Last Son of Kraven, who shoots her with a dart. Confused, Gwen recalls hearing that Kraven was dead, unaware that this is Kraven's clone/son. The two fight, but Gwen finds the dart is slowing her down and begins to hallucinate her Earth-616 counterpart's death. As she realizes that this is the very place her counterpart died, she is stabbed by Kraven, who hurls her over the bridge. As Gwen dies, she notes that her Earth-616 counterpart was loved and remembered, while she'll be dead and forgotten. As she sinks, an unknown person pulls her out of the water.\nTRAPPED IN THE 616…FOR GOOD!"

The particular pheromone he used is the flight-scent pheromone, which stimulates fear reactions in herd animals. He tailored it for human beings, dubbed himself Mister Fear and became criminal.[1]\nDrago was later killed byStarr Saxon, who took away Fear Gas and used it for a short time before seemingly dying.[2]The Gas was then obtained byLarry Cranston[3]and later by his nephew,Alan Fagan. All three of them assumed identity of Mister Fear and used Fear Gas to commit crimes.\nLarry Cranstoneventually developed power to induce fear even without using the Gas.[4]\nFear Inducement:This drug induces severe anxiety, fear, and panic in humans who inhaled it, rendering them incapable of fighting or resisting. The drug is most commonly used in the form of gas pellets shot from a gun. The pellets rupture on contact, releasing the flight scent, which is inhaled by the victim. The dosage contained in one pellet is enough to incapacitate a normal adult male for about 15 minutes, or an exceptionally fit male, such as Daredevil, for about five minutes. The side effects of anxiety, edginess, and mild nausea can persist for several days.[6]"

When they were teenagers, MJ suggested that she and Gwen establish a band together to become rich and famous, and was dismayed by Gwen - who had recently become the superheroSpider-Woman- not paying attention to her.[7]During her senior year of high-school, MJ got into a fight withGlory Grantthat resulted in them sharing detention together.[8]Inspired by their mutual love of music, MJ and Glory founded a rock band called theMary Janesalongside Gwen andBetty Brant;[9]though MJ's harsh temper and arrogance caused friction, particularly between herself and Glory.[2]When Gwen didn't show up for the Mary Janes' first performance at their senior prom due to fighting theLizardas Spider-Woman, MJ was deeply hurt and assumed Gwen no longer cared about their promise to become famous together.[7]\nAt some point, MJ dated a boy but broke up with him over their differing tastes in music. She was also formerly friends withLiz Allanbefore her unwittingly smug and self-absorbed attitude caused a falling out when MJ tried to inform Liz that her boyfriend had been attempting to cheat on her.[10]FollowingRandy Robertson- the Mary Janes' manager - bringingFelicia Hardyin as a second vocalist, Mary Jane got into an altercation with her and was nearly strangled with a mic cord.[11]She and the other Mary Janes also participated in a charity wrestling match againstJen Walters.[12]\nMary Jane's frustration with Gwen spacing out during practice and being late to the opening of their first major concert - which was crashed by theRhinoattempting to carry out a hit on Gwen's fatherGeorge- led to the latter quitting the band.[2]While the attack led to a surge in the band's popularity, MJ's stubbornly refused to swallow her pride and ask Gwen to come back, leading to Glory quitting as well.[5]When Gwen was found half-conscious in a bar by Randy, MJ accompanied the other bandmates to check on her, but her resentment over Gwen having seemingly bailed on the band's first major gig led to a vehement argument with Glory. With Gwen and Glory both eventually rejoining the band,[13]Mary Jane swallowed her pride and set up a gig headlining for Felicia Hardy's new band in order to piggyback off Felicia's success; though the gig turned out to be a disaster whenninjaled byMatt Murdockattacked. Despite deeply resenting Felicia, MJ fought back to back with her until Spider-Woman arrived and drove the ninja off.[11]\nMary Jane was the first of the Mary Janes to figure out Gwen was Spider-Woman after watching her throwFrank Castlethrough a window;[14]though to her annoyance Gwen - who had lost her powers by that point and was dependent on a limited supply of power-ups - repeatedly refused to admit the truth or engage in superheroics.[15]The other members of the Mary Janes initially dismissed MJ's theory as ridiculous until she was able to definitively prove it by texting Gwen's cellphone while Spider-Woman was on live TV.[16]With Gwen busy superheroing inMadripoor, MJ asked Glory to perform as the band's drummer at their next gig - leading to an argument where Glory once again threatened to quit once the gig was over. On the way to the gig, MJ had an awkward run-in with her ex-boyfriend, who requested she return some records he'd loaned her while they were dating. After doing so, Mary Jane punched out a boy who was harassing Betty Brant, causing Glory to develop a crush on her.[10]At some point following this incident, MJ and Glory entered into a romantic relationship.\nFollowing Gwen's stint in prison for her vigilantism, Mary Jane regrouped the band with plans to go on-tour,[17]though her perfectionism and determination to recapture the Mary Janes' former glory clashed with Gwen's PTSD and she was unamused by Gwen's idea to become a hero for hire.[18]As the band's next big gig approached, MJ's frustration and anxiety over their comeback - as well as jealousy of Gwen's superpowers - led to her lashing out at Gwen during practise, even accusing her of trying to usurp leadership of the Mary Janes when a piece of Gwen's malfunctioningsymbioteaccidentally latched onto her.[19]The Mary Janes' next gig was thrown into chaos whenMan-Wolf's gang bombed the venue, Gwen saving Mary Jane from being crushed by falling debris.[20]\nMary Jane was furious when Gwen informed the band she had decided to start attending university in an alternate reality -Earth-616, chastising Gwen that the band needed her and leaving Gwen dismayed that she wasn't more understanding;[6]though she later began making an effort to keep her temper in-check.[21]When Gwen was late for band practice - having been kidnapped by theJackalof Earth-616, who had followed her into Earth-65 - MJ tracked her location via her phone and led the other members of the band in stormingMan-Wolf's hideout. MJ was promptly taken hostage, but used her self-defence training to break free and help Gwen subdue the Jackal, expressing irritation at Gwen's superheroing once again interfering with band practice. To make it up to MJ, Gwen took her and the other Mary Janes toEarth-817, attending concerts by alternate-universe versions of their favorite bands.[22]\nSometime after Gwen was exiled to Earth-616 bySueandJohnnyStorm,[23]MJ and the other Mary Janes were captured by the Jackal, who bonded a sample of Gwen's symbiote to MJ in the hopes of luring her back to Earth-65. Coincidentally, at that exact moment Gwen attempted to use herTicket to the Multiverseto return to Earth-65 in order to escape anattack on the Earthby the dark elder godKnull. Instead of opening a portal to Earth-65, the amulet summoned MJ to Earth-616 using her and Gwen's shared symbiote as a conduit. Confused, Gwen grabbed MJ in order to break her fall, but the two of them landed in a puddle ofliving abyssand MJ was immediately taken over. Willingly succumbing to Knull's will, MJ was dubbedCarnagein honor of the lateCletus Kasady, and was commanded to kill Gwen and take her artificial symbiote for the dark god to study.[4]\nTransforming an electric guitar into a battle-axe, Carnage rebuked Ghost-Spider's attempts to talk her down, sneering that Gwen felt threatened now that she wasn't the only one with superpowers and accusing her of having made the world worse for her so-called friends before abandoning them by jumping ship to a different universe. Briefly restrained by Gwen, Carnage mocked her for assuming her symbiote - which was comprised of the sample of Gwen's symbiote mixed with Knull's living abyss - still belonged to her; slamming Gwen into a pool of living abyss so that Knull could seize control of her as well. Gwen managed to break free and renewed her attempts to talk MJ down, Carnage mocking her for not being willing to fight back until she touched a nerve. As they brawled, Carnage disregarded Gwen's warning that her symbiote - which was partially comprised of Gwen's own - would kill her; though Gwen briefly managed to get through to MJ by begging her not to let the symbiote eat her alive. The Carnage symbiote reasserted its control over her, and Carnage accused Gwen of trying to trick her into depowering herself. Realizing Gwen might be right, Carnage noted that since she may not have much time left she shouldn't waste it fighting Gwen, web-swinging away in search of innocent people to slaughter in the name of Knull.[7]\nSarcastically flirting with Ghost-Spider, Carnage began abducting people to create a new band. Following her toMadison Square Garden, Ghost-Spider challenged her to a battle of the bands and used the sound waves to destabilize MJ's bond to her symbiote enough to force its gummy spiders to attack the living abyss corrupting them, causing it to separate from MJ. Groaning that she didn't feel so good, MJ passed out in Ghost-Spider's arms and Gwen attempted to open a portal to Earth-65 to take her home. When this failed due to Knull's presence, Gwen carried MJ to safety and promised to find a way to heal her - not noticing MJ still had some of the Carnage symbiote in her.[24]\nAt some point, Gwen and MJ returned to Earth-65 and Gwen resumed her previous status quo of superheroing and attending university in Earth-616, annoying MJ -- who wanted to renew focus on the Mary Janes. When the time- and dimension-travelling supervillain Finale attempted to duplicate herself throughout theTimestreamas variants ofThor,Captain America,Wolverine,Iron Man, andCaptain Marvel, Gwen'sTicket to the Multiverseresulted in her being affected instead -- turningEarth-65into a dystopian reality. MJ's personality was radically altered, making her more openly affectionate towards Gwen, but when confronted by the rewritten George Stacy - now a ruthless police officer - she immediately sold Gwen out.[25]\nReturned to normal by Gwen's restoration of the multiverse,[26]Em Jay returned to her usual routine of venting her crush on Gwen into her songs and attempting to wrangle a successful gig for the band. Frustrated by Gwen ruining another gig while saving her from a would-be supervillain, Em Jay nevertheless invited her to tour with the Mary Janes when they were asked to front for theUncut Gems, on the condition that Gwen not get up to any superhero antics. Afterthe Hulkcrashed the concert, Em Jay attempted to steal one ofDazzler's bejewelled microphones but was caught by Gwen. Em Jay's attempt at being heartfelt towards Gwen was interrupted by the Uncut Jems' managerNatasha Romanoff, who dragged Gwen away for a private conversation.[27]\nLearning that Gwen had agreed to help Dazzler catch a stalker as Ghost Spider, Em Jay was furious that she'd gone back on her word. While Glory was able to calm her down, Natasha dragged Gwen away once the two bands arrived at their next gig. In order to smooth over Em Jay's bruised ego, Dazzler recruited her as the Uncut Gems' guitarist to replace Rick, who'd been a no show for their previous concert. WhenPixie--a former friend of the Dazzler--and the Hulk attacked, Em Jay was affected by Pixie's hallucinogenic dust and distraught to learn Gwen had been buried in concrete and was relieved to learn Gwen was OK.[28]\nNot long after, Glory--frustrated by Em Jay pining after Gwen--broke up with her. While following Gwen, Em Jay was grabbed by Pixie and taken toBruce Banner, a mad scientist who was obsessed with the Dazzler and had been behind the attacks on her. Commiserating with Em Jay's unrequited feelings for Gwen and comparing them to his own for the Dazzler, Banner used hisgamma radiationtechnology to reactivate the dormant Carnage symbiote inside her.[29]When Dazzler escaped, Carnage--jealous over her having \"stolen\" Gwen--attacked her, only to be confronted by Ghost-Spider. Carnage quickly overpowered Gwen, berating her for having been oblivious to Em Jay's feelings, but was stopped from getting revenge by Banner's benevolent Hulk form, who seemingly burned the Carnage symbiote out of Em Jay's body. Em Jay and Gwen later reconciled, but this was interrupted by the Carnage symbiote revealing it had survived.[1]\nArrogant, hot-tempered, and self-absorbed, Mary Jane Watson is driven to make the Mary Janes a success and harshly critical of anything she sees as an obstacle to this -- namely Gwen Stacy's chronic tardiness.[31]MJ was the first of her friends to deduce that Gwen was Spider-Woman, the others not believing her until she was able to definitively prove it.[8][16]Despite her self-absorbed and vitriolic attitude - which has led to falling-outs with several of her friends,[10]MJ is staunchly loyal to and protective of the people she cares about - punching out a boy who was harassing Betty Brant,[10]and attacking a man who accused Gwen of being Spider-Woman.[32]\nMJ's harsh attitude towards Gwen stems from feeling neglected by her when they'd been friends since the sixth grade,[7]jealousy over Gwen having superpowers,[19]and an unrequited crush on her that she vents using her music.[3][33]When bonded to theCarnage symbiote, all of MJ's suppressed rage, jealousy, and resentment erupted to the surface and she willingly embracedKnull's dark influence in exchange for the power she had craved and the chance to take revenge on Gwen for having abandoned her.[7]"

When Knull and his horde of symbiotic dragons reachEarth's orbit,Iron Mandetonates the leftover armada ofAllianceships, but they fail to even slow down the incoming threat. Eddie locks his sonDylaninside the bunker ofSims Towerfor his protection. As the dragons rain down onManhattan, they explode on impact and cover the city in symbiotic matter.Captain Americaassembles a street-level team to evacuate civilians. TheX-Menarrive to offer reinforcements, withStormusing her electricity powers to take down the dragons.\nVenom reaches the spire established underneath the subway byCarnageduring his assault on New York to control his horde and attempts to turn any dragons broken out of Knull's hive to the heroes' side. The heroes are ultimately overpowered when Knull himself arrives, heralded by a trio of symbiote-controlledCelestials. TheSentryis dispatched to destroy Knull, but the God of the Symbiotes quickly turns the tables and kills the Sentry instead, absorbing theVoidfrom within him. Knull then subdues the heroes in the ground with symbiote matter and forms a symbiotic dome around the entirety of the planet, blocking out theSun. Storm is also overpowered and defeated. Eddie Brock decides to call out to Knull, and is taken to the top of the symbiote-coveredEmpire State Building. Revealing that he is after Dylan, Knull strips theVenom symbioteoff Eddie and absorbs it. He the lets go of Eddie, sending him plummeting to the streets far below.\nStanding on the roof of a high rise overlooking the nighttime cityscape ofManhattan,Eddie Brocksenses thatKnullhas finally arrived. Contacting theAvengers, Eddie alerts them to implement the plans they developed and leaps off the roof, transforming intoVenom. Arriving at the penthouse where he's been staying, Eddie gazes down at his sleeping son,Dylan, and laments having passed down a legacy of darkness and death to him. Rousing him, Eddie starts to explain what's going on but Dylan says he can sense Knull's presence.\nAt theAvengers Mountain,Captain Americabarks orders as he,Iron Man,Hulk (Jen Walters)andCaptain Marvelwatch a set of screens monitoring Earth's orbit for any sign ofKnull's horde. Iron Man remarks that based on the intel Venom gave them, Knull and the symbiotes don't emit heat signatures to track, but that either way they'll run into the derelictKreeandSkrullwarships left behind by thewaragainst theCotati- which he's turned into a makeshift minefield. Smirking, Captain America remarks that Tony just likes turning things into bombs, Tony asking if he's heard any intel from their secret weapon. Captain Marvel interrupts, saying that they've got incoming as countlessSymbiote Dragonsemerge from the depths of space and soar into the minefield. Grinning wickedly, Iron Man detonates the ships... but his triumphant boast trails off as he sees the massive explosions only managed to destroy a few hundred of the hundred-thousands of symbiote dragons. Descending a flight of stairs followed by Dylan, Eddie staggers as he feels the dragons' pain and rage through the Venom symbiote, who urges him to hurry. Bolting from the control room, Captain America orders all teams to move out immediately - the Avengers andFantastic Fourarriving in Manhattan to see symbiote dragons falling from the sky like a torrential downpour.\nAs Eddie leads Dylan to the bunkerEzekiel Simshad built - on loan courtesy ofSpider-Man- Dylan protests that he can help fight and try to use his powers to turn Knull's horde against him, but Eddie refuses to put his son in harm's way. As the bunker's door closes, Dylan tearfully asks Eddie to come home safely, Eddie responding that he loves his son. Captain America contacts Eddie over a comm unit and tells him it's time for Plan B, Eddie mentally noting that means all hell's broken loose.\nSymbiote dragons soar through the skies over Manhattan as living abyss encases the skyscrapers and high rises of the city. On the ground, the Avengers work withDoctor Strangeand street level heroes - particularly those with electricity-based powers, likeLightning- to evacuate civilians as symbiotes rain from the sky and flood the streets with living abyss. Eddie notes that Knull's only known weaknesses are electricity, cosmic powers, and maybe magic; leaving them short-staffed. Captain America radios Iron Man and asks if he's heard any word fromThor, informing him that many of the dragons are exploding into a deluge of symbiotes that sooner or later will seek out hosts. Remarking that he hasn't, Iron Man notifies them that their other heavy-hitter is en route, but Captain America snaps that they need backup immediately.Professor Xtelepathically cuts in on the conversation and offers the aid of theX-Men, deployingCyclops,Storm,Cable,Marvel Girl,Wolverine,Nightcrawler, andMagnetoinWashington Square Park. As Xavier lauds Storm - apotheosized into agoddessof the sky - as a suitable substitute for Thor, Ororo snaps at him that she needs to concentrate as she blasts symbiote dragons with lightning.\nNoting that Thor and now Storm were supposed to be the second phase of Plan B, Venom makes his way through the sewers to the ruins of the Spire -Dark Carnage's lair - to initiate the third phase. As Venom locates Kasady's throne of living abyss and connects to it, Eddie mentally notes that the second phase of Plan B was to use heavy hitters like Thor and Storm to sever Knull's connection to as many of the symbiote dragons as possible, with the third phase being Venom seizing control of them himself using the throne - though Eddie notes it's equally possible that Knull will sense them right away and seize control of the Venom symbiote again.\nIn the streets above, Doctor Strange verbally, mentally, and mystically calls out for backup as the symbiote dragons chew through his defensive spells as quickly as he can cast them, Storm likewise calling out for assistance as she is overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Eddie protests that he's almost through to the core of the Hive Mind, Iron Man urging him to hurry as Doctor Strange is swallowed whole by one of the dragons. Breaking through, Eddie reacts in horror and tells everyone they need to flee immediately and that the symbiote dragons are the least of their worries: en route to Earth, Knull settled his eons-old grudge against theCelestialsand took them over with symbiotes. A trio of symbiote-possessed Celestials - among themArishem the JudgeandTefral the Surveyor- appear in the sky over Manhattan and touch down. Tefral's chest opens and Knull himself emerges, brandishing hisNecroswordand calmly declaring his intent to destroy Earth, adding that in the meantime he is looking for a human named Brock and is willing to make their deaths quick and painless if they surrender. As Captain America orders his team to fall back, Knull manifests draconic wings from his symbiote-armor and swoops towards them, mockingly calling them a welcoming party for his coronation and asking who they all are. As Iron Man informs him that their secret weapon is ready and waiting for orders, Captain America retorts that normally they're the last thing supervillains like Knull ever see, but that today they're going to sit back and watch.\nOn Captain America's command,the Sentry- restored to his original golden form - dives out of the sky and punches through Tefral's head. Enraged, Knull wheels around to face the interloper, but the Sentry grabs him and ascends to the edge of space, calmly introducing himself as he attempts to rip Knull in half like he once did to Carnage. Easily overpowering the Sentry and reversing their positions, Knull sneers that he already knows who he is - remarking that the Hive has memories of him once killing Carnage. As Knull grabs his face, the Sentry eyes turn black with glowing red irises as theVoidattempts to take over him. The Sentry snaps at Knull to stop lest the dark entity inside him be unleashed, but Knull rips the Sentry in half - in the same way the Sentry had once killedAres- and the Void bursts from his corpse. Declaring that he is the Lord of the Abyss and that the darkness inside the Sentry bows to him, Knull grins wickedly and absorbs the Void into himself.\nAs Venom and Captain America react in disbelief and horror, Iron Man urges Captain America to retreat immediately, but Captain America declares his intent to sacrifice himself holding the line. Knull interrupts his heroic speech, mockingly asking if that was the best they could come up with and remarking that he's disappointed, having been expecting a difficult battle with worthy opponents. Raising his hand, Knull causes the living abyss covering the ground to engulf the heroes and claim them for his army - with only a few such as Spider-Man escaping. Raising his hand, Knull shapes the horde of symbiote dragons into a Dyson Sphere of living abyss that encases the entire Earth, cutting it off from the Sun and the stars. Blasting lightning omnidirectionally, Storm demands to know what's going on and Iron Man informs her of what just happened. Turning his attention to the sky-goddess, Knull manifests a massive hand of living abyss and snatches her from the sky, claiming her for his horde as well. As Professor X sits in shocked silence, Iron Man contacts Venom and demands to have some good news.\nDisconnecting from Dark Carnage's throne, Eddie replies that he and the Venom symbiote are going to try a hail mary plan: giving Knull what he wants. As Iron Man protests that Knull will destroy the world either way, Eddie says they'll try to buy him some time to come up with a way to win. Removing his comm unit and tossing it aside, Eddie asks the Venom symbiote if it's ready for one last dance. Saying that it is, the Venom symbiote tells Eddie that no matter what it loves him, and connects to Knull's Hive Mind. Grinning, Knull plunges the massive hand of living abyss through the street - ripping through the roof of the Spire and grabbing Venom. Perched on the roof of the abyss-encrusted Empire State Building, Knull grabs Venom by the throat and gloats that the world of darkness he has created is so much more beautiful than the Light. Venom offers to serve Knull if he spares the Earth, but Knull remarks that he recognizes Eddie as the one who killed theGrendeland growls that he thought he'd already killed him. As Knull chuckles to himself and remarks that minds are funny like that, Eddie asks what he means. Knull remarks that he should have specified that the Brock he wanted wasn't Eddie but Dylan. Horrified and furious, Eddie begs Knull to leave his son alone and take him instead. Knull pretends to contemplate Eddie's offer before refusing and ripping the Venom symbiote off him, absorbing it into his own symbiote as he says he's taking his child back and will take Eddie's from him as well. Remarking that he no longer has any use for Eddie, Knull lets go and sends him plunging towards the symbiote-covered streets below.\nDARKNESS REIGNS!\nAfter a campaign across the galaxy, Knull’s death march arrives to Earth and, worse yet, he hasn’t come alone! With an army of hundreds of thousands of symbiote dragons at his command, the King in Black is a force unlike any Earth’s heroes have ever faced. Eddie Brock AKA Venom has seen firsthand the chaos that even one of Knull’s symbiotic monsters can wreak – will he survive an encounter with the God of the Abyss himself?"

Bucky finds himself captured and taken to the Red Skull, however Cap manages to track them down and fight them off until they retreat.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nWith this fact cleared up, the Red Skull decides to tell Captain America his life's story:The young boy who would one day become the Red Skull was an orphan who lived on the streets and had to steal to survive. Finding himself in and out of jail and working as cheap labour, this young man would grow up full of hatred for others. During the rise of the Nazi party to power, the young boy was a bell hop for a hotel. One night, the young bell hop happened to have the opportunity to wait on Adolf Hitler, who was staying there. Realizing the boy's hatred and potential, Hitler took the boy under his wing and trained him to be his greatest soldier, eventually earning the costume and title of the Red Skull. A figure, that even Adolf Hitler would come to fear.\nThe Skulls story is interrupted when Cap tries to escape, however, the Red Skull easily knocks him down and continues his story.\nFrom there he spoke of how during the early days of the war, he had managed to spread destruction and terror wherever he went. Slowly eliminating all who's ranks were above him until he was second only to Hitler himself.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nMeanwhile, Bucky, who was also captured by the Nazi's is about to be executed by a Nazi firing squad, however their guns weren't loaded and it was all a cruel joke, leaving them to wonder when they will really be executed. However, this never happens, as Bucky leads a rebellion which allows the prisoners and himself to get free. Bucky then begins searching around the Nazi base to find Cap.\nElsewhere, the Red Skull has brought Captain America to Hitler to show him that Cap is now fully under his control. Convinced, Hitler then orders an attack on London. Learning of the Nazi's plot, Bucky knocks out a Nazi soldier and takes his place on the plane. Landing in London which is in the midst of an air strike, the Nazi soldiers parachute onto British soil. There, Bucky tries to talk sense into Cap, however, he is taken down by a bunch of Nazi soldiers while Cap is ushered onward. Bucky manages to fight them off and chase after Cap.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nWord gets back to the Red Skull who has one of his operatives that is in a POW camp initiate a new plan against the Allies. The plan, dubbed \"Project Vanish\" was implemented by the Skull himself.\nAt this camp, the chosen soldier orchestrates events so that he is a lone prisoner taken under the care of an army troop for relocation (coincidentally the same troupe that Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes are a part of.) Using hidden gas canisters to escape, the Nazi flees into the woods and finds the cabin which contains the secret weapon that is part of Project Vanish, a disintegration ray."

The Hulk angrily pounds on the glass and manages to crack it. Bruce notes the Hulk has been banging on the mirror for the last two days and this is the first time he's been able to affect it. Bruce hasn't let the Hulk out since his fight with Sasquatch. His recollection of the event is hazy, but he knows the Hulk absorbed Sasquatch's gamma energy into himself, and he suspects whatever was possessing Walter Langkowski came with it. On the other side of the mirror, the Hulk confronts his own reflection: Brian Banner.\nBruce decides he needs to speak with the Hulk. Using a technique known as \"automatic writing,\" Bruce empties his mind and lets his unconscious write him a message. It's a single word: Home.\nCalifornia\nBetty Ross-Banner watches a news report about the Hulk's recent battle with Sasquatch in Minnesota. Betty tells herself that it isn't really Bruce; he would have called her once he came back from the dead if it was. She turns off her TV and begins to cry.\nElsewhere\nSix figures at an undisclosed location called Shadow Base monitor the Hulk's allies, including Betty, Leonard Samson, Skaar, and Rick Jones' gravesite. The monitors are hanging upside down, they have wires protruding from their empty eye sockets, and large cables attached directly to the backs of their heads. One of the monitors expresses that he's starting to feel like a \"creep\". His words are cut short by his boss, General Reginald Fortean, who dismisses the monitor from duty and makes it clear to the rest that the Hulk's allies are the enemy.\nFortean converses with a Dr. Clive. Clive asks if General Thaddeus Ross would mind Shadow Base keeping tabs on his daughter, if he knew. Fortean explains to Clive that it isn't Ross's business to know as Ross is too close to the Hulk. Fortean also states that the General is better off dealing with the current situation with Captain America and leave control of Shadow Base in the hands of a second-in-command, which, as Clive puts it, gives him plausible deniability. Fortean tells Clive that Ross once became a Hulk himself, an act that almost lead to victory over his enemy. Fortean believes that the General only made one mistake: he thought he could defeat the Hulk with only one monster.\nFortean and Clive enter a lab where tests are being conducted on Del Frye, who is being contained in a large tank. Clive asks Dr. McGowan for an update on Frye's condition. She informs him that Frye is in agony, but with some modifications to the tank mix, his pain can be reduced or even eliminated. Clive tells her to forget about his pain and instead asks Jase where they're at with replicating Frye. Jase says that the gamma serum in Frye's blood is far too complex to figure out on their own. Clive explains to Fortean that without a Hulk to study they can't make any progress. Fortean states they don't yet have the resources to capture the Hulk. Clive clarifies that they don't needtheHulk, but ratheraHulk, preferably one no one would miss.\nFortean asks where Walter Langkowski was taken after the battle in Minnesota.\nAlpha Flight Space Station\nOn the Alpha Flight Space Station, Walter gets examined by Shaman. He reiterates that Shaman had already told him that Tanaraq was gone and the Great Beasts were inactive. He reveals the reason why he tried to find Bruce was because he thought the monster he saw in the mirror was psychological in nature, like the Hulk. Walter says that, unlike the Hulk, he would never choose to hurt anyone. Jackie McGee, there because she was a witness to Walter's stabbing, expresses doubt, citing Walter's efforts to specifically turn himself into a Hulk. Everything that's happened thus far was because Walter made that choice.\nPuck asks about the stabbing. According to Jackie, the attack felt \"too random,\" and that the two bar patrons that started the fight were calm when she and Walter walked in, but seemed to get more aggressive in Walter's presence. Walter angrily accuses Jackie of blaming him for his own death, but Shaman disagrees. He theorizes that the thing that stole Walter's body is a being far worse than Tanaraq, a being he dubs the \"One Below All\", described as the opposite face of creation.\nJackie is doubtful about Shaman's theory, and asks if he understands how it would sound to a jury, but Puck assures her that dark forces do exist, as he met them in person. Captain Marvel enters the room and tells Jackie she does understand her reasoning. She asks Jackie to leave the room because she wants to talk to Walter. Carol tells him that she was just speaking to General Fortean, who had threatened Walter with extradition, trial, and possibly death by lethal injection. Fortunately, the General can get Walter exonerated if Carol and her team capture the Hulk, as they have gamma-radiation equipment able to find traces of Banner's signature. Shaman remarks that without Sasquatch, Alpha Flight is incapable of dealing with such a task. Carol agrees, but also thinks that herotherteam can.\nIowa\nBruce walks along a country road in Iowa, hitchhiking his way \"home\": Hulk needs his place of power, so that he will be able to beat the thing that infested him. Carol shows up behind Bruce with the rest of the Avengers. He asks her if this is a social call, or if she's there on business. Carol tells him that while the Hulk has saved the world in the past, which has earned him a lot of rope, the Avengers have changed, and his rope is about to run out.\nBruce spots Jennifer Walters and says he's disappointed in her. She explodes at him, ranting about how he had himself killed while she was in a come, knowing full well what that would do to her, and also blaming him for what he made Clint Barton, a dear friend to the Hulk, do. She starts to turn into She-Hulk but is calmed down by Thor. Carol assures Bruce that they don't want to hurt him, but he needs to come with them. Bruce lets her know that it's night time; the night is his time.\nCarol reveals she knows all about the Hulk's new method of transformation and she has no intention of killing him. Bruce responds with \"That's my secret, Captain. I'm already dead.\" With that, Bruce instantly transforms into the Hulk.\n“THE GREEN DOOR” STARTS HERE!\n• Bruce Banner is alive — and everyone knows it. Now he’s hunted by the government, Alpha Flight, the mysterious Shadow Base...and the Avengers. And someone’s going to find him first.\n• But Bruce has bigger problems. Something terrible has infected him. Something with unspeakable plans for humanity. And the only one who knows about it..."

During a tour to a garden holding monuments to the fallenCaptain Britain Corps, Elizabeth and Saturnyne begin arguing over theCaptain Britain Corpsinadvertently created by Jamie and whether or not they qualify as a new corps, as Elizabeth believes they are, or if they are impostors that need to be destroyed, as Saturnyne argues.\nAs soon as Elizabeth and Brian find themselves alone again, she tries to goad him to draw the sword and fight her. They are again interrupted by Saturnyne, who leads them to their quarters. Jamie is awoken from his sleep by the newCaptain Britain Corps, who sneak in to murder him. He quickly captures them, and killsJubes Lee, before the siblings flee. During the conflict, Brian inadvertently draws the Sword of Might and transforms into Captain Avalon, the sworn defender of his brother's kingdom. When Saturnyne attempts to take the Amulet of Right from Elizabeth to restore Brian to the role of Captain Britain, she destroys it, causing an enraged Saturnyne to imprison her and theCaptain Britain Corps, who she means to execute.\nElizabeth contacts the corps, who tell her there is no escaping their prison. Jamie contacts her and helps her escape, and she vows to return for the other captains. The two go to Saturnyne's bedchambers, where she is in the midst of seducing Brian. She reveals that the Amulet of Right is now meaningless, and she has the means of making him Captain Britain by herself. She reveals theStarlight Sword, another of the prophesized blades, and offers it to Brian. Brian plays along with her advances, and when his siblings enter the room, he gives Elizabeth the sword. Brian rejects Saturnyne and accepts his new role as Captain Avalon. He and Elizabeth travel to Krakoa to take up their positions as champions, wielding the Sword of Might and the Starlight Sword respectively.\nX OF SWORDS, PART 9"

Recalling his various regrets, Eddie notes that his greatest was not telling his sonDylan Brockthe truth about his parentage, or even that he loves him.\nAtRex Strickland's warehouse, Dylan anxiously waits for Eddie to return, attempting to baitthe Makerinto doing something other than putting a few finishing touches on the codex-extraction machine. Munching on some potato chips,Normie Osbornwonders what's wrong with the Maker before threatening to tell on Dylan when he swears. Removing his helmet, the Maker announces that his machine is finished - horrifying Dylan and Normie with the sight of his cranial augmentations. Putting his helmet back on, the Maker invites them to inspect the machine, which Dylan dubs theS.C.I.T.H.E.- the Maker disdainfully rejecting the name. When the Maker tells Normie to get in, Dylan snaps that Spider-Man and Venom told him not to touch Normie and to wait until they came back with Norman; the Maker retorting that for all Dylan knows Spider-Man and Venom are dead and Carnage is on his way right now to kill them all, remarking that he doesn't want the death of an innocent child on his conscience. As Dylan angrily refuses to let the Maker use Normie as a test subject, the mad scientist contorts his body to loom menacingly over him. Unintimidated, Dylan sneers that the Maker would have to explain to Spider-Man and Venom why he hurt the kids he was tasked with protecting, asking how he sees that conversation going. As the Maker grumbles that Dylan takes after his father, a proximity alarm goes off.\nAgony,Phage,Riot, andLasherrip through the wall of the warehouse; the Maker condescendingly disparaging them before activating the warehouse's new anti-symbiote defense system and telling it to kill them. As guns descend from the ceiling and open fire, the Maker tells Dylan and Normie to barricade themselves in the armory, Dylan showing Normie the arsenal of weapons inside. Lasher snares the Maker by the throat with a tendril, snarling that Carnage has tasked them with claiming Normie Osborn's codex and will kill them if they fail. As Lasher prepares to impale him with a bladed tendril, the Maker grabs a sonic gun and shoots the symbiote point-blank in the face. Freed from theLasher symbiote's control, Sadie dazedly wonders where she is and what happened to her family. Switching the rifle to live ammunition, the Maker remarks that while most people would view her young age as an impediment to taking her life, he couldn't care less. As he aims the gun point-blank at Sadie's head, Riot, Agony, and Phage grab him; Agony melting the gun with a jet of acid. As the Lasher symbiote reclaims Sadie, Riot tells Phage to get Normie.\nIn the armory, Dylan hefts a gun and tells Normie to stay out of sight. Normie asks if Dylan knows how to use the gun, Dylan replying that he doesn't before asking how hard it could be. Phage rips through the door and slices the gun in half, snarling that Dylan reeks of Venom. Stating that he'll kill Dylan for fun before claiming Normie's codex for Carnage, Phage manifests bladed arms and tendrils. Before he can attack, he is grabbed from behind and his neck snapped. Appearing out of invisibility,Sleeperintroduces itself to them and says they can trust it because they're family.\nABSOLUTE CARNAGE TIE-IN!\n• With CARNAGE on the loose, VENOM must protect his son Dylan — at all costs!"

Thor has misgivings, not just about the plan, but trusting Lorelei. As opposed to Loki, since he believes Loki is not the one who wronged him. He asks his brother why, if he disagrees with the All-Mother, he does not simply confront them. Loki, refusing to believe they have good intent, simply calls in the favor owed by saving Thor from the case of possession some weeks earlier.\nNow, and Thor notes he remembers the favor, and shall discuss it the next time he and Loki meet. With Heimdall suitably distracted, Loki and Lorelei use a Charm of Liquid Solids to enter the dungeons of Asgardia. As they make their way through them, Lorelei notes the total absence of any guards, which Loki puts down to the Room Full of Incredibly Deadly Traps, the second obstacle on their way in. As Loki notes, what makes the traps so incredibly deadly is that some of them aren't there at all. Fortunately, he has help with that; a cell-phone with magically boosted connection, and Verity Willis, who can see through the illusions for them.\nThat done, Loki and Lorelei reach the third obstacle, an impregnable gate, which neither of them can open. Fortunately, at that point, Sigurd the Ever-Glorious opens the door for them.\nEarlier than earlier, in the dumpster Loki and Sigurd wound up in during their fight, Loki begins randomly kicking the sides, while explaining his plan; Sigurd gets captured in order to act as Loki's inside man in Asgardia, with the illusion of Loki's defeat helped by a handy bottle of ketchup to fool any observers.\nBack in the present, Lorelei starts to point out Loki said they were breaking into the most secure prison in Asgardia. Loki tells her Sigurd's was thesecondmost secure. Exasperated, Lorelei leaves, and Sigurd goes with her, leaving Loki to his own devices. Peering through one door, all Loki can find is an odd map, with a large 'x' on the top. He concludes that the cell he's looking for has no door. At which point, he comes face to face with Loki. The Old Loki.\nLoki tries to claim he was suspicious, but Old Loki shoots this down, claiming he was just looking for a means to wash his hands of his past crimes. Angered, Loki stabs Old Loki with Gram.\nIt has no effect on Old Loki, who points out that it shows the truths one hides, and this Loki hides nothing. He's well-aware he's the villain, and he enjoys it. He then tells Loki he is responsible for Gram's creation. And that's he's not the old Loki.\nHe is Loki's future, what Loki will become. At this point the All-Mother arrive, and demand Old Loki tell them the truth. He explains that in the future, Asgard will be ruled justly by a King Thor, with Loki as the ever-recurring villain, something the older Loki actually finds agreeable, though he quickly dodges the question of what happens to Midgard in that future.\nLoki, meanwhile, asks Frigga how she can allow this future to happen, to allow Asgard to be re-chained by destiny. Frigga's response is simple; knowing that there will be security, peace without the threat of Ragnarok, a better future, is a miracle, regardless of what happens. Angered, Loki quits his service. As he departs, Old Loki announces that he will make sure the future Asgard will come into being, for he is its agent."

Revealing that the entire Britannia Project was a scheme to gain access to the stone, Darwin thanks Croc for his accidental assistance. Craig the Corgi spots Union Jack rising to his feet and glowing, and Jack pushes aside Croc who attempts to strike him from behind. Skreem shields Jack with a sonic barrier, throwing away her mask and declaring herself The Choir. As the stumbling Union Jack reaches Darwin, the ghost of Britannia explodes free of Jack’s chest and attacks Darwin, though she is caught easily and thrown to the ground. Darwin invites her to watch him destroy the British Isles, starting with blasting the roof off the Keep as he leaves. The weakened ghost of Britannia calls to the other heroes, explaining that she cannot do this alone and she needs their help. Croc’s team flee the Tower, while the cowering Selwyn James hides with a mace in a store-room and is discovered by Craig. At Tower Bridge, Darwin stops to proclaim the dawning of a new age, and realising he intends to reach Downing Street Union Jack commandeers a taxi. Aiming to distract Darwin and buy time for Union Jack, Snakes hurls Bulldog onto the bridge and the heroes mount an attack on Emperor. While Snakes rescues an endangered civilian the crowd rejects the heroes, and Darwin leaves, declaring they’re unfit to protect the people, as they are only “a bunch of freaks and monsters.”\nAs Darwin arrives at Downing Street so too does Union Jack, crashing the taxi into the superpowered villain. Darwin snaps Jack’s wrist and hurls him into the wall, explaining Joe is the weakest of all his team. As Darwin rings the doorbell of 10 Downing Street he is attacked by Croc’s gang and defeats Volcanna and Lady Shimmering Lights. Britannia rouses Union Jack, explaining that he has carried her spirit within his body, protecting and empowering him- he was never useless, or weak, and is the only one who can save them. Drawing back his broken arm and full of Britannia’s strength, Jack knocks Darwin unconscious. Doc Croc retrieves the stone from Darwin’s hand, only to have it stolen and swallowed by Craig—who is revealed not to be the real Craig, but Selwyn James, Sponge, using Shifter’s stolen transformative power. Sponge and The Choir turn on Doc Croc, and he is captured after a sonic blast.\nThree days later, Selwyn James visits Union Jack in hospital to update him. Doc Croc is locked up in Belmarsh, Steve Darwin’s technology company collapses and the ghost of Britannia takes her leave, to return in Britain’s darkest hour. The Britannia Project are not contactable, but have stuck together, which is no issue for Jack or James as James has been reshuffled to the department for Environment. The Empire stone has been left at 10 Downing street, fresh from Sponge’s doggy digestive system.\nTHE DRAMATIC FINALE!\n• Doc Croc has defeated Union Jack and the team!\n• But can this truly be the end of the line for our new heroes?"

After trading blows withCaptain GloryandSuper-Skrull, they are teleported away byMur-G'nntoWiccan's apartment.\nIn theAvengers Mansion,Tony Starkis working on aFantastic Four-inspired armor, still worryingMister Fantastic.

TheInvisible Woman,The Thingand theHulkaccompanyMantistoQuoiand theSwordsman's output inLake Victoria, and she attempts to convince her son to give up on his plan of genocide. The Hulk suddenly turns against her allies, revealing that she is actually a Cotati who had taken over the Hulk's body when theAvengerswere on theMoon. Meanwhile back at Wiccan's apartment, Billy uses magic to see the Hulkling that Carol saw, and determines that there is no way that person is the man he had married, revealing that he and Teddy had previously held a wedding.\nInside theAllianceflagship,Captain Marvelis reporting toSuper-Skrullthe difficultiesCaptain Americais experiencing to pull together the human forces. Super-Skrull sympathizes with her, mentioning how the Alliance's troops are not united due to the grudges of their empires. He also complains aboutTanalth the Pursuersequestering herself for a Kree ritual, and suggests waking upEmperor Hulkling. Carol disagrees, arguing they spent too much convincing him to rest and that they need him fresh due to theCotati's amassing of their troops inWakandato take theGreat Mound. Throughout this discussion, an inner monologue belonging to theBlack Pantherwonders whether his highest duty as a king is to his people or to the world, and asks himself what kind of sins he is willing to commit for them; posing the question of what makes a king. Hulkling steps into the scene accompanied byCaptain Gloryand states that he is ready to take over. He declares that he is ready to make the necessary sacrifices, and elaborates by ordering the deployment of thePyrein case it becomes necessary to activate it. Captain Marvel and theHuman Torchare surprised, and Carol orders herUniversal Weaponto make a full genetic scan of Hulkling and find out if he's been replaced with a shapeshifter. Glory objects to it, but Hulkling allows her to perform the scan, which identifies Hulkling as whom he's supposed to be, to Carol's shock. Hulkling malevolently asks Carol if that settles everything, but both her and the Human Torch take a stand, with Johnny flaming on. Still doubtful of Teddy's identity, Carol objects to the destruction of theEarth. Captain Glory punches her, arguing that if the Cotati take the world, they will have the power to murder a galaxy. Johnny reminds him that both theFantastic Fourand theAvengershave had experience against impossible odds. Super-Skrull holds Johnny from behind, absorbing his flame while reproaching that the Fantastic Four were nowhere whenGalactusconsumed the Skrull throneworld. Johnny warns Super-Skrull that despite the use of his powers to siphon his own, he will set ablaze again. Johnny falters, to which Kl'rt reveals he is using his hypnotism on him. He is interrupted when Captain Glory is lunged at him from behind by Carol. Hulkling ordersMur-G'nnto use her magic to teleport the two away, and she reluctantly concedes. Mur-G'nn informs Hulkling that was a spell she had prepared in case of evacuation. Captain Glory complains both that she didn't execute them and that she let Danvers get away with the Universal Weapon. Hulkling brushes that off, but ponders where did Mur-G'nn teleport them. Carol and Johnny materialize in the middle of an apartment, which Johnny notices is in New York. Carol recalls that magic responds to intent, and it's possible Mur-G'nn had doubts about Hulkling as well. The two are then approached byWiccan, revealing they are at his home, where he has briefly returned home between fighting the invasion. He asks if Teddy sent them, and Johnny decides to be blunt and tell Billy that his boyfriend wants to detonate the sun, and asks Wiccan for his phone.\nAt theAvengers Mountain,Mister Fantastichangs up after talking with Johnny, and tells him to stay with Carol. Reed approachesTony Starkapproaches him to tell him the news about the Alliance's use of the Pyre in case the Cotati are not stopped in Wakanda. They both theorize the Kree and the Skrull could still do it even if it's not necessary. When Tony notes that this emergency is another item for their to-do list, Reed brings attention to the fact that Tony is working on a suit, gesturing to an incomplete blue and white Iron Man-like armor with the Fantastic Four chest emblem. Reed questions if Tony should be spending his time on it. Tony asks Reed if he is serious, and rebukes him, pointing out that he sentThoron a quest because it is his process of solving problems, whereas building an armor is his own process since he thinks in suits. He walks away, asking Reed to let him think. In his inner monologue, T'Challa poses the question of what makes a leader. He reveals that Reed opened with his worries about Tony in a communication to inform him about the Pyre.\nIn Wakanda, T'Challa wields theStar-Swordto hold the line against and endless swarm of Cotati soldiers at the base of the Great Mound. He is fighting alongside theDora Milajeand theHatut Zeraze. T'Challa recalls telling Reed to work on his priorities. Continuing his narration, Black Panther explains that the Cotati managed to beach Wakanda's defenses through a mix of telepathic manipulation and brute force, and that his own troops are one step behind against the Cotati's ability to communicate at the speed of thought. T'Challa admits that he should be focused, but wonders what are his own priorities, reiterating the question of what makes a king. He contemplates the idea of ordering the entire Wakandan area to be irradiated to prevent further growth of anything in the soil. He admits that it's a seductive thought that would show his determination as a king, whereas the Cotati would only be inconvenienced and would seek another place of power elsewhere in the universe. T'Challa tells himself that victory will not come from hollow shows, and that a king's true priority is peace.\nInLake Victoria,Quoiexpresses his confusion that Wakanda still stands. As he observes the battle from an amber orb, theSwordsmanreminds him that T'Challa is a master strategist, and warns him about strategies they can't see. The Swordsman realizes there are combatants missing from the battle, including theInvisible Woman, prompting Quoi to wonder if they should expect an attack where they are.Mantistells him no as the Invisible Woman turns her visible from within an energy field, alongside theHulkandThe Thing. The Swordsman draws his sword, but Quoi agrees to her his mother out. Quoi recalls that his mother tried to communicate with him through a construct before, and tries to goad her, treating her as a hypocrite. Mantis admits that she might not always do what is best for Quoi, but tells him that her wrongs can't justify his. She warns him about the burden of committing genocide, but Quoi brushes it off since he believes he will bring days of peace, something he accuses animals of being incapable of. Mantis uses the Kree/Skrull alliance as an example of the contrary, and asks Quoi why must he hold on to his grudges. He sardonically supposes they united to bring apologies to the Cotati. He brings up the destruction of theKral System, and assumes they are ready to do the same again, using that to ask his mother if he isn't this world's savior. The Invisible Woman tells him that nobody has done anything and that there is still time to talk. The Hulk interjects, revealing that the Alliance has deployed the Pyre, and suggests Quoi to press his attack immediately. When The Thing expresses his confusion, the Hulk detonates a gamma blast in response, sending Mantis, Ben and Sue flying away. Mantis and Sue manage to survive with a force field. Ben lands away from them, and the Hulk jumps in front of him. She expels vines out of her mouth, and explains that when Cotati assimilate a human's dead body, they turn their skin green, so they took advantage that the Hulk already had a green skin to take her over when the Avengers were on theMoon. The vines form a face on top of the Hulk's head and begin to extend to the rest of her body. The Hulk Cotati emphasizes that she is wearing Jen's dead body like clothes and warns The Thing that she is going to send him to meet her, delivering a devastating blow to his face. Back in Lake Victoria, the Swordsman rejoices on the turn of events and the fact that their Hulk will kill the heroes. When Quoi points out that one of them is her mother, the Swordsman admits that he shares feelings for her due to his human template, but asks Quoi if they can join weakness like animals. Mantis reaches out to Quoi telepathically and begs him to stop, but he shuts her out and concurs with his father. The Swordsman walks into a portal gateway, telling Quoi that this location has served its purpose as a lure, and assuring him that when they meet Earth's heroes next it will be their moment of absolute triumph. In his inner monologue, Black Panther asks himself if he is a weak man, and asserts that it is impossible to win any fight by surrendering what you have fought for.\nBack at Wiccan's apartment, Billy uses magic to see the Hulkling that Carol saw, and assures her that it wasn't the real Hulkling. He brings attention to his facial expressions, saying that even when possessed or mind-controlled, he'd see something of Teddy. Johnny and Carol explain that they verified his identity at a genetic level, but Wiccan insists that the man up there isn't the man he married. A flashback shot shows Teddy and Wiccan kissing at the altar in a chapel accompanied by theYoung Avengers.\nTHE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER…\n• Tensions mount as the action heats up!\n• As the attack on Wakanda intensifies, the heroes find themselves under attack from their enemies — and their allies!\n• In a war where nobody can be fully trusted, betrayal cuts deep — as the alien invasion claims its first casualty!"

Inside, Loki and Verity Willis are talking, the god of mischief having gone to the effort of cooking for her. Verity decides to skip to the business, and asks Loki if he has an ulterior motive for inviting her around. Meanwhile, Sigurd sneaks inside the apartment, using an invisibility belt stolen from A.I.M.. Verity tries to tell Loki she won't help him break into somewhere, only to stop on noticing the invisible Sigurd, carrying Loki's sword.\nSigurd's attempts to flirt with Verity quickly fail, at which point he informs Loki of his intent to borrow his sword for a while, and that there's no need for them to fight. Loki flashes back to some time earlier, to another inconvenient summons from the All-Mother, who are still incensed about his previous failure to retrieve Lorelei, and express hope he's better at finding Sigurd. Loki questions why he needs to bring Sigurd in, when the Dirsir are supposed to be tracking him, only to be implicitly threatened with his own freedom being revoked. Therefore, it's down to Sigurd's freedom, or Loki's. Loki draws his backup sword, Laevateinn, which Sigurd mocks. The two fight, resulting in Loki being kicked out of the window. Fortunately, he's saved by the local washing line, and his seven-league boots. He provokes Sigurd into attacking him again. The two parry, until Sigurd cuts the line, sending both gods plummeting into a dumpster. Violence quickly follows, ending with Gram stabbing through the dumpster, and Sigurd slinking off into the night.\nIn the here and now, Kaluu asks what exactly Sigurd wants. Conversation turns to the wheel of reincarnation. Since Sigurd, like all Asgardians, is destined to end up in Valhalla, he's concerned about any potential injuries the Valkyrie waiting for him will inflict. In essence, he wants to avoid going there at all, to reincarnate into someone else. Kaluu agrees to help. Using the sword's truth-bearing properties, the two sign an agreement in blood, at which point Kaluu turns out to be Mephisto, who is overjoyed to have tricked a god. The promised \"wheel of reincarnation\" turns out to be a torture device called \"the wheel of rein-incarnation\". As Sigurd tries to attack Mephisto, he is restrained, and the carpet Mephisto was sitting on turns out to be the contract. Mephisto goes to examine it.\nOnly he discovers it's not his contract, it's Loki's. He switched the prayer mats while Sigurd was explaining things, using his vanishing coat, Lorelei's amulet of invisibility, and the invisibility belt to disguise himself. Mephisto is outraged, on account of Loki using cheap misdirection to fool him, something \"the young punk\" would do. Whispering, Mephisto reveals that he knows what's happened to the younger Loki, and offers his commendations.\nAngered, Loki tells him to leave, and Mephisto merrily does. Sigurd, meanwhile, is teleported right into the All-Mother's throne room, still in chains. Gaea and Igunn both express reservations about imprisoning Sigurd, though Freyja states it is necessary."

He quickly flatters the young prince, and the two walk along. Eventually, they met a river, when an otter greets them. Loki instantly kills the otter, skins it, and cooks it. Later, the two reach an inn, and are greatly warmly by its owner, Hriedmar of the Vanir. As they drink, he mentions his third son Otr, a shape-changer, went to get food and had not returned. As Odin realizes what has happened, and tries to leave, Otr's brothers arrive. Loki informs the men who Odin is, causing one brother, named Fafnir, to consider holding him to ransom. His father refuses to barter someone's life for gold. Instead, he commands Loki to fetch enough gold to cover Otrs' skin by dawn, or Odin will be killed.\nAgreeing, Loki goes to fetch some gold, from Andvari the Dwarf, who constantly guards his horde in the shape of a giant pike, one that cannot be caught by hook or net or spell. So Loki just kills him with a bazooka. In his death throes, Andvari curses the horde to force anyone around it to tell the truth. Loki avoids this side-step by not lying about where and how he got it, and by not keeping the horde. This done, Loki and Odin leave, and as they do, Loki asks Odin to build a box to be locked with five keys, imbued with what power he can find, with a promise that he will return to tell him what to put in the box later.\nMeanwhile, the gold's curse brings out the true natures of Otr's family, and Fafnir the greedy kills his father and flees with the horde. However, his brother Regin the Vengeful survives, swearing vengeance on his brother and Asgard. To this end he forges a mighty sword, named Gram, while Fafin is consumed by greed, and turned into a dragon.\nThen, Sigurd the Ever-Glorious enters the story, one day stopping at Regin's inn. Regin, recognizing the hero on sight, talks him around to going after Fafnir, giving him Gram to do the deed. The next day, Sigurd does exactly that. When he returns to the inn with the dragon's heart, a magpie warns him of the curse, as Regin prepares to murder him. Sigurd strikes the man with the sword, and Gram, just as cursed as the gold, reveals a truth to him; that he was a simple killer, and he dies then and there from shock. The magpie counsels Sigurd to eat the dragon's heart, and become a legend, before taking off into the night.\nYears later, when King Bor of Asgard dies, the magpie, which is in fact Loki, returns and tells Odin to place the sword, left behind by Sigurd when he fled Asgard, into the box, and allow the story of it to grow. And with that, the old Loki returns to his own time."

With careful analysis, Loki determines that Lorelei has been committing crimes on an annual basis, and had chosen a casino in Monte Carlo for the purpose. Unable to catch her before or after, Loki determined he would have to catch her in the act. However, since he could not use magic, for fear of detection, he had to be himself.\nDuring the heist, Lorelei sends one of her hired thieves to fetch the car, only for the accomplice to be caught by the police, the invisibility charm she had been given having been stolen by Loki. This leaves Lorelei alone with her other accomplice, who turns out to be a shapeshifted Loki, who justifies this by saying he is \"always himself.\"\nBefore Loki could talk to Lorelei, she disappeared, leaving Loki alone in a vault with a large amount of cash, which he decided to make off with. This brings Loki to the present, where Lorelei is desperate to acquire new funds, the old fashioned way - mugging speed daters. And this time Loki is in disguise, except to the woman opposite him, which has Loki intrigued. The woman, one Verity Willis, explains that she can see through lies, every lie, and has done since she was a child, meaning she cannot even watch a film or read a book, and she is incredibly lonely because of it. Loki reassures her, before heading off to attend to Lorelei."

Inside, Thor is in an uncharacteristically aggressive mood, demanding mead from Jarvis. He notices Loki peering in through the window, and attacks. Loki's fall catches the attention of Hawkeye and Black Widow, and he is saved from plummeting to his death by a grappling arrow. This does however leave Loki surrounded by the Avengers. On questioning from Thor, Loki openly tells the truth: that he is working on behalf of the All-Mother, before distracting Thor by reminding him about the time Tony Stark cloned him. This enrages Thor, allowing Loki to slip past. Hawkeye's attempts to stop him fail, due to some magical misdirection from Loki causing the archer's arrow to wind up in Bruce Banner.\nUsing the distraction, Loki makes his way to the Avengers Database, and uses it to find all the information the Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D., and anyone else, may have on him, before promptly deleting it all, since those stories contained a metaphysical weight that would pull Loki back towards villainy, something Loki wishes to avoid.\nHowever, in the time it takes to do this, the Avengers catch up to him. Thor advocates killing Loki, and tries to do that. In that instant, Mjolnir becomes impossible for him to carry, allowing Loki to slip around Thor, and stab him, causing strange energies to pour out of Thor's body.\nIn a flashback, it is revealed why Loki has stabbed Thor; after his most recent encounter with Malekith the Accursed, some manner of corruption has entered him, causing Thor to become increasingly violent, arrogant and belligerent. This is why Loki retrieved Gram, the sword of Sigurd, which forces those it injures to suffer the truth. It works, freeing Thor from the contamination, which is promptly sealed in a special jar Loki had brought along, though his celebration is cut short when the Hulk knocks him out.\nA short time later, in a cell, Thor and Loki talk. The thunder god ruminates of his former history of arrogance, and whether he has in fact changed since those days. Loki reassures him, and the two brothers share a drink before Loki's inevitable escape."

He quickly flatters the young prince, and the two walk along. Eventually, they met a river, when an otter greets them. Loki instantly kills the otter, skins it, and cooks it. Later, the two reach an inn, and are greatly warmly by its owner, Hriedmar of the Vanir. As they drink, he mentions his third son Otr, a shape-changer, went to get food and had not returned. As Odin realizes what has happened, and tries to leave, Otr's brothers arrive. Loki informs the men who Odin is, causing one brother, named Fafnir, to consider holding him to ransom. His father refuses to barter someone's life for gold. Instead, he commands Loki to fetch enough gold to cover Otrs' skin by dawn, or Odin will be killed.\nAgreeing, Loki goes to fetch some gold, from Andvari the Dwarf, who constantly guards his horde in the shape of a giant pike, one that cannot be caught by hook or net or spell. So Loki just kills him with a bazooka. In his death throes, Andvari curses the horde to force anyone around it to tell the truth. Loki avoids this side-step by not lying about where and how he got it, and by not keeping the horde. This done, Loki and Odin leave, and as they do, Loki asks Odin to build a box to be locked with five keys, imbued with what power he can find, with a promise that he will return to tell him what to put in the box later.\nMeanwhile, the gold's curse brings out the true natures of Otr's family, and Fafnir the greedy kills his father and flees with the horde. However, his brother Regin the Vengeful survives, swearing vengeance on his brother and Asgard. To this end he forges a mighty sword, named Gram, while Fafin is consumed by greed, and turned into a dragon.\nThen, Sigurd the Ever-Glorious enters the story, one day stopping at Regin's inn. Regin, recognizing the hero on sight, talks him around to going after Fafnir, giving him Gram to do the deed. The next day, Sigurd does exactly that. When he returns to the inn with the dragon's heart, a magpie warns him of the curse, as Regin prepares to murder him. Sigurd strikes the man with the sword, and Gram, just as cursed as the gold, reveals a truth to him; that he was a simple killer, and he dies then and there from shock. The magpie counsels Sigurd to eat the dragon's heart, and become a legend, before taking off into the night.\nYears later, when King Bor of Asgard dies, the magpie, which is in fact Loki, returns and tells Odin to place the sword, left behind by Sigurd when he fled Asgard, into the box, and allow the story of it to grow. And with that, the old Loki returns to his own time."

After a moment's though, Thor declares that he will trust Loki, and hands over the last key, as the two brothers have their first shared drink in centuries.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nSome hours before, in an apartment, Loki's attempt at showering is interrupted by the appearance of the All-Mother, who have an assignment for him.\nThis leads to Loki running up the side of Avengers Tower, via some Seven-League Boots, and using a vanishing cloak to make himself invisible to the Avengers. Inside, Thor is in an uncharacteristically aggressive mood, demanding mead from Jarvis. He notices Loki peering in through the window, and attacks. Loki's fall catches the attention of Hawkeye and Black Widow, and he is saved from plummeting to his death by a grappling arrow. This does however leave Loki surrounded by the Avengers. On questioning from Thor, Loki openly tells the truth: that he is working on behalf of the All-Mother, before distracting Thor by reminding him about the time Tony Stark cloned him. This enrages Thor, allowing Loki to slip past. Hawkeye's attempts to stop him fail, due to some magical misdirection from Loki causing the archer's arrow to wind up in Bruce Banner.\nUsing the distraction, Loki makes his way to the Avengers Database, and uses it to find all the information the Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D., and anyone else, may have on him, before promptly deleting it all, since those stories contained a metaphysical weight that would pull Loki back towards villainy, something Loki wishes to avoid.\nHowever, in the time it takes to do this, the Avengers catch up to him. Thor advocates killing Loki, and tries to do that. In that instant, Mjolnir becomes impossible for him to carry, allowing Loki to slip around Thor, and stab him, causing strange energies to pour out of Thor's body.\nIn a flashback, it is revealed why Loki has stabbed Thor; after his most recent encounter with Malekith the Accursed, some manner of corruption has entered him, causing Thor to become increasingly violent, arrogant and belligerent. This is why Loki retrieved Gram, the sword of Sigurd, which forces those it injures to suffer the truth. It works, freeing Thor from the contamination, which is promptly sealed in a special jar Loki had brought along, though his celebration is cut short when the Hulk knocks him out.\nA short time later, in a cell, Thor and Loki talk. The thunder god ruminates of his former history of arrogance, and whether he has in fact changed since those days. Loki reassures him, and the two brothers share a drink before Loki's inevitable escape."

Thor has misgivings, not just about the plan, but trusting Lorelei. As opposed to Loki, since he believes Loki is not the one who wronged him. He asks his brother why, if he disagrees with the All-Mother, he does not simply confront them. Loki, refusing to believe they have good intent, simply calls in the favor owed by saving Thor from the case of possession some weeks earlier.\nNow, and Thor notes he remembers the favor, and shall discuss it the next time he and Loki meet. With Heimdall suitably distracted, Loki and Lorelei use a Charm of Liquid Solids to enter the dungeons of Asgardia. As they make their way through them, Lorelei notes the total absence of any guards, which Loki puts down to the Room Full of Incredibly Deadly Traps, the second obstacle on their way in. As Loki notes, what makes the traps so incredibly deadly is that some of them aren't there at all. Fortunately, he has help with that; a cell-phone with magically boosted connection, and Verity Willis, who can see through the illusions for them.\nThat done, Loki and Lorelei reach the third obstacle, an impregnable gate, which neither of them can open. Fortunately, at that point, Sigurd the Ever-Glorious opens the door for them.\nEarlier than earlier, in the dumpster Loki and Sigurd wound up in during their fight, Loki begins randomly kicking the sides, while explaining his plan; Sigurd gets captured in order to act as Loki's inside man in Asgardia, with the illusion of Loki's defeat helped by a handy bottle of ketchup to fool any observers.\nBack in the present, Lorelei starts to point out Loki said they were breaking into the most secure prison in Asgardia. Loki tells her Sigurd's was thesecondmost secure. Exasperated, Lorelei leaves, and Sigurd goes with her, leaving Loki to his own devices. Peering through one door, all Loki can find is an odd map, with a large 'x' on the top. He concludes that the cell he's looking for has no door. At which point, he comes face to face with Loki. The Old Loki.\nLoki tries to claim he was suspicious, but Old Loki shoots this down, claiming he was just looking for a means to wash his hands of his past crimes. Angered, Loki stabs Old Loki with Gram.\nIt has no effect on Old Loki, who points out that it shows the truths one hides, and this Loki hides nothing. He's well-aware he's the villain, and he enjoys it. He then tells Loki he is responsible for Gram's creation. And that's he's not the old Loki.\nHe is Loki's future, what Loki will become. At this point the All-Mother arrive, and demand Old Loki tell them the truth. He explains that in the future, Asgard will be ruled justly by a King Thor, with Loki as the ever-recurring villain, something the older Loki actually finds agreeable, though he quickly dodges the question of what happens to Midgard in that future.\nLoki, meanwhile, asks Frigga how she can allow this future to happen, to allow Asgard to be re-chained by destiny. Frigga's response is simple; knowing that there will be security, peace without the threat of Ragnarok, a better future, is a miracle, regardless of what happens. Angered, Loki quits his service. As he departs, Old Loki announces that he will make sure the future Asgard will come into being, for he is its agent."

When Brice smugly rejects Rogers' demand to play another round, Rogers boasts that the Kingpin owes him a debt - a boast that gets him kicked out. Indicating his neck brace, Montana warns Rogers not to talk too loudly about what the Kingpin owes him lest he wind up in the obituaries. Stalking Rogers from the shadows using a swarm of spiders manifested from the symbiote, Gwen Stacy notes that even before he sold his soul he'd never been much of a cop, having only hung on because the other officers found him funny and having been reprimanded sixteen times over four years. Watching Rogers mug some street gamblers, she notes that instead of firing him he'd been assigned to desk duty, making him think he could get away with anything. Gwen notes she's been following him for days looking for even the slightest redemptive qualities, the Venom symbiote influencing her into deciding to kill him.\nVenom infiltrates Rogers apartment while he's sleeping and terrifies him, mocking him with her ability to sense his self-loathing over what he did to Captain Stacy. Rogers protests he was cleared of all charges, but Venom looms over him and states that despite the thrill of being useful for once in his life he'll never matter again. Venom dangles Rogers off the roof of his apartment and launches into a monologue about how she once thought what she did mattered, but now despite being stronger than ever she feels weak. Venom is interrupted by Frank Castle, who mocks her angst, and immediately attacks him for stealing her revenge against the Rhino, intermittently flashing back to Cindy Moon's advice as they clash.\nCastle repels Venom with his War Machine gauntlet and mocks her desire for revenge against the Kingpin's pawns, asking if she'll go after the Bodega Bandit next. Stating that Gwen is finally free with nothing else to lose and nothing to hold her back, Castle proposes they work together to take down the Kingpin, Matt Murdock. Venom incredulously asks if he's drunk, accusing him of being the one who ruined her home life by targeting her and her father. Flying into a rage, she tears the apartment's rooftop apart, and when she's calmed down Castle notes that he can see she needs time to mull over his offer. Venom sullenly retorts that she'll never be like him, but Castle only chuckles and throws her a burner phone, saying he'll be in touch. Venom offers Rogers a final chance to do the right thing and turn himself in for his role in Captain Stacy's beating, warning him that if he runs she'll hunt him down and exact her revenge.\nAfter Venom's webbing dissolves, Rogers calls DA Nelson from a payphone, terrified out of his mind, and asks for him to contact Matt Murdock - who is sitting across from Foggy in his office. As Foggy assures Rogers that he'll send someone over, a group of Hand ninja materialize out of the shadows and impale the phone booth with their katanas.\nOutside a theatre where the Mary Janes' gig was supposed to be held, Ben Parker tries to hand out missing persons of Gwen fliers to an apathetic crowd. He gets a text message from Mary Jane asking if he can go to Williamsburg and relieve Betty, but as he struggles with the phone's autocorrect a man carelessly bumps into him and knocks the fliers and phone from his grasp. Ben angrily grabs the man and slams him into the theatre wall, yelling at him for being careless and punching it. The man calls him crazy and runs off, leaving Ben to massage his bruised knuckles. Venom emerges from the shadows overhead, stating she knows exactly how he feels and that maybe they can work together to figure out where to put their anger and pain at the injustice of the world as she retracts the symbiote from her face, revealing herself as Gwen Stacy.\nGWENOM Part 3\n• With pressure mounting on all sides, the police force ratchets up their manhunt for the dangerous fugitive called Spider-Woman!"

Grousing that she doesn't like coincidences, she arrives inWashington Square Park, whereReed Richardsis playing chess. Reed greets her as \"Spider-Woman\" and notes that it's been a while since they last met, his opponent - an older man - protesting that they're not doing anything illegal.\nReassuring the man that she's not there to police them, Ghost-Spider informs Reed that she's changed her codename, and he scolds her for not keeping in touch. Reed's opponent concedes the game and leaves, Reed noting that he was three or four moves away from victory anyway. As Ghost-Spider takes the vacated chair, Reed asks her how she found him. Gwen replies that he hasn't exactly been hiding and she's noticed him in the background of social media posts. Reed remarks that if hehadbeen trying to hide Gwen would never have found him, Ghost-Spider noting she never wants to meet an evil incarnation of him. Reed agrees and asks Ghost-Spider what she wants, and she replies that he is aware of the existence of theMultiverseand wants to know if he's ever met another incarnation of himself. Resetting the board, Reed replies that he has and notes that not all of them are agreeable. Gwen asks if he knows about Johnny and Susan Storm; Reed noting that in most realities they're his age and close allies, and he's not sure why that's not the case in Earth-65.\nAs Reed remarks that it's her move, Ghost-Spider grouses that she doesn't like him being unsure and protests that she's not playing. Reed replies that she will if she wants to chat with him, Ghost-Spider acquiescing and telling Reed what's been going on with the Storm twins. Reed asks why she'd think he cares, Ghost-Spider stating it's because in most universes they're a family. As Reed reminds her that's not the case with Earth-65, Ghost-Spider asks if there's any universes where they have powers and he doesn't; Reed asking her what's going on. Ghost-Spider admits all she has is a hunch, but that it's making her uncomfortable, Reed promising to keep his eyes open and remarking that it was nice to see her again - joking that he was beginning to worry she'd forgotten about him.\nWatching their conversation from his lair,the Maker- an evil incarnation of Reed Richards - angrily reprimands Gwen for getting his Earth-65 counterpart involved, and that she only has herself to blame for what's about to happen and needs to learn to leave well-enough alone.\nRealizing that the conversation with Reed didn't help as much as she'd hoped, Gwen notes that so far as she knows Johnny and Sue are always good guys. Deciding to take her mind off superheroing with schoolwork, Gwen activates theTicket to the Multiverseand warps to theEarth-616. Transforming hersymbioteinto civilian clothes, Gwen notes that the Storms can wait for now, and that if she gives them enough web, they're bound to end up tangling themselves. Smirking as she notes she's been thinking in spider metaphors, Gwen doesn't notice a poster forC.R.A.D.L.E..\nAs Gwen takes a seat in theESUlecture hall, she notes that she doesn't understand why people find material on superhero ethics to be hard. Informing the class thatDr. Connorsis unavailable,Peter Parkerstates that they will be reviewing the previously-covered material -- Gwen lamenting having missed those classes. Spotting her, Peter asks that she stay after class. When the class ends, Gwen walks to the front and notes that at least she's not Public Enemy Number One in Earth-616. As Gwen asks what he wants, Peter tells her to wait until all the students have left, Gwen complaining that everyone will think they're in a relationship. Agreeing on how disturbing the rumor is, Peter ignores Gwen teasing him about his age and says that he needs to have a serious talk with her.\nGwen tells him that theJackalfrom Earth-616 followed her to Earth-65 and attempted to kidnap her. Horrified, Peter asks if she's alright and Gwen remarks that she got away, but is confused as to why he was so obsessed with her, telling Peter that the Jackal had murderedhis Earth-65 counterpart. Peter tells Gwen that the Jackal had been obsessed withher Earth-616 counterpartand laments having not thought to warn her about him. Gwen grouses that he's her problem now, telling Peter not to blame himself for the situation. Peter warns her that the Jackal won't stop coming after her, and Gwen replies that he'll suffer for thinking she's like the Earth-616 Gwen.\nAs Gwen smugly states she'll be fine since she's a superhero, Peter tells her that's what he wanted to talk to her about. Confused, Gwen asks him what's going on, and Peter informs her that there was an incident with theChampionsand thatMs. Marvelwas hospitalized with serious injuries. As Gwen asks if Kamala is alright, Peter notes that he's not involved enough to know, but that lobbyists petitioned the government to pass theUnderage Superhuman Welfare Act- a bill outlawing superheroes younger than 21. Shocked and disgusted, Gwen protests that Peter was just 15 when he got his powers. Peter attempts to calm her by saying that underaged heroes can be sponsored by an adult hero, but Gwen is only offended by his offer to chaperone her.\nGwen angrily demands to know if people aren't considered adults until they turn 21 in Earth-616, her symbiote sprouting shoulder spikes and writhing tendrils. Peter tells her that people are considered adults at 18, asking if that's not the case in Earth-65 as well. Gwen states that it is, and that 18-year-olds are able to pay taxes, own property, and get married, but that for some reason in Earth-616 they're not allowed to fight for what's right.\nPeter indignantly tells Gwen he's just trying to warn her to be careful, but she fires back asking why no-one has been protesting it. Peter tells her that the law was just passed and that the superhero community is still reeling from the incident, and Gwen asks how her ex-boyfriend,Miles Morales, is holding up - noting that she knows he and Kamala are close. Peter states that he knows Miles is upset over it, but that his former protégé has been avoiding him, Gwen sniping that that's understandable and that all C.R.A.D.L.E. and the Underage Superhuman Welfare Act are going to do is getmorepeople hurt; bitterly adding that such a law wouldn't have savedher Peterand might have gottenher fatherkilled.\nPeter lamentingly states that he's not saying the Underage Superhuman Welfare Act is right, just that it exists. Gwen asks if the adult superheroes support the law, Peter stating that some of them do. Gwen snaps that Peter had better not one of them, stating that him doing so would destroy her trust in others and belief that good people exist in the Multiverse. Peter avoids answering by stating that thus far she's mostly avoided hero activities in Earth-616 and that he needs her to keep doing so; adding that at least in her home universe she's not breaking the law by doing so.\nAs Gwen - who had been imprisoned in Earth-65 for her vigilantism - bitterly protests how unfair that is and that her father begrudgingly approves of her being Ghost-Spider, Peter tells her that's not how the law works. Her symbiote manifesting a jagged hood, Gwen furiously asks Peter when superheroes have ever been concerned about the upholding the law over matters of right and wrong.\nPeter suggests Gwen stay in Earth-65 for the time being and that he could excuse her absence by saying she has the flu, noting that the Stark visa also has allowances for events like alien invasions or dimensional rifts. Enraged, Gwen shouts that she's not skipping school because Peter's dimension decided to be stupid. Peter attempts to calm her by saying it's understandable that parents would be worried about their kids being in danger, but Gwen retorts that doesn't excuse passing a law that says legal adults can't fight their own battles. Storming off, Gwen snaps that she won't go looking for trouble in Earth-616, but that danger has never cared about how old she was. As she mockingly asks if he's happy now, Peter despondently watches her leave.\nBack in Earth-65, Ghost-Spider - her hood jagged as her symbiote resonates with her anger - furiously asks herself what Peter knows about being told he can't be a hero, sneering that while he may have been young once he's now old and out-of-touch with the world. Realizing that she can't talk to her father about it since he would wholeheartedly approve of the Underage Superhuman Welfare Act, Ghost-Spider spots a burning apartment complex and asks a nearby firefighter how bad it is. The firefighter tells her a lot of people are trapped inside, and Ghost-Spider rushes into the burning building.\nTransforming intoher Venom form, Ghost-Spider notes her symbiote lets her breathe through the smoke and tries to send its constituent spiders to find the trapped people, though they are incinerated. Coming across a firefighter carrying an unconscious person, Ghost-Spider begins searching the rooms - discovering a pair of children and leaping through the apartment's window to return them to their parents. Rushing back in, Ghost-Spider thinks to herself that she doesn't enjoy being a hero, but that someone has to do something, and that people need to own what they build and that she's trying to build something good. Rescuing several elderly people and a cat, Ghost-Spider is thanked by the firefighters - who say there's no way they could have saved everyone without her help - and remarks to herself that superheroes are good for something after all. Telling the firefighters to stay safe and that she needs some sleep, Ghost-Spider web-swings away.\nAcross the city, Sue Storm sits in a plush chair and asks Johnny if he's ready. Johnny asks if she's sure this is a good idea, but Sue brushes off his protests by saying it's a whole new world and that they're the ones who'll rule it. Activating her smartphone's video camera, Sue addresses her social media followers, Johnny joining her in the livestream. Sue tells her followers that now that they're back they're never leaving again, Johnny chiming in that things are different now. Adding that things are fantastic, Sue says that the least they can do is invite Ghost-Spider to join them for a superhero team-up as Johnny's hand bursts into flames.\n• Rock and roll dreams come true! It’s all eyes on THE MARY\nJANES as Gwen takes the band on a rip-roaring multiversal concert tour!"

Exasperated, Gwen asks her father why he can't just be proud of her; George protesting that while he's always proud of her he doesn't like that she's always risking her life. Gwen replies that the Storms had her back, though she's uneasy about not knowing what happened during the five years they went missing. George assures her that the Storms likely have a good reason for not telling anyone what happened - citing her keeping her own identity a secret - and that in the event they don't she'll figure it out; Gwen stating that she hopes he's right.\nFive years prior, Susan and Johnny Storm wander through the streets ofLatveriawith Johnny's friend Trevor. As Johnny remarks on how creepy the medieval-style village is, Sue tells him to stop griping. Johnny, sure that he and his older sister are an unshakable team and that she will look out for him, follows her intoCastle Doom.Doctor Doom, the armored dictator of Latveria, greets them and kneels before Sue, who introduces herself and her brother. To Johnny's shock and horror, Sue dismisses Trevor as worthless surplus and Doctor Doom kills him. Susan puts herself and Johnny through a grueling training regimen to hone their physical abilities to their prime; flirting with Doctor Doom while her brother uneasily watches from the sidelines. Fulfilling Susan's ruthless ambitions, Doom imbues the twins with superhuman powers; Susan and Johnny brutally sparring with each other to master them. Susan continues to seduce Doctor Doom while slowly usurping authority from him; and once she decides that she and her brother no longer have anything left to learn from Doom she murders him. As Johnny immolates Doom's corpse, Susan dons the tyrant's armor and usurps his identity to become the ruler of Latveria.\nIn the present day, Gwen returns to her bedroom lamenting that her father doesn't really understand what being a superhero is like. Noting that she needs to rest and gorge herself to heal her suit, Gwen decides to let Sue and Johnny handle superheroing while she recovers. Her phone buzzes, and she picks it up dreading an angry rant fromMJberating her for missing band practice again. Gwen is surprised to see an urgent message from the Storms saying they need to talk immediately, and confused as to how they got her number. Getting a vaguely threatening follow-up message specifying to meet at Times Square, Gwen sets out - inwardly panicking that something bad must be happening. Upon arriving, she's both relieved and even more confused to see the Storms leisurely waiting for her, asking if everything is alright.\nAs Johnny expresses amazement at Ghost-Spider saying she can out-speed trains, Sue tells him to focus. Ghost-Spider again asks if everything is okay, Sue dropping her friendly demeanor and replying that for them it is but for her it isn't. As Ghost-Spider reacts in shocked outrage, Sue demands that she leave New York immediately, declaring that the city belongs to her and her brother. As Johnny watches uneasily, Ghost-Spider angrily refuses to go anywhere, her hood becoming jagged and spikes jutting from her shoulders. Ghost-Spider tells Sue and Johnny that she's willing to put this incident behind her if they back down and leave immediately. Encasing Ghost-Spider's head in a bubble, Susan coldly retorts that she promised Johnny she'd give Gwen a chance to comply instead of killing her outright, but that since Gwen refused they're doing things her way; declaring her intent to kill George Stacy as well. As Ghost-Spider tries to pull the bubble off her head, Sue coldly states that she and her brother not only have more followers and a better reputation but are more skilled, adding that no-one will ever find Gwen's body. As Johnny protests that Sue promised she wouldn't kill Gwen, Sue retorts that she said she'dtrynot to but that things are so much simpler if Gwen just vanishes. As Johnny acquiesces, Gwen's symbiote forms bladed tendrils and lashes out at Sue, the bubble vanishing as she recoils in alarm. As Ghost-Spider catches her breath, the symbiote's tendrils coil around Sue and constrict her, threatening to impale her. Flaming on, Johnny burns the tendrils away with a blast of fire and then notes that Gwen is nowhere to be seen, assuming he burnt her to ashes. Retorting that if there's no body she's not dead, Sue checks under the billboard to find Ghost-Spider hiding.\nSue encases Ghost-Spider's head again, but the symbiote fills Gwen's lungs and begins breathing for her. To Sue's surprise, Ghost-Spider attempts to kick through her energy barrier, knocking her back. Johnny angrily attempts to immolate Gwen for attacking his sister; Ghost-Spider's symbiote resonating with her anger at the Storms turning on her and further transforming intoits Venomized form. Snapping that she's only defending herself, Ghost-Spider realizes she can't just web Johnny up and then comes up with a plan to put him out of commission; dodging his flame blasts as he says that New York isn't big enough for three superheroes, accidentally blasting Sue while distracted. As Ghost-Spider attempts to web-yank the Storms into each other, Sue encases her in a bubble and mockingly asks if Gwen really thought she could beat them. Ghost-Spider angrily demands to know why the Storms are attacking her when they were allies, Sue sneering that they used Gwen to establish themselves as heroes in the eyes of the public and intended to replace her all along. Johnny tells his sister to stop the villainous monologuing and just get killing Ghost-Spider over with, Sue reprimanding him to let her handle things. Johnny protests that they returned to New York to be superheroes and that they're already off to a bad start, Sue begrudgingly agreeing before saying that if Gwen refuses again they're doing things her way.\nIgnoring Gwen asking if she gets a say, Sue says she has a proposal. Fully transforming into her Venom form, Ghost-Spider listens incredulously as Sue states that New York doesn't have the social media infrastructure to sustain three superheroes, and that since Gwen already has a criminal record it will be all-too-easy for the beloved Storms to turn public opinion against her. Again threatening Gwen's father, Susan pulls out a doctored video framing Ghost-Spider as an accomplice of Man-Wolf. As Ghost-Spider protests that she'd never say or do the things in the video, Sue coldly retorts that it's Gwen's word against the Storms', asking Gwen who she thinks the public will believe when people still think Ghost-Spider is a supervillain. Sue issues the ultimatum to leave New York forever or be branded a villain and returned to prison, Johnny begging Gwen not to make this harder than it has to be. Releasing Ghost-Spider, Sue threatens to kill everyone she loves if Gwen doesn't turn over the city to her and her brother.\nReturning home, Gwen despairingly tells her father about the Storms and that she's going into exile in thePrime Marvel Universefor the time being. Sending messages out to theMary JanesandReed Richardstelling them that she's going away on interdimensional business and to be careful, Ghost-Spider uses theTicket to the Multiverseto travel to the Prime Marvel Universe.\nGwen Stacy has served hard time in prison on Earth-65 for her dalliances as the super hero known as GHOST-SPIDER… Will EARTH-616 be next?!"

Stating that she believes Gwen is still out there, Captain America says they just need to believe that she'll find her way home. Later, Captain America furiously confrontsMatthew Murdock, who is moving out of his penthouse suite. Murdock sarcastically remarks that moving seems perfectly reasonable now that Spider-Woman has becomea monsterand is out to get him, and that he was attacked in his own home bya dangerous vigilante. He mocks her for being knocked out and asks if she knows what happened to Spider-Woman; but Captain America turns the tables on him and states that that it must gall him that all the effort he put into trying to corrupt Spider-Woman was wasted, revealing that S.H.I.E.L.D. now has evidence of his membership with theHand. Murdock calls her bluff, remarking that she suspects he has a way of bringing Spider-Woman back from wherever she disappeared to; and adds that for once he's just as lost as anyone as to what happened to his nemesis.\nOnEarth-8,Utaureads off a list of ingredients from a box of cereal as he,Utaa, andSpider-Boysit at theAmazing Eight's kitchen table. As Utau remarks that the cereal is essentially tree bark, an exasperated Utaa asks how he can betray him when the fate of the Multiverse hangs in the balance. Utau retorts that he never liked Utaa's plan to begin with, and as Watchers their duty is to only observe and never interfere. Agast, Utaa demands to know how he can say that. Themiddle-aged Venomized Gweninterrupts as she andCharlotte Morales-Stacyenter, chiding Utaa for whisper-yelling. Gwen states that she's not holding the Watchers prisoner, saying she only took their interdimensional travel devices to prevent the Watchers from hurting the kids. Utaa asks why Spider-Boy calls Gwen \"Mom\" with an odd inflection, and Max mockingly retorts that it's obvious that the Gwen in front of them isn'ttheir mother; Charlotte adding that she's an alternate universe counterpart, and they show up all the time. Utaa incredulously states that's impossible as all incarnations of Gwen Stacy in the multiverse have been documented, adding that this Gwen is also an incarnation ofVenom; to the derision of Maximilian and Charlotte.\nOnEarth-617,Tony Starkwryly asksGwen-617andGwen-65if they're clones or evil robots, adding that he's almost as smart as he is handsome and rich, and that twin college co-eds don't show up onanyone'sdoorstep without it being a trap. Disgusted by his self-absorbed sleaziness, Gwen-65 angrily asks her counterpart how this is any better than asking hercreepy science professor; Gwen-617 chiding her for whisper-yelling. Gwen-617 introduces herself, telling Stark that Gwen-65 is her sister \"Stacy Stacy\" and that they require his help on double-checking a revolutionary scientific theory. As Gwen-617 lays into the purple prose, Gwen-65 grows increasingly agitated and cuts Gwen-617 off, demanding to know if Stark wants to be part of the biggest scientific discovery since theNegative Zoneand threatening to go toReed Richardsif he doesn't.\nIn Stark's lab, he andAnt-Mango over Gwen-617's calculations, Pym asking Stark if he's showed Reed to Stark's derision. Waiting in the hall outside, Gwen-65 unconvincingly remarks that she's seen crazier things than the thin spots in the boundaries between dimensions. Stark exits the lab and states that he and Ant-Man agree that the Gwens have found \"a precious pearl\" of a scientific discovery, asking what led them to it. Gwen-617 awkwardly attempts to explain without giving Gwen-65's identity away, but Gwen-65 cuts her off and states she knows someone who traversed the Multiverse by punching through brittle spots. Stark wonders why they need him if they're so certain, and Gwen-617 remarks that she ran the math throughEmpire State University's ancient supercomputer and wanted to get it checked out. Stark sneers at the benefits of math, asking if she thinks Reed Richards,Bruce Banner, orVictor von Doomgot where they are now because of math. Cutting across Gwen-617 incredulously asking if Doctor Doom is really one of his positive examples, Stark asks if they are prepared to risk everything to prove their theory is even partially true. Gwen-617 hesitates, but Gwen-65 responds affirmatively. Rummaging in his pockets, Stark remarks their thin spots are just a wild theory without something from another dimension to use for calibration, but remarks that he's rich enough to invest in long-shots as he tosses them a device.\nlater, Gwen-617 and Venom stand at the base of theBrooklyn Bridge, Gwen-617 responding to Venom's incredulity by stating that the boundary between dimensions is thinnest just above the surface of the water. Venom hopefully suggests swimming, but Gwen-617 states she'd need to hit it at a high velocity to punch through. Noting Venom's dismay, Gwen-617 asks her what's wrong; but Venom assures her that it's nothing. Gwen-617 volunteers to accompany her, but Venom refuses - saying that if they're wrong the impact could kill her. When Venom refuses, Gwen-617 states it's obvious that something's terrified her, though she's not sure whether it's because of Gwen-65 being convinced thatsomething terrible is going to happen to her at this spotor because of their mutual failure-complex; stating they need to face this together. Giving Gwen-617 the finger, Venom reluctantly acquiesces and carries her to the top of the bridge. Gwen-65 thanks Gwen-617 for helping her come to terms with herself, Gwen-617 asking her to promise to never lose sight of how lucky she is no matter what the future has in-store. Gwen dives off the bridge and punches through the barrier between dimensions.\nNarrating these events, the middle-aged Gwen-617 remarks to the Watchers that her meeting with Gwen-65 changed her fate and inspired her to move forward along a new path, using her scientific acumen to become a police detective and taming the Venom symbiote to become a superhero; later finding out about the shared fate of so many other Gwens across the Multiverse. Utaa accuses Gwen-617 of instigating a temporal paradox to bring about her own existence, but Gwen-617 remarks that the Watchers should know better than anyone that the Multiverse isa webwith many intersecting strands. Gwen-617 remarks that Earth-65 was going down a dark and toxic path, closing itself off to the infinite possibilities; and that to ensure its future remained unwritten they intervened. Utaa asks if she's referring to herself and the Venom symbiote, but Charlotte snidely retorts that Gwen-617 is talking about all the Gwen Stacies of the Multiverse, including her mother. Realizing the implications, Utau asks why the Spider-Gwens avoided taking part in theTotem War; but Gwen-617 asks how he could forget that Gwen-65 was involved. Outraged at the existence of a multiversalCouncil of Spider-Womenkept secret from the Watchers, Utaa accuses them of committing criminal conspiracy to undermine the fabric of reality; Gwen-617 sarcastically responding that all they really conspire to do is have brunch. When she admits to having removed Gwen-65 from her timeline to prevent her from reneging her decision to spare Matt Murdock, Utau furiously confronts her only to be rebuked for the dereliction of his duties. Calling up a map of the Multiverse, Gwen-617 commends Utaa for sensing the skeins of Earth-65 being reshaped into something new; adding he seems disappointed that his fears of Earth-8 becoming a dystopia at the hands of a sinister villain were unfounded. Gwen-617 dares the Watchers to use their ability to warp time and space in order to try something new and unpredictable. Before she can continue, herDimensional Travel Watchdings, alerting her to a crime in-progress in her homeworld. Hugging Max and Charlotte goodbye, Gwen-617 says she'll take them with her when they're older -- adding or when their mother's not looking in a whisper. As she steps through the portal, Gwen-617 addresses the two Watchers, telling them that while she can't judge them for fighting to protect what they care about they should stop expecting the multiverse to follow set paths and appreciate the myriad of infinite possibilities that change brings.\nOn Earth-65,J. Jonah Jamesonsits at his desk and asks why Venom chose to come to him rather than the police. Venom responds that she doesn't trust the police anymore, nor does she trust Jameson - who was the one responsible for pinningPeter Parker's death on her without evidence and instigated the manhunt against her for the sake of publicity. However, Venom notes that she chose to come forward to him because he was involved right from the start, and trusts that he won't walk away from an exclusive exposé interview revealing the truth about Spider-Woman - unmasking herself as Gwen Stacy.\nGWENOM PART 6\n• Gwen’s on a one-way road into darkness. If anyone can help her find her way back into the light…\n• It’s. GWEN. STACY."

Griping that fighting crime is so much easier than romance, she transformsher symbioteinto an elegant red dress. As her nerves change to excitement, Harry calls out to her, dressed in a suit and holding a bouquet of flowers. As Harry remarks at how amazing she looks, Gwen states her hair is a probably mess - Harry joking that she didn't take a cab. As Gwen thanks him for the flowers, Harry says they don't hold a candle to her beauty - acknowledging it's a corny cliche but nevertheless making her blush in happiness. As they enter the restaurant, Gwen internally scolds herself for becoming so easily flustered, not noticing symbiote-spiders dripping from her shoes. Inside the fancy restaurant, Harry helps her into her chair, Gwen trying to ignore the murderous glares the other clientele are unsubtly aiming at her by jokingly asking if the food is free due to the lack of prices on the menu. Harry replies that the food is very much the opposite of free, Gwen stating she'd be perfectly happy with just a corndog, Harry saying that the braised pork shank on a bed of polenta is similar to a corndog. One of the waiters interrupts their banter by politely informing him that while the restaurant greatly appreciates his patronage, they humbly request that he find an alternative establishment for the evening; bluntly telling him and Gwen to leave when Harry asks what he means. As Harry expresses indignant bemusement as to why, Gwen tells him that it's probably because of her and asks the server if it's because she's a criminal or a superhero. The waiter snootily tells her they avoid \"that word\", Gwen assuming he means \"criminal\" and indignantly asking why when the majority of the restaurant's clientele are white-collar criminals - the symbiote resonating with her barely-suppressed anger. When the server coldly informs her that he was referring to the word \"hero\", Gwen furiously storms out. Harry chases after her and asks if she's all right, but Gwen tells him that she's not and doesn't even know what that phrase means anymore. Gwen demands to know why people still hate her when she's saved the city numerous times, done time in a maximum security prison, and buried numerous friends and loved ones. Gwen laments choosing to return toEarth-65when so many other universes are in desperate need of superheroes, asking when her universe is ever going to pay back her sacrifices by choosing her. Harry protests that he chose Gwen, but Gwen sadly replies that she can't put him through what she's suffered - transforming her dress into her Spider-Woman costume and web-swinging away. Lamenting that she doesn't get to have a normal romance or easy life, Gwen laments that she chose to be a hero while letting the city label her a villain, and now has to deal with the messy consequences.\nDeciding to vent her angst with some good old-fashioned crimefighting, Gwen locates a trio of thugs and trounces them before webbing them up for the police - internally monologuing that fighting crime is so much simpler than other forms of hero work because she doesn't have to think, just act; and that she doesn't have to worry if the people she's interacting with hate her when it's made obvious by  her beating them up and them trying to kill her. Sitting horizontally on a billboard, Gwen laments having ever thought she could live a normal life after returning fromwar, only to a receive a notification from her odd-job website. Incredulity giving way to gleeful excitement, Spider-Woman web-swings to the specified residence, chiding herself to behave professionally. She rings the buzzer and informs the person who sent the request - Louis - that she has arrived, griping for the umpteenth time that she needsa new codenamewhen he calls her \"Spider-Gwen\". Louis is surprised that she actually showed up but says he'll come right down, Spider-Woman leaning over to give some scratches to a nearby stray cat while she waits. Louis answers the door, remarking that he's amazed that she replied immediately and thought she'd be booked for years. Inwardly lamenting her business' slow start, Spider-Woman asks what he wants of her and Louis says he needs help getting some high-elevation air quality samples. Taking his device, Spider-Woman web-swings through upper reaches of the concrete jungle and returns it to him. The next day, she's called to rescue a cat stuck in a tree. The day after that, selfies with a pair of teenage girls. On the third day, a teenage boy asks her out to spring formal and is bluntly rejected.\nOn Friday, Gwen goes on another date with Harry and tells him that theBetty Brantmanaged to get the band a major gig and thatEm Jay Watsonis proclaiming this to be theMary Janes' big comeback. Harry tells her to let him know when it's happening so he can get front-row tickets, jokingly expressing jealousy at her getting invited to prom by another boy. Growing serious, he asks Gwen if she's still having migraines and when she says no chidingly accuses her of lying. Harry strongly recommends she go see a doctor, Gwen assuring him that she's fine and rolling her eyes when he says she worries about him. Gwen's phone goes off and she says that something urgent came up. Harry wryly asks if it's another selfie request, but Gwen tells him there's been a major vehicular accident.\nSpider-Woman arrives at the scene of the pileup, asking a pair of police officers if one of them requested her. Surprised that she actually showed up, the cops inform her that they're not sure how the accident started but that it's bad and could get worse at any moment: fuel is leaking from the vehicles and they need special equipment that takes precious time to arrive that they don't have, pointing to where a distraught woman is begging an officer to let her go look for her missing daughter. As Spider-Woman leaps into action, the police officers hope that they did the right thing and that Captain Stacy will kill them if he finds out.\nSurveying the pileup from an elevated position, Spider-Woman weaves a massive web she can walk across without burning herself on the hot metal. Her migraine begins acting up, and she struggles to focus as she makes her way over the tangled mess of shredded vehicles, spotting a young girl stuck inside one. Descending on a web-line, Spider-Woman asks the girl to unlock the door, assuring the girl that she's not a threat and will take her to her mother. The girl hesitantly opens the door and introduces herself as Eisely, throwing her arms around Spider-Woman in a hug of desperate terror-turned-relief. As Spider-Woman makes her way back up to her web, assuring Eisley that she's safe now, she hears a faint voice calling out for help and sees a hand waving amidst the wreckage. Worried that she'll find the worst, Spider-Woman deposits Eisley on the web and tells her to stay put and hold on tight. Making her way over, she sees a cyclist pinned underneath a car and surrounded by pools of gasoline and asks if he can still feel his legs. The man tells her he can, so Spider-Woman carefully lifts the car off him and cocoons him in webbing just to be safe - afraid she might be hurting him in the process. As Gwen picks him up, a nearby pool of gas ignites and she leaps back up to the web, grabbing Eisley and racing her and the cyclist clear the ensuing explosion. Depositing the cocooned cyclist, Gwen tells the police that he was injured and needs medical attention, apologizing for being unable to stop the fire. The police say that was inevitable and offer to pay her, but Spider-Woman insists she doesn't take payment for saving lives. The police thank her profusely, and Spider-Woman off back into the city.\nArriving at home well after dark, Gwen ponders the troubling nature of her chronic migraines and wonders who's enough of a science nerd to help her determine what's causing them. She dismissesReed Richardson account of his youth, andCindy Moondue to her still being in prison and not knowing how her current powers work. Realizing there's only one person in the world who does, she calls Harry and asks if he can arrange an urgent meeting withDoctor Elsa Brock.\n• Struggling to find her place as SPIDER-WOMAN in a city that seems to revere her and hate her in equal measure, GWEN STACY has taken matters into her own hands by becoming a hero for hire!"

As Gwen and Em Jay bicker, Em Jay's girlfriend and the band's keyboardistGlory Grantintercedes and chastises Em Jay for being mean. As Em Jay's attention is diverted, Gwen's former roommate and the band's bassistBetty Brantsuggests they sneak out for corn dogs. Before they can do so, Em Jay swipes Gwen's drumsticks and scolds her for thinking of sneaking out of band practice. Gwen internally laments that the Mary Janes have somewhat lost their touch, but that they'll get their groove back sooner or later. After practice ends, Gwen tells the others she's meetingHarry Osbornfor dinner, Em Jay bidding her good night.\nNoting that time heals all wounds and that sooner or later she'll recover from the trauma ofthe second war with the Inheritors, Gwen transformsher symbioteinto her Spider-Woman costume and web-swings over the city. Despite disliking the nickname \"Spider-Gwen\" given to her by the press, Gwen expresses relief that she gave up having a secret identity. Wondering why she keeps checking for witnesses before changing into her civilian identity as she shapeshifts the symbiote back into civilian clothes, Gwen supposes it's just force of habit and that it's better to be too cautious than not cautious enough. Spotting Harry waving to her, Gwen crosses the street and is congratulated for being on time for once, Harry teasing her when she says she's practicing punctuality. Gwen states that bad things can happen if someone's not there to prevent them - referring to her father's coma two years prior - but Harry offers to buy her a milkshake to lighten the mood. Gwen teasingly asks him if they're suddenly in the 1950s, Harry quipping that milkshakes are timeless. When Harry asks if she's alright and calls her out on trying to blow him off with an \"I'm fine.\", Gwen apologizes for running off on their first date and tells him about theInheritors, and that when the war ended she spent the week jumping from dimension to dimension letting the fallen spider-avatars' friends and loved ones know what happened to them. Harry tells her what she did was the very essence of being a hero, and as Gwen thanks him he buys her another milkshake. As Gwen web-swings away, thinking to herself that she did it because someone had to, she notices a woman waving at her from an apartment rooftop. As the woman runs up, Spider-Woman asks if something is wrong and the woman says her brother said he'd seen her swinging past and needs her help. Spider-Woman is suspicious but notes that her Spider-Sense isn't telling her something's wrong. The woman says she lost her purse, and when Spider-Woman notes that's something to go to the police the woman says she's illegally subletting a friend's apartment and doing that would get them both evicted. Agreeing to keep an eye out, Gwen internally laments that this sort of thing probably never happens toSpider-Man.\nArriving home, Gwen notes that she should probably look into getting her own place again, but that for the time being it's great to be back. She calls out to her father, andGeorge Stacyreplies that he's in the kitchen. George asks how her rehearsal and date with Harry went, and Gwen replies that both were good before eagerly asking what he's cooking and saying she worked up an appetite again. George grouses over her web-swinging home until she points out there are no muggers in midair, telling her to set the table for dinner. Gwen notes that just sitting and eating dinner with her dad is probably what her life would have been like had she not become Spider-Woman, but her train of thought is derailed when she notices zucchini in her spaghetti. George remarks that his doctor put him on a health-food diet, quipping that it's good he's doing the cooking when Gwen expresses disgust. George states that he can tell something's bothering her that she doesn't want to talk about, stating he used to have the same expression when he couldn't tell her mother about his job. As Gwen hugs him, George asks if she's going to go back to college, and Gwen says that she is and that it's time to start planning for the future.\nAt the community college the next day, Gwen stands outside the registrar's office wrestling with anxiety. Two girls approach and ask if she's Gwen Stacy, and their excitement when she says she is overwhelms Gwen's already frayed nerves. As she runs from the college, Gwen berates herself for ever thinking she could have a semblance of a normal life after revealing her secret identity and serving time in prison. As she frets over what she's going to tell her father, Spider-Woman sets out to return home but something triggers her spider-sense. Glancing down to see an open door in an alley, Spider-Woman drops down to investigate and finds herself inside a jewelry store in the process of being robbed. Noting the cameras being disabled indicates an inside job, Spider-Woman trounces the robbers and is pleasantly surprised when the rescued hostages start cheering. Deciding to try looking for the woman's missing purse, Spider-Woman sends out a swarm of the Venom symbiote's constituent spiders and finds it inside a dumpster. The woman is overjoyed, though Spider-Woman informs her that her wallet was stolen, and insists on paying her. Returning home, Gwen wonders if she could make a job out of being a superhero - not charging for things like saving lives or defeating villains, but for minor tasks and odd jobs. Deciding to give it more thought in the morning, she collapses onto her bed and immediately falls asleep - the Venom symbiote extruding a spider onto her cheek.\nIn an abandoned building, the would-be jewelry store robbers are berated by their failure, protesting that it was Spider-Woman's fault and that she was supposed to be gone. Their employer mocks their inability to defeat a child, and when one of them states they could rule the city if she was gonetheir bosssays their next mission will be taking out Spider-Woman."

Stating he grew up here, Hobie remarks that the city will paint over it sooner than later but that for the time being Spider-Woman has joinedLuke Cageas a member of \"Hobie's Hometown Heroes\". Castle chuckles at this and remarks that if Spider-Woman ever was a hero she's something else now. Angered, Hobie packs up his supplies and retorts that he paints what inspires him, challenging Castle to name one story where the hero isn't dead.\nAt a seedy bar in Hell's Kitchen, Gwen Stacy - theVenom symbiotetransformed into a face-hiding black hoodie, black pants, and a red T-shirt - laments how her \"tough choices\" used to be easy - the symbiote interjecting with lazy or gluttonous options. She interrogates the Enforcers about the whereabouts of theRhino.Fancy Danrebukes her, sneering that Aleksei thinks he can call himself a supervillain after fighting Spider-Woman once. As Gwen clenches her fist and shouts at them to reveal where the Rhino is, she inwardly laments that her dark thoughts and impulses were once nothing more than whispers subdued by her father's instructions to always do what's right. The Enforcers move to attack her, Fancy Dan lamenting that she can't say he didn't try to not be a stereotype.Montanalassos Gwen only to be tossed through the bar. Gwen casually catchesOx's punch and shatters his knuckles with her grip, noting that now every choice is impossible and the voices of her dark impulses no longer whisper but scream. Transforming, Venom snarls that she'll try it their way and speak their language. Recalling all the decisions and events that led up to this point, Venom curb-stomps the Enforcers and grabs Fancy Dan by the throat, demanding to know where the Rhino is and preparing to punch his face in when he refuses to answer. Smashing a crater into the bar instead, Venom picks up a dropped quarter and puts it into a jukebox to soothe the symbiote's bloodlust.\nAt the Dollar Dog,Mary Jane Watsonangrily confronts a young man with his hair tied up in a large bun who posits that Gwen Stacy is Spider-Woman, threatening to punch his teeth in if he doesn't shut up. WhenMr. Albiecomes out to see what's going on, Em Jay rounds on him and demands that he help them. Mr. Albie remarks that he heard on the news that Gwen's father was arrested and then beaten into a coma because of his involvement with Spider-Woman; noting that Em Jay is right to be upset with people spreading rumors but that truth or not Spider-Woman cost him his business and he can't risk such troubles again. Mr. Albie offers a compromise, telling Em Jaye he'll post the fliers and notify them if he sees Gwen... after he calls the police. As they leave,Betty Brantnotes she'd have cut the guy for no reason and asks Em Jay why she was so angry when she'd been saying Gwen was Spider-Woman for weeks. Em Jay remarks that Betty saw how Mr. Albie reacted, that a lot of people hated Spider-Woman even before she became Venom, and that she doesn't want to think about what will happen if people start realizing that Gwen and Spider-Woman/Venom are one-in-the-same.\nIn the Jack's on Yancy's pub, the Rhino laughs atMatt Murdockasking if he's afraid. Rhino declares that he trampledCaptain Stacylike Murdock had told him to and is now a wanted man, so it makes sense for him to lie low. Murdock notes that it looks like Rhino is scared now that Spider-Woman is on a warpath. Rhino smugly tries to blackmail Murdock by threatening to provide evidence that he is theKingpinof Crime unless he pays hush money; but Murdock laughs and informs Rhino that Captain Stacy wasn't just any cop but a father-figure not only for half the NYPD but for Spider-Woman herself, and that there's only so long that even the Kingpin can protect him from her rage.\nVenom cocoons Fancy Dan in webbing and dangles him upside-down from a flagpole, the symbiote trying to persuade Gwen to sever the webline and let him fall to his death. Dan demands to know why she's doing this to him when he's a nobody who doesn't know anything. Chuckling menacingly, Venom remarks that she thought he was a big man and that making an example out of him should make his friends in the underworld more talkative, using a claw to slowly cut the strands comprising the webline. Terrified, Dan protests that he does know things and can help her; and Venom furiously asks how someone like him could help her, the symbiote telling her to kill him anyway. A smoke bomb goes off behind her and Otomo of the Hand appears; and as Venom turns to confront him the ninja sneers at how quickly she succumbed to the symbiote but tells her he didn't come to fight. Instead, Otomo tosses a matchbox from Jack's on Yancy's pub and informs her that he bears a message from the Kingpin: the Rhino is no longer under the Hand's protection and if she wants him she's welcome to him. Venom incredulously asks if Murdock is joking, since she knows he masterminded everything and that all this is on his head. Brandishing his katana, Otomo tells her that vengeance for Captain Stacy is hers and he suggests she takes advantage of the Hand's magnanimity while the offer lasts. Frank Castle observes the conversation through binoculars, while - ignored by Otomo and Venom - Fancy Dan calls out for help as the last strands of the webline holding him up break.\nMurdock notifies the NYPD that Spider-Woman is headed to Jack's on Yancy Street, causing the officers to break out riot gear. In Jack's pub, Murdock smugly offers to buy a drunk and depressed Rhino another pickleback round, Aleksei lamenting how easy he is to be manipulated. Venom arrives and furiously confronts Rhino, shouting that he owes her blood and she's come to make him pay. Murdock cheerfully stands up and says this is his cue to leave as Rhino incredulously asks what happened to her. Venom snarls that she's not letting Murdock go anywhere and that he's next; but Murdock uses the dimensional portal watch to make his escape, remarking that he was the one who gave her the power to seek revenge in the first place and asking her whether she's going to use waste this moment to avenge her father pursuing him or punish the persondirectlyresponsible for her father's coma.\nFrank Castle watches through binoculars as the NYPD arrive at the bar, noting that sometimes a battle must be sacrificed to win the war. As the brawl between Venom and Rhino spills out into the street, Castle laments that he let Murdock manipulate him into wasting his time chasing his own demons and picking fights with Spider-Woman. As Venom garrotes Rhino with a webline and tries to strangle him, the NYPD officers fire tear gas at them, ready their sonic batons, and set up a camera. Gwen realizes this was a setup to discredit her father's case and finally get the proof they want that she is a murderer, but the symbiote snarls that they don't care. Using the tear gas as cover, Castle punches out one of the NYPD officers and takes his sonic baton and gas mask. The Punisher smashes the sonic baton into Venom, stripping Gwen of the symbiote. As she reels from the blow and demands to know what he's doing, the Punisher tells her to stand down and charges his War Machine gauntlet, blasting a hole into the Rhino's chest. Looking down at the Rhino's corpse, Spider-Woman seethes that the Rhino was hers to kill and demands to know why he stole her revenge. As the symbiote re-bonds to her, the NYPD agents ask Castle what they should do, and he tells them to run as Venom lets out a scream of rage.\nAt Captain Stacy's hospital room,Ben Parkerfuriously rants toMayaboutD.A. Foggy Nelson's gall, snapping that if he'd done his job the Rhino would've never been on the street, much less in Captain Stacy's cell. May tries to calm him, but he snaps that this is Peter all over again; lamenting that his best friend is in a coma and all he's done is pray for some greater power to intercede and fix everything. May spots the latest issue of the Daily Bugle - the front page blaming the Venomized Spider-Woman for the Rhino's death - and says that Ben is right. Saying that all this started with Spider-Woman and that she is the key to ending it, May tells Ben that they need to find Gwen Stacy as she's going to need all the help she can get.\nSitting alone overlooking the nighttime cityscape, Gwen mulls over her rage at not being able to kill the Rhino herself and despairs that she wanted to do so more than anything she's ever wanted before, crying as she realizes just how much the Venom symbiote is corrupting her and that she needs to get it out of her before she becomes a monster.\nFeatured Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nGWENOM Part 1"

As Em Jay tries to get up to answer it, Gloria complains that her girlfriend had the gall to set an alarm and is letting cold air under the covers. Grumbling that it's not an alarm, Em Jay says that she set up alerts to notify her about news regarding theMary Janesand is shocked by what she sees.\nIn his penthouse apartment, Matt Murdock is interrogated via conference call by the leaders ofthe Hand- who berate him for putting them at risk of exposure through his public conflicts with Spider-Woman andthe Punisher. Murdock sneers at them, and when they berate and threaten him for his irreverence he tells them to bring it on and quips that he'll walk away in slow motion as they explode behind him. As the Hand leaders snap that he's nothing without them, Murdock hangs up on them and tosses his smartphone into the garbage as it starts ringing, bitterly thinking that he's seen worse than anything they can throw at him.\nAt the Parker Residence,Ben Parkerargues withMay Parker, snapping that he meant every word he'd said to Gwen and would say it all again in a heartbeat; storming out of the house and stepping on a copy of theDaily Bugleouting Gwen Stacy as Spider-Woman.\nAt the theatre, Gwen stares at the spiders comprising her symbiote as they weave a web between her fingers, Em Jay calling out that her calling a band practice instead of missing one is a twist even if she's supposed to be \"super bad and bougie\" now. The four members of the Mary Janes hug each other, Betty noting that some of the Venom symbiote got on them in the process; Em Jay remarking that they're more like black gummy spiders than slime. When Em Jay asks if the symbiote is dangerous, Gwen explains that it resonates with and amplifies its host's emotions and that inputting negative emotions like rage is what causes it to become violent and corruptive. Glory and Em Jay ask why she suddenly went public with her identity, Gwen sitting on the stage and saying that while it might seem sudden to them she put a lot of thought into it. Gwen explains that her father thought that if he was honest and explained everything, people would see Spider-Woman as a good person trying to do good things; but that honesty is not the same thing as truth, and that she was afraid that her father would find out that his outlook was naive the hard way - getting up on stage only to be dismissed by the uncaring world. Em Jay asks why she'd even bother telling her side of the story if that was the case, and Gwen replies that it's because she's afraid that Murdock is right about power being corruptive and that if she's not made accountable for her misdeeds - accidental or not - it will corrupt her too. Gwen states that she hopes that the people she's affected will weigh her side of the story against theirs and be able to learn from her mistakes. Betty drags the group into another hug, Em Jay saying they're all waiting for the \"but...\" part of her big speech. Gwen states that the \"but...\" part is that Murdock stole her dimensional portal watch and can use it to go anywhere he wants in the Multiverse to make a fresh start. The Mary Janes agree that they can't let that happen and volunteer to help Gwen take him down, Gwen stating she thought they'd never ask - calling out toReed Richards, who is setting up a sound system. Reed remarks that all systems are go, and the Mary Janes break out their instruments.\nElsewhere, Murdock - covered in cuts and stabbed in the gut by a katana - cuts down a squad of Hand ninja sent to assassinate him. As he checks the sword impaling him, Venom appears out of the shadows and hisses that she'd love to rub salt in his wounds. Murdock is surprised to see her alive, Venom mockingly referencing Alanis Morissette's song \"Irony\". Murdock notes she's back to using first-person pronouns, and Gwen retracts her mask and points out he's the last person who should be questioning her state of mind. When Murdock quips about her obsession with him, Gwen remarks that his criminal empire is crumbling around him like a house of cards but he makes it sound like a game of 52 pick-up. Murdock mocks her smug attitude as he pulls the sword from his abdomen, stating that he could have gone anywhere he wanted with his portal watch but that he chose to stay and keep trying to teach her how power corrupts. Gwen mocks Murdock for lying to himself and secretly wanting to be stopped, for being so bored and empty that only other people's misery is interesting, and for thinking himself caged when he's the freest person in the world. Enraged, Murdock attacks her, but she easily evades and says she's done playing his games. Gwen pulls out a music player and activating it, the Mary Janes' music blaring loud enough to incapacitate Murdock and blast the symbiote from Gwen's body. As Gwen notes that it must be terrifying for him to be so overwhelmed and drowned out, Murdock threatens to kill her unless she shuts it off. Gwen admits that she too once thought she could hide behind a mask, like the backbeat in a song, but that there's no hiding from oneself. Gwen tells Murdock that in telling her that sound was the Venom symbiote's weakness he gave his own critical vulnerability away, noting that deep down hewantedher to figure that out and stop him. Turning off the music, Gwen states that the world now knows the truth about the both of them, and that her love for her friends has helped her truly tame the Venom symbiote - which she transforms into a replica of her original costume. Asking Murdock what she should do with him, she transforms her left hand back into Venom's claws and tells him to give her a reason to not end things in bloodshed. Murdock swears he'll never surrender to her or the Hand, telling her to kill him or he'll never stop tormenting her. Gwen unceremoniously takes her dimensional portal device back and tells Murdock he picked his fate before leaving him to wait for more Hand ninja to arrive.\nThe Dollar Dog is surrounded by squads of armed police, as inside Spider-Woman andDetective Jean DeWolffsit at a booth engaged in small-talk. Jean quips that she knew Gwen was Spider-Woman the whole time and even bet on her in the office pool, telling Gwen that for what it's worth she knows her father would be proud of her. Gwen thanks DeWolff and holds out her hands, allowing the detective to place her under arrest.\nTHE SECRET IS OUT!\n• Spider-Woman IS Gwen Stacy!\n• Will going public fix the timeline — and more important, will it get Gwen out from under the Kingpin’s thumb?"

She asked him to repair her web-shooters, but it proves very difficult for him. He also notes that she has only five power-ups, when she remembered having six. Kraven stole one of them and handed it to Castle, who arrives at Oscorp with it. Castle convinces a reluctant Norman Osborn to assist him with catching Spider-Woman, in exchange for clearing Harry's name. Gwen, desperate for help, asks Jesse Drew for assistance, but the file he sent her appears to be useless. Unable to offer much assistance, he suggests that she run away with her father, but Gwen knows that travelling to another universe would only leave her with its own problems. She considers her other options, but none seem useful (Jessica has risked too much helping Gwen already, Cindy is occupied with her own issues, Captain America won't help Gwen if she's powerless, and the police would arrest her immediately). Gwen considers Murdock's help when suddenly she is approached by the Bodega Bandit (Gwen assisted in his arrest without her powers). He tells her that people constantly tell him what he does is wrong, but nobody ever acts like it is, except Spider-Woman, and he admits that is does make him want to quit his profession. Inspired by this, Gwen works up the courage to confront Castle. George warns that taking on Castle is dangerous, but Gwen knows that she needs to stop him before Castle can make his story true and goes off to face him.\n• What is Gwen Stacy without Spider-Gwen?"

After Captain America disables the Lizards with her shield, she knocks Spider-Woman out with a single punch. A series of flashbacks reveal Captain America's origins as the sole survivor of Project Rebirth, foiling Arnim Zola's attempt to unleash an army of anthropomorphic rat Nazis but leaving herself adrift in the multiverse for seventy-five years in the process. Spider-Woman awakens to find herself handcuffed and Captain America standing over her, holding Pine Cone and demanding she answer some questions. Spider-Woman realizes she's handcuffed and tried to break them, but Captain America states they're made from Vibranium and the only way out of them is to tell the truth. Captain America demands to know Spider-Woman's connection to an organization called S.I.L.K. and who Doctor Connors is to her, pointing at a human Doctor Connors who is emitting green smoke. Spider-Woman is amazed that she cured him, but Captain America states that there is no cure, only a temporary suppressant. Spider-Woman is horrified, stating the Lizard can't be Peter's legacy, confusing Captain America, who states that the only link S.I.L.K. had to Midtown High was Connors. Spider-Woman tells her that Peter was the Lizard, but Doctor Connors awakens, slurringly stating that he remembers Peter and demanding to know what happened to him while transforming back into the Lizard. Captain America tells Spider-Woman to stay behind her as the Lizard attacks.\nOn the surface, Hawkeye watches from a rooftop as Jean DeWolff talks with Mr. Albie, and complains to Director Carter over a com-line over not being allowed to fight, but Director Carter gives him a direct order to not intervene or shoot anyone. Mr. Albie tells DeWolff they should let the Lizards be, but DeWolff states that she was asked to investigate by an old friend.\nIn the subway tunnel below, Spider-Woman webs Pine Cone to the ceiling and turns to see Captain America get slashed by the Lizard. She intervenes, telling him to take control and stop repeating Peter's name. She picks up Captain America's shield and uses it to deflect a blow, but has a flashback to Peter's death and drops the shield, collapsing to the ground. As the Lizard is about to attack her, DeWolff arrives and opens fire. Unharmed by the bullets, the Lizard lunges at her, but is slashed across the chest and knocked back by Redwing, Hawkeye's robotic falcon.\nCaptain America helps Spider-Woman up and tells her it's time to retreat, but Spider-Woman responds that she's not letting the Lizard get away to hurt others. Captain America retorts that she's out of her weight class, but Spider-Woman responds that she's not one of Captain America's soldiers and is here to help people, shooting two weblines at the ceiling above the Lizard. Watching Spider-Woman strain to bring the roof down, Captain America joins in on pulling, telling her to put her back into it. Together, they bring the ceiling down on the Lizard, who reverts back to being Doctor Connors.\nLater, Hawkeye berates Captain America for letting Spider-Woman go, but Captain America retorts there is a chain of command and then berates him for letting DeWolff follow him and compromise the site. Hawkeye responds that Director Carter cleared her, and DeWolff interrupts saying there is a direct link between her case and what S.H.I.E.L.D. has found. Pointing at Connors, she says that he disappeared when the Lizard incident happened and with the ongoing Spider-Woman manhunt there's been no effort put into finding him or the Lizard, stating that from the looks of it they're one-and-the-same. Captain America corrects her, stating that Connors was one of many test subjects turned into living weapons by a shadow cell called S.I.L.K., and that based on Spider-Woman's reaction the Midtown High Lizard was Peter Parker.\nAt the Parker household, Ben expresses confusion over George's statement, and George says that while he promised Ben and May he'd find Peter's killer and bring them to justice, he was removed from the case. He insist that Castle is wrong and that Spider-Woman is innocent, but that if he keeps pushing they'll take more than his badge away. Ben accuses him of quitting, but George states that he will find the truth, but that he's concerned that Ben and May might not be able to handle it. Ben snaps that he and May deserve to know what really happened to Peter, and that it's not George's job to protect them anymore.\nIn an alleyway, Spider-Woman perches on the edge of lid of the Bodega Bandit's dumpster, saying goodbye to Pine Cone. Noticing the Bandit approaching, she tells him to be careful since it was extremely difficult tying on a mask in handcuffs. She tosses Pine Cone - dressed in a bandit mask and hat - to the Bodega Bandit and swings off into the night, leaving him overjoyed and holding his new pet.\n• The Lizard is loose!"

While the long-haired Gwen mentions her creepy biology professor, Dr. Miles Warren, taught a semester on transgenics and cloning, Gwen-65 wonders if she's the Earth-616Gwen Stacyand debates warning her ofher future. As the long-haired Gwen continues speculating about Gwen-65's origins, Gwen-65 irately notes that she doesn't need another distraction and lashes out in anger,the symbiotesnarling that the long-haired Gwen is wasting their time. Gwen-65 gets up and leaves, telling her counterpart she doesn't have time for this, but the long-haired  Gwen follows her and asks why she freaked out. Gwen-65 snaps that every second she spends in this dimension risks her losing everything, transforming into Venom and snarling that she doesn't belong there. As Venom leaves, the long-haired Gwen ponders over her referring to herself as \"we.\"\nOverlookingEarth-8,Utaucomplains thatUtaadragged him away from Earth-65 just as things were starting to get interesting. Utaa pulls out a holographic map of theWeb of Life and Destiny, tracing one of the skeins of Earth-65 to where it intersects with one ofEarth-616's - the wedding of Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales - and diverges into Earth-8. Utaa explains that injuries to the space-time continuum affect the timeline like a disease - for instance Gwen-65 becoming Venom and setting out to killMurdockhas already resulted in a slew of new alternate futures. Recalculating the progression of Earth-8, Utaa notes that he's afraid the rot has already spread and that the utopian Earth-8 may soon be wiped from existence and replaced with a new, darker future. Utau sarcastically asks what they can do even if they find the one responsible for abducting the Gwen Stacy of Earth-65, but Utaa angrily retorts that someone or something has sabotaged his perfect utopia and that he intends to get revenge and/or set things right, even if it means breaking his oath of non-interference as a Watcher.\nIn the alternate universe, Venom lands on the side of the Baxter Building outsideReed Richards' lab and tries to get his attention, but is greeted by an automated message addressing her asSpider-Manand telling her to respect the Fantastic Four's privacy and direct all contact through the proper channels. As the automated message flatly states they're still not looking for a fifth member, Venom is zapped by electricity and falls into a dumpster, reverting to human form and landing atop a copy of a newspaper blaming Spider-Man for the death ofGeorge Stacy.\nElsewhere, Peter Parker greets the long-haired Gwen Stacy with a pair of ramen cups, but she is distracted and tries to play not laughing at his jokes off as just being tired from midterms. When she turns down his offer of a date, Peter drops the ramen in the garbage and leaves, wondering why he feels an eerie sensation as though someone's watching him. Gwen watches him go, noting that despite how sweet Peter is she can tell that he'skeeping a secretfrom her. Venom appears behind her, remarking that she never thought ofher Peterromantically, making it weird to see her counterpart in a relationship with him. Gwen's dimensional travel watch pegs the unknown dimension's designation asEarth-616.525, but immediately resumes recalculating its divergence from Earth-616. Venom fishes the ramen out of the trash, explaining that she's from another dimension, but the long-haired Gwen swats it from her hands and says they're going to get real food. At a hotdog stand, the long-haired Gwen peppers her short-haired counterpart with questions, while the latter tries to suppress her symbiote's ravenous hunger. Gwen-65 notes she's a musician rather than a science-major, vetoing the long-haired Gwen's suggestion of involving Peter and stating she already tried Reed Richards.\nGwen-65 apologizes for lashing out earlier, explaining that her symbiote gives her powers like Spider-Man's, but amplifies her negative emotions to the point she can't control them. As Gwen-65 grows agitated, the long-haired Gwen tries to soothe her; saying she knows how she feels. In response, Gwen-65 pulls out the newspaper proclaiming their father's death at the hands of Spider-Man and asks why her counterpart didn't tell her. The long-haired Gwen bitterly retorts she had no way of broaching the subject, noting that nothing will bring her father back and she doesn't have an evil alien entity to blame her anger and despair on. However, she states that Gwen-65's existence has shaken her out of her downward spiral, giving her proof that somewhere out there a different outcome exists. Gwen-65 has the epiphany that at leasther own fatheris still alive and that she could and should have stayed with him; admitting that she felt too scared, angry, and helpless to realize that. Despite this epiphany, however, she's still trapped in an alternate universe with no way home. The long-haired Gwen explains the principle of Schrödinger's cat and gives her Venomized counterpart some sage advice. When Gwen-65 asks how she can still be so positive after losing her father, the long-haired Gwen states that just knowing there's a world out there where she's a superhero is proof that anything's possible even for herself. The dimensional travel watch finally designates Gwen-65's location asEarth-617.\nOn Earth-8,Spider-BoyandSpider-Girlattack Utaa, who dismisses them as brats and freezes them in midair. Utau expresses shock at the notion that they could be behind Earth-65's corruption - having not even been born at the time - but Utaa refuses to be dissuaded. Utau interrupts Utaa's interrogation to inform him that a portal is opening above them, and a middle-aged Gwen Stacy appears and attacks the two Watchers before transforming intoVenom.\nGWENOM Part 6\n• To defeat THE KINGPIN, Gwen has to let VENOM win."

Leaving the thugs for thepolice, Spider-Woman web-swings away noting that lately something seems to be wrong with the symbiote - she's been suffering from agonizing migraines, and leaving pieces of it wherever she goes. The one person who could help her,Dr. Elsa Brock, has disappeared without a trace, and no-one can find her anywhere. Pulling out theTicket to the Multiverse, Gwen decides to look for help inEarth-616.\nOpening a portal, Gwen finds herself in midair overCentral Park. She latches onto a nearby wall, but her powers suddenly cut out and she plummets into a tree. Embarrassed and annoyed, she wonders if theWeb of Life and Destinynearly being destroyed is causing her spider-powers to desynchronize. Her symbiote refuses to respond to her, so she begrudgingly realizes she'll have to look forSpider-Manon foot. Climbing out of the tree, she awkwardly greets the passing civilians and asks for directions to the nearest library.\nAt theNew York Public Library, Gwen is shocked to see that Peter's recent history has been almost as turbulent as her own - losing his doctorate to plagiarism. Learning he's now a T.A. atEmpire State University, she sets out - happy to discover that her powers are working again. She finds Spider-Man waiting for her on the roof of the library, and he tells her that he set up a detector for interdimensional portals. Gwen tells him about the issues she's been having with her powers, and that she needs to findEddie Brockfor help with her symbiote. Spider-Man incredulously asks why she'd want to turn to Venom rather thanJessica DreworMiles Morales, and Gwen says that she knows they're busy and figured that Eddie would know more about symbiotes than anyone else - hoping that he'll be as smart as his gender-flipped Earth-65 counterpart. Peter dismisses Venom asa brain-eating monsterbefore offering to help Gwen himself and only turn to Venom as a last resort.\nGwen agrees to this plan, so the two set off; Gwen internally noting that she's missed fighting alongside her fellow spider-avatars. A bee flies past after their visit to ESU, setting off Gwen's spider-sense, and she wonders if her powers are acting up again. Peter asks her for more information on the symbiote-spiders she gave him, but her response is interrupted by the onset of a migraine. As Peter checks on her, Gwen informs him that eating soothes her headaches and that her symbiote burns through a lot of calories. Landing in Central Park, Peter offers to lead her to a hotdog stand and adds that the two of them being out in the open might draw Venom out of hiding. Another bee flies past, triggering Gwen's spider-sense yet again, and she complains about it to Peter before asking about the plagiarism case that cost him his doctorate. Peter quickly tells her that whileDoctor Octopushad swapped consciousnesses with him, he finished Peter's doctoral degree; however, since Otto had been the one who wrote it while in Peter's body, it still counted as plagiarism. Gwen expresses confusion at the convoluted series of events and chases after Peter, who ignores her and jogs towards the hotdog stand. Peter asks if they have hotdogs in Earth-65, and Gwen responds that they're probably ubiquitous across theMultiverse, though she grouses that they're inferior to corndogs before ordering two. Peter jokes that corndogs are carnie food, Gwen replying that superheroes are the carnies of the sky. Their discussion is interrupted by a scream coming from theAmerican Museum of Natural History, the two departing to investigate.\nInside the museum, a dinosaur skeleton covered in a swarm of bees and a tattered purple cloak lashes out at terrified civilians, Peter telling Gwen that their enemy isSwarm, a Nazi scientist who turned himself into a sentient swarm of bees. As Gwen mulls over the biological implications of that, Peter tells her that Swarm is likely after theUtahraptor ostrommaysorumskeleton he's taken over, as it's one of the few complete specimens. \"Dinoswarm\" spots them and complains about the appearance of yet another spider-hero. As they evade Swarm's fangs and claws, Gwen tells Peter that they need to wrap him up completely like a corndog to stop him. Her powers begin to short out, but she promises the symbiote she'll gorge it if it helps her and it aids her in covering a banner in webbing. Peter and Gwen wrap Swarm up in several banners and web the fossil's jaws shut, Gwen telling the frightened civilians that they're safe now. As a little girl asks who she is, Gwen decides to settle on a new codename and calls herself \"Ghost-Spider\". As the civilians depart, Gwen asks if thepolicecan handle Swarm, and Peter responds that they've developed tactics and technology for handling supervillains. Gwen takes note of this, and Peter promises to help her figure out what's going wrong with her powers.\nAs they head outside to buy more hotdogs, Peter asks Gwen what she plans to do about Elsa Brock. Gwen replies that Peter's Eddie Brock is a longshot unless he's a super-smart scientist, and that she'll wait to hear back from him about the tests he's running. Gwen considers enrolling at Earth-616's Empire State University, noting that she's been looking for a good school and that Peter still owes her a corndog.\nReturning to Earth-65, Gwen chides herself for forgetting that she has the whole Multiverse at her fingertips, and that it's time for her to remember just how open her options are.\n• After unmasking herself, waging a war for the fate of the Multiverse and nearly losing her father, Gwen Stacy has had a rough year...and it’s not about to get any easier!\n• ESPECIALLY when something’s started going wrong with the mysterious suit that gives her her abilities."

It manifests a fanged maw as she steels herself to be bonded to it, but it suddenly shoots past her towardsWolverineandShadowcat. Logan shields Kitty and tries to slice the symbiote to pieces with his Adamantium claws, but it reforms and latches onto him. Gwen recalls whatDr. Elsa Brockhad told her about the symbiote - that it typically kills its prospective hosts before it can fully bond to them and that it needs a compatible host. As she and Shadowcat look on in horror, Gwen laments that she believed that she was its only compatible host and that bonding to it was the price she'd have to pay to keep being Spider-Woman. Kitty asks if Logan is OK, and the Venomized Wolverine replies thattheyare better than ever as the symbiote forms into black samurai armor and sculpts his hair into a red-streaked horned hairdo. As SWAT police swarm in, Spider-Woman yells at them to stand back, but the Venomized Wolverine gleefully mows through them, embracing his long-suppressed bloodlust.\nAt the intensive care unit,District Attorney Foggy NelsoncallsMatt Murdockand snaps that he wantedGeorge Stacysilenced, not dead. Murdock quips that Captain Stacy isn't dead yet, just in a coma -- saying he got off light compared to what would have happened if he'd taken his stand. AsDetective Jean DeWolff- who is inside Captain Stacy's hospital room - turns to stare at him through the window, Nelson nervously tells Murdock that he thinks she's onto him. In an alleyway in Madripoor, Murdock sighs in exasperation and tells Nelson to calm down and get ready for what's coming next. As Nelson demands to know what he means, Murdock instructs him to have Captain Stacy's room heavily guarded, saying that Spider-Woman is still on the loose. Turning to Gwen Stacy's dropped backpack, Murdock jokes that she'd lose her head if it weren't attached as he steals herDimensional Travel Watch.\nExtending her own claws, Shadowcat lunges at Logan and tells him to stand down, but he smugly activates her restraining device before collapsing in pain himself -- the symbiote's aversion to loud noises kicking in. Watching, Gwen laments that the Logan's using the symbiote as an excuse to become the vicious killer he was deep down, and that it scares her that Murdock was wrong about her being the symbiote's only compatible host. As Gwen picks up the restraining device's activator, Gwen realizes they'll both die and that if she doesn't do anything she'll be a worse monster than the Venom could make her. Kitty begs her not to shut it off, but Gwen says that they'll both die if she doesn't and deactivates it. The symbiote rebonds to Logan and he runs off, Shadowcat berating Spider-Woman as she helps her to her feet. Shadowcat tells Spider-Woman that the device emits ultrasonic waves that inhibit her ability to turn intangible, and Spider-Woman speculates that the Venom symbiote has a mind of its own and is influencing Logan; suggesting that Shadowcat phase Logan free and then use the sonic inhibitor to destroy the symbiote. Shadowcat gripes that Spider-Woman's plan sucks, and Spider-Woman asks Kitty what will happen to Harry. Kitty quips thatNorman Osbornwill get him a good lawyer and keep him out of prison; picking up Logan's hat and giving it to Spider-Woman. Spider-Woman briefly puts the hat on before leaving it to cover Harry's face, Shadowcat saying she came to stop a monster and that her work's not yet done before the two women set off in pursuit of the Venomized Wolverine.\nAs Venomized Wolverine runs down an alley, Spider-Woman and Shadowcat arrive via web-swinging. He cuts Spider-Woman's web-line, but she tells Shadowcat to stick to the plan as she launches them towards Logan. Shadowcat phases Logan free of the symbiote, Spider-Woman noting that it was too easy. Logan comes to his senses and apologizes, telling Kitty that the symbiote got into his head; and the two S.H.I.E.L.D. assassins flee the scene as Spider-Woman holds the symbiote at bay with the sonic inhibitor. The symbiote is unaffected and breaks the device, latching onto Spider-Woman as she desperately tries to get it working again. As it engulfs her, Murdock arrives - singing along to the Mary Janes' \"Face It Tiger\" before gloating that if she'd called him he would have told her that sound only affects the symbiote when it has a host. Smugly stating that deep down shewantedthe symbiote to take over and unleash her darkest impulses, the Kingpin watches as the symbiote cocoons Gwen. Refusing to give in, Spider-Woman snares Murdock's smartphone and yanks it into the cocoon, playing her band's music. As the now Venomized Spider-Woman - dressed in a black bodysuit and jacket with a white spider-emblem on the back, a serrated white-rimmed hood, and the symbiote's tongue forming a jagged red pattern from her neck to her waist before extending into a whip-like appendage - emerges from the cocoon, Murdock smugly asks how she feels - thinking she's succumbed to the symbiote's corruption. Lunging at him, the Venomized Spider-Woman grabs him by the throat and slams him against a wall before transforming the symbiote into a replica of her original costume and saying that she feels great. Murdock is incredulous at her ability to resist the symbiote's bloodlust, Gwen retracting her mask and stating that Murdock himself gave her the key to that: using music to suppress the symbiote and let her control it. Murdock sarcastically congratulates her for finally winning before revealing that he's still ten steps ahead. Revealing he stole her portal device, Murdock mocks her for losing track of it and the other important things in her life as he opens a portal to George Stacy's hospital room. Horrified and enraged, Gwen tightens her grip on Murdock's throat as the symbiote shifts back to its dark appearance. Murdock chokes out that Captain Stacy's coma is her fault since she trusted the police to protect him instead of being there to do so herself. Dropping Murdock, Gwen dashes through the portal and crouches next to his bed, sobbing that this can't be happening. As the police burst into her room and hold her at gunpoint, Gwen's grief bleeds over into rage and the symbiote engulfs her. Livid, the Venomized Spider-Woman snarls that Captain Stacy was one of them, and that they were supposed to protect him. Hissing viciously, she lashes out with the symbiote's tongue and slams one of the cops into the wall. The other cop opens fire, but the symbiote withstands the bullets and the Venomized Spider-Woman breaks his hand with tendrils. As she grabs Detective DeWolff by the throat, Jean gasps that Spider-Woman won't help Captain Stacy by killing her. Dropping her, the Venomized Spider-Woman - her voice distorted by the symbiote - admits that DeWolff is right, then leaps out a window as she swears bloody revenge onthe one who put Captain Stacy in a coma.\n• The aftermath of the PREDATORS storyline leaves Gwen in a VERY different place.\n• Matt Murdock’s plans all come home to roost, and when you plan like our good friend Murderdock does, you know that ain’t pretty."

Pondering the ominous sensation she gets - as though the Storms are threatening her, she wonders how she should respond and whether to make an account on the website. Dropping to the floor, Gwen examines her reflection and addresses theVenom symbiote, asking it to make her clothes less ratty in exchange for a cheeseburger. The symbiote transforms into a black T-shirt and jeans, Gwen happily promising to add fries as a bonus. As she exits her bedroom to get them a healthy breakfast, she grumbles that it's unfair how she's stuck eating healthy food when her dad was the one who had a heart attack - not noticing the symbiote has left some of its constituent spiders behind.\nDownstairs, Gwen greets her father,George Stacy, and asks if he saw the news. George Stacy replies that he did and scolds her for recklessly charging into a burning building. Gwen counters that she saved a lot of people doing so and that the fire department had lost control of the blaze, irritably snapping that George's job as a cop puts him in danger all the time. George replies that her being a superhero isn't a job, Gwen retorting that he could retire with a full pension and get a job to make even more money any time he wanted before asking why he doesn't. As George replies that he made a commitment to the force, Gwen replies that she made a commitment to protecting the people of the city as well. George protests that it's not the same thing, but Gwen snaps that he became a cop when he was her age and that she's a legal adult who can make her own decisions. Continuing, Gwen states that across the Multiverse thepower of the spiderchosePeter Parkerbut onEarth-65it chose her instead. As the symbiote resonates with her anger by spawning lashing tendrils, Gwen shouts that she's not going to be a damsel in distress and that it shouldn't matter how old she is, just that she's willing to do what's right. Transforming intoher Venom form, Gwen snarls that she's doing the best she can and that people need to stop trying to stop her.\nGeorge asks Gwen to calm down, saying that he's not trying to stop her from being a hero, just that he's worried about her. Retracting the symbiote from her face, Gwen retorts that she worries about him too but would never ask him to leave the force because she knows how much being a cop means to him, stating that being Ghost-Spider means just as much to her. As George assures her that no-one is going to stop her from being a hero, Gwen decides to tell him about  theUnderage Superhuman Welfare Act, saying that thePeter Parkerof thePrime Marvel Universeoffered to sponsor her, but that she refused out of indignation and anger. Mulling this over, George states that parents worry about their children, and that this worry sometimes causes them to make mistakes; adding that he can't imagine whatKamala Khan's parents must be going through and that if anything had happened to her before he'd found out she was a superhero he would probably have done something similar. George adds that while being a superhero isn't the life he imagined for her, he's done his best to be understanding. Gwen wryly notes that being a superhero wasn't the life she'd imagined for herself either, but that they can't waste their lives dwelling onwhat might've happened if events had gone differently. Kissing her father goodbye, Gwen says she's going out on patrol and to check on theBodega Bandit.\nAs Ghost-Spider web-swings through the city, her phone goes off and she answers to findBetty Branton the other end. Ghost-Spider tells her friend that she's seen the Storms' video and is surprised to hear her website is blowing up with people demanding they team up. Gwen contemplates whether or not to accept the team-up offer, before deciding to do so - if only as a way to find out what's going on with them. Creating an account, Ghost-Spider poses for the camera and films herself accepting the Storms' offer - inwardly grousing that doing so is humiliating. Noting that Betty will be happy and her website will see more traffic, Gwen grumps thatMJwill accuse her of being full of herself before admitting that she'd probably be right, but that nevertheless she has to keep trying to help those who need her.\nArriving at the Bodega Bandit's hospital room, Ghost-Spider opens his window and steps inside. Waking up, the Bodega Bandit is happy to see her and teases her over the irony of her breaking the law to visit him. Ghost-Spider tells him they arrested the people who'd shot him, but the Bodega Bandit is more concerned aboutPine Cone- fretting that he might be eaten by a cat. Ghost-Spider assures him that she'll keep an eye out for the hamster, telling the Bodega Bandit to rest and focus on healing so she can go back to thwarting him. The Bodega Bandit cheerfully remarks he's looking forward to it, calling her his nemesis - and for once she doesn't refute this.\nAs Ghost-Spider web-swings across the city, noting her teachers will be mad at her for skipping school, her phone goes off again. Checking her email, she grumbles that people haven't noticed she's put her odd-jobs requests on hold and is grossed out by an offer to sponsor a dating website. Deleting the spam and junk mail, she notes that the Storms have posted a reply to her video.\nAt their apartment, Susan and Johnny film themselves stating that they're thrilled that Ghost-Spider has accepted their offer, but once they're done they begin bickering - Susan sneering that Johnny was acting like a slavering dog and Johnny snapping that she was trying to make the team-up a girl-power thing. Susan retorts that while Gwen is an idealist she isn't stupid, reminding him she was willing to go to prison because she felt bad about having accidentally hurt people. Johnny chimes in asking what they should do about their mother, who they had just murdered. Susan remarks that the real marble kitchen their mother was so proud of will make it a perfect crematorium. Levitating their mother's corpse with her powers, Susan asks if Johnny feels like burning something. Johnny gleefully agrees, setting his fist ablaze, and they carry their mother's corpse to the kitchen and burn it.\nLater, Ghost-Spider waits at the arranged meeting spot for the Storms to arrive, noting she feels like this is a bad idea. Setting off for a lap around the block, Ghost-Spider returns to find the Storms waiting for her - Susan dressed in a bodysuit and hooded green cloak, and Johnny wreathed in flames. Ghost-Spider's symbiote reacts negatively to the heat from Johnny's flames, Susan remarking that she doesn't feel like hugging him when he's all lit-up either. Hanging upside-down, Ghost-Spider asks why they wanted to team up, and Susan replies that Ghost-Spider is practically a veteran hero while they're new to their powers and want someone to show them the ropes. Ghost-Spider remarks that there isn't a lot of supervillain activity at the moment, with most of the major players being in prison. Susan and Johnny are shocked to learn thatMatt Murdockwas a villain, telling Ghost-Spider that he'd been their family's lawyer for years.\nWith no supervillains to fight, Ghost-Spider asks if they feel up for a patrol, Johnny remarking that it sounds like fun. As Johnny asks her to call him by his first name rather than \"Mister Storm,\" Susan tells Ghost-Spider that their father was a doctor before darkly stating they don't like doctors - having a flashback to their encounter withDoctor Doom, the dictator ofLatveria. As Ghost-Spider apologizes, Johnny tries to lighten the mood by saying it's not all bad since they have superpowers now - causing Ghost-Spider to ask if they got their powers through being experimented on. Susan and Johnny change the subject, and Ghost-Spider remembers thatMan-Wolf's gang has been stirring up trouble near the docks. When Ghost-Spider asks how they got their powers again, Susan replies that they'll have plenty of time for exposition later. As Ghost-Spider web-swings towards the waterfront, Susan and Johnny hang back - Johnny grousing that Ghost-Spider asks too many questions and can't be trusted, and Susan telling him not to overreact and that Ghost-Spider will be too star-struck to be suspicious of them.\nGhost-Spider perches on a shipping container, and when Johnny asks why she's just watching she tells him that they need to wait for definitive proof of illicit activity and warns him not to hurt the thugs too badly. As one of the thugs opens a shipping container to reveal a stash of drugs, Ghost-Spider leaps into action before noticing she's by herself. Irritated, she calls out to the Storms that team-ups mean they help out; Susan appearing beside her and Johnny blasting the thugs with a torrent of flame. As Susan mocks Johnny's \"Flame on!\" catchphrase, Ghost-Spider jokingly suggests \"It's clobbering time!\" and laughs when Susan groans that it's even worse. As they subdue the thugs, Susan asks what comes next and Ghost-Spider says they call the police, congratulating each other for a job well done. As the Storms fly away, Susan calls out for Ghost-Spider to DM her, Gwen retracting her mask and happily remarking that the twins are nicer than she thought they'd be."

Gwen was assignedJennifer Waltersas a defense attorney, and evenSpider-Hamwas brought in to testify on her behalf.District Attorney Foggy Nelsonlaments toGeorge Stacythat he unsuccessfully tried to get the case dismissed. Sitting in a jail cell, Gwen furiously denounces Nelson for having dropped the charges for murder and manslaughter related toPeter Parker's death after she refused to accept any bargains or plea deals. Walters explains that Nelson likely dropped the heaviest charges in order to avoid exposing his not-so-secret connections to theKingpin, Gwen lamenting that she wanted to be held accountable for all her misdeeds and that her actions have to have consequences. Urging Gwen to stop looking to other people for approval, Walters states that she knows all too well what it's like to think and feel that you can't be what other people believe is right. However, Walters states that she and the rest of the people in the courtroom are not superheroes and don't know or understand what being one is like, and therefore Gwen being tried by a jury of her peers is impossible. Walters states that Gwen thought she could prove her father right by doing what he'd wanted to do - going before a court and telling her side of the story - but that she's not her father and her words don't carry the same weight or influence as his; warning her that she's not on trial for what she's done but what Spider-Womanmightdo, and that people are terrified of her. Dejected by this, Gwen is brought the court a final time and sentenced to two years in theS.H.I.E.L.D. Maximum Security Prison- the same one she'd broken into as Venom.\nGwen notes that the security has been heightened since she was last there - prisoners being put in individual cells and outfitted with power-inhibitor chips. She's surprised that the inmates are allowed to interact with each other at all, but realizes that S.H.I.E.L.D.wantsto have incidents happen so as to learn from them. SpottingCindy Moonin the mess hall, Gwen goes to sit with her only for her old enemy to snap at her to go away and furiously ask if she's trying to get them both killed. As Gwen stammers that she thought they might be prison buddies, Cindy immediately shuts her down and calls her fresh meat. As Gwen calls after her, a food tray smashes into her face and sends her sprawling, an inmate namedTitaniafuriously shouting that she's sick of all the new inmates attacking her to establish tough reputations for themselves and decided to go for a preemptive strike. Fading into the crowd, Cindy tells Gwen that the first rule of prison is to get a reputation of being as mean and vicious as possible as quickly as possible so as to be left alone, preferably by attacking someone bigger and meaner than you and hoping they don't kill you. As Titania smashes Gwen through a table, Cindy tells Gwen that if she doesn't want to have every inmate going after her she has to make them fear her. As Titania snarls at her to stand up and fight back, Gwen starts to transform into Venom before her inhibitor collar kicks in. As guards subdue Titania, Gwen declares that she's done fighting but is bashed over the head with a stun baton and knocked out.\nIn her cell, Gwen laments that she didn't really care whether she was found guilty or innocent, only that she got a fair trial. Sneering at her own naivety, Gwen wonders how many of the other inmates - even ones she fought in the past, like Cindy Moon,Frank Castle, andKitty Pryde- really deserve to be locked away forever; noting that she got off easy compared to them thanks to Foggy Nelson's meddling and her father's status, and everyone knows it. A guard fetches Gwen, who asks where they're going and is zapped for her trouble. Dazed and struggling to suppress the angry symbiote, she is tossed into the dark exercise room and promptly punched in the face. Knocked to the ground, several other inmates kick and beat her, telling Gwen that she's wrong if she thinks they'll get bored of attacking her if she doesn't fight back. A pink-hared woman calledDiamondbacksays that Gwen's friendCaptain Americagot her and her gang - the Serpent Society - arrested. Holding a toothbrush shiv to Gwen's neck, the Diamondback says that her gang embodies the Ouroboros - with no beginning and no end - and are going to make Gwen wish there was an end to the suffering they're about to inflict. Before she can attack, her shock collar is activated and theVulturesteps out of the shadows. Diamondback protests that she paid him for the time, and Vulture retorts that she'll get what she paid for one day. As Gwen is revolted by the rasping sound of his voice, the Vulture dismisses Diamondback and her gang - holding up a shock collar activator as added incentive for them to leave. Gwen asks Toomes why he saved her, and Toomes remarks that she was right about him just wanting to feel special, and that now she owes him for saving her and knows that he could have her humiliated or killed on a whim.\nOver the next two weeks, Gwen is randomly attacked by the Serpent Society - sometimes out in the open and sometimes as ambushes, the guards doing nothing to intervene. Lamenting the sense of paranoia she's starting to develop, Gwen wonders if the guards let the attacks happen because they were paid off by Toomes, because they're just as trapped and bored as the inmates, or if they're getting orders from higher up the S.H.I.E.L.D. food chain. During yard time, Gwen warily eyes the Serpent Society members as they work out, noting that the moniker \"Vulture\" suits Toomes perfectly. Gwen worries that the next time he sics the Serpent Society on her they might go too far and kill her, and is scared that the self-loathing part of herself thinks they should. Determined to find a way to get the Vulture and his cronies to leave her alone, Gwen considers unleashing Venom on him - the shock collar not preventing her from using her powers, just making it painful to do so. As the symbiote hisses eagerly and starts to cover her, Gwen stops and scolds herself for relapsing into the same reckless behavior that got her thrown in prison to begin with. Noticing a security camera aimed at her, Gwen rants at it and demands to know why the people watching her are letting her get psychologically and physically tortured, lamenting that every time she tries to do the right thing it backfires. Calming down, Gwen glumly states that she did this to herself with her actions and choices, and that that's how she'll get out of prison. At mealtime, Gwen watching Toomes wisecrack with a group of corrupt guards and steal food from another inmate with impunity. Gwen notes that Toomes had been a genius but the indignity of not being noticed had driven him mad, but that in prison he was able to focus his intellect and climb to the top of the pecking order. Noting that she didn't become Spider-Woman to punch people in the face but to help others in need, Gwen spots Titania about to punch another inmate in the face and picks a fight with her, using her superhuman agility and reflexes to make a show of effortlessly dodging the larger woman's attacks. Effortlessly picking Titania up, Gwen cracks a joke and then lets Titania slam her into the floor hard enough to crater it. Indignantly storming off, Titania gives Gwen the finger and goes after her with a vengeance over the next several days, beating Gwen to a bloody pulp. At mealtime, Toomes sneers that Gwen might have entertained the other prisoners for a time, but her act lacks charm and pathos. As he leans in to threaten her, a guard tells him to back off and one of the other prisoners tells her to break a leg.\nSix months into her sentence, Gwen - who was gifted Cindy's cat poster - is visited by Captain America, who says that Gwen shouldn't be surprised that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been keeping a close eye on her. Gwen wryly retorts that she's not, Captain America saying thatDirector Carterfeels it's a waste for someone with Gwen's talents to rot in prison and wants to offer her a job. Gwen responds with sarcasm, asking Captain America what she thinks, and Captain America replies that her superiors think she can convince Gwen to willingly sign on but know that she won't let them forcibly conscript her. Captain America tells Gwen that S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking to put together a task force of inmates with uncommon combat abilities, and have already recruited Cindy Moon,Black Cat, the Punisher,Wolverine, and Shadowcat. Despite being offered her freedom and a license to operate as a superhero if she accepts, Gwen turns down the offer; saying that she doesn't want to be in prison but is because the system is broken and corrupt in a way only a person like her will see the benefits of. Gwen states that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s offer has made her see that unless she holds herself accountable for her misdeeds no-one will, and that she intends to serve her sentence in full. Gwen tells Captain America that most people who go to prison never get a second chance, and that when her sentence ends she can't just go rushing back out and do the same things that got her arrested in the first place. Lying alone in her cell, Gwen watches her father through the eyes of a Venom spider she left in his hospital room, and vows to do things right.\nTHE LIFE OF GWEN STACY Part 4\n• The secret identity of Earth-65’s Spider-Woman stands revealed…"

Mojo asks whoGwen Stacy's greatest arch-nemesis was, and the elderlyBodega Banditeagerly presses the buzzer and says it was himself. To his dismay, Mojo declares this to be false and that the Bodega Bandit was Gwen'sworstnemesis, askingSpider-Girlto give him the correct answer. Watching the game-show on a multiversal television and slouched in a lounge chair,Utau- theWatcherofEarth-65- lackadaisically predicts the answer is going to be \"Gwenom\" and lets out a sigh of boredom asSpider-Girlresponds that her mother's worst arch-nemesis was obviouslyVenom.\nRepresentatives of theCouncil of Watcherssuddenly appear and demand he explain himself, berating him for neglecting his sacred duty as a Watcher to observe the events of Earth-65 andonlyEarth-65. Utau protests that he paused the events of Earth-65 just before the Venom symbiote bonded to Spider-Gwen, and awkwardly explains he just needed a break; that Earth-8 - a possible future timeline of Earth-65 - turned out an idyllic utopia, but that events on Earth-65 have gotten excessively dark. As the head representative shouts that the events on Earth-65 are essential to the very fabric of its continued existence, Utau protests that it used to be fun watching the wacky adventures ofSpider-Gwen, but now everything's gotten all angsty and grim - lamenting the addition ofyet another Wolverineto the Multiverse. The Council of Watchers states that such critical judgements are beneath the lofty status of a Watcher, threatening to strip him of his job if he continues neglecting his duty. Lamenting having been suckered into the promise of \"an untapped universe of limitless potential\", Utau grumbles that there has to be something with human drama worth watching on Earth-65 to give everything relatable context and make it more real - skimming through various ongoing events like surfing channels until he comes across theEm Jay WatsonaskingGlory Grantif she remembers their gig the next day.\nAs Glory Grant assures her she'll be at the gig, Mary Jane Watson looks up to see a news report stating that Spider-Woman has been sighted inMadripoorand erupts into an angry tirade at Gwen neglecting band practice for superheroing. Glory mocks her theory about Gwen being Spider-Woman, but Em Jay suddenly has the brilliant idea of asking her to play drums. Glory retorts that if Em Jay is serious she's quitting, Em Jay retorting that she can't quit after just rejoining.Betty Brantinterrupts, telling Glory she thinks her drum skills are really good. Glory asks how long she's been there, and Betty sarcastically states it's been days before saying she agrees with Em Jay, adding that a gig is a gig and she needs the money. Glory reluctantly agrees, but says Em Jay can't be happy about it.\nOn the day of the gig, Glory expresses exasperation at Em Jay wondering if Gwen is a mutant, stating if that were the case Gwen would have gone tomutant school. Em Jay correctly guesses that Gwen was bitten by aradioactive spider, but Glory dismisses that as ridiculous because that's not how radioactivity or animal bites work. Em Jay chides Glory for being such a downer, Glory irritably asking Em Jay if it's not enough that she's there doing the drumming gig. The heel on Em Jay's shoe abruptly breaks, and as she starts to cry Glory says they can stick it back on with gum. As Glory browses the flavors, Em Jay spots her ex-boyfriend and yanks Glory back down. As Glory teases her, Em Jay's ex spots her peeking around the corner and calls out to her. She awkwardly approaches him and asks how he's been, and he tells her he's moving to Los Angeles; asking if she has the records he lent her. Having completely forgotten about them, Em Jay says she has a gig to get to and that she can give them to him there, but he refuses. As Glory watches the discussion with a wryly amused expression, Betty walks up with an armful of candy - to Glory's incredulity. Glory asks if Em Jay really thinks they're going back to their apartment just to get her ex's records, but Em Jay says the thing is that they're not at her apartment: she leant them toLiz Allen, who now hates her. Glory quickly fires off a text to Liz and says they're good to go, rolling her eyes at Em Jay's surprise and saying that not everything has to be an ordeal.\nThe three arrive at Liz's apartment - where a large party is ongoing - but she refuses to let Em Jay inside and glares at her instead. Glory sends Betty in to get the records, then asks Em Jay why Liz hates her. Em Jay said she and Liz had been good friends until Liz's boyfriend had started hitting on her. Em Jay had told Liz about his attempted infidelity, and Liz had abruptly stopped being her friend and started hating her. Glory facepalms at the self-absorbed way Em Jay had phrased this - making it sound like she'd been seducing him and rubbing it in Liz's face - and when Em Jay protests at being called self-absorbed Glory snaps that she literally named their band after herself.\nInside the party, Liz gives Betty the missing records, but on the way out she bumps into a boy. The boy starts flirting with Betty, who irritably states she's not interested; though he thinks she's just playing hard-to-get and fails to realize she's being sarcastic.\nOutside, Em Jay protests that Glory can't quit the band, Glory asking if all she is to Em Jay is a backup drummer for when Gwen flakes out and continuing to call Em Jay out on her selfishness; becoming further exasperated by her staunch belief that Gwen is Spider-Woman. Em Jay states that she hates that Gwen's not there, but they can cope without her because Glory's good at playing drums; and that if Glory were to quit it would just be her and Betty and sometimes Gwen, and she doesn't want anyone other than Glory to be their band's keyboardist and occasional backup drummer. Em Jay begs Glory to tell her what she has to do to make her stay, and Glory begrudging says she can start by letting people aside from herself exist and matter to her. Betty interrupts the argument, snapping that she took so long because an annoying boy was talking to her.\nAs they walk down the street, Glory wryly notes that she can't blame Em Jay for breaking up with her ex given his poor taste in music. The boy who'd spoken to Betty at the party runs after them, demanding to know why Betty wouldn't talk to him and angrily asking if she thinks she's too good for him. The boy demands to know if Betty has a boyfriend, but when she snaps thatshe doesthe boy insists that she must be lying. As the boy grabs Betty's phone to see if she has any photos, she yells at him to go away and Glory intercedes, snapping at the boy to back off. Em Jay kicks the boy in the back of the knee and punches him in the face hard enough to knock him out cold, retrieving Betty's phone as she and Glory stare in amazement. Betty asks if Em Jay is the superhero of the group, but she nonchalantly states she just took a self-defense course before cheerfully asking if they're ready to channel this adrenaline into a stellar performance. Em Jay admits her hand hurts really badly and wonders how Gwen manages to punch people for a living, Glory's admiration returning to exasperation.\nAt the concert, Em Jay introduces herself and the other band members before launching into a performance. After the show, Em Jay fires off a text to Gwen telling her to take care of herself and come home in one piece. The trio take the subway home, Betty snoozing using Glory's shoulder as a pillow. Em Jay congratulates them on an excellent performance, though Glory wryly states she's still quitting. Em Jay responds with gentle sarcasm that she believes her, and Glory flirtatiously adds that she's quitting no matter how many boys Em Jay punches out; Em Jay smiling back and responding that she'd punch out all the boys for Glory.\n“Predators” Part 5!\n• GWEN!

As theVenom symbiotesuddenly engulfs her, Gwen awakens from her nightmare and finds herself sitting in the reception area forher father's neurologistDr. Asim Strange- Captain George Stacy having come out of his coma while she was in prison. Doctor Strange starts to ask if she's Captain Stacy's daughter, but she assumes she's asking if he's \"Spider-Gwen\" - lamenting that she preferred Spider-Woman. Sitting across from her, Doctor Strange says that her father is just about ready to head home, though he advises her against letting Captain Stacy do anything strenuous for the time being. At the risk of sounding like a crystal-polishing quack, Doctor Strange states that he's worried about Captain Stacy's mental health and the state of his spirit, saying that he was on the brink of death and that such experiences incur trauma that he's likely to be in-denial about out of pride and stubbornness. Doctor Strange warns Gwen that his father trying to push himself too hard too fast in order to live up to the reputation of who he was before his coma will only put him back in the hospital and that their expectations of themselves must change. In his room, Captain Stacy gets dressed, then notices Gwen'sVenom spiderscrawling in his shoes.\nOutside the hospital, Gwen remarks that it's strange the hospital isn't swarming with paparazzi pestering them with questions of what they'll do next, her father joking they could star in a reality show calledThe Police Car-dashians. Gwen asks her father where he wants to go, and George suggests the Dollar Dog, indignantly challenging her to a race when she expresses concern regarding the distance and offers to web-swing him there.\nAs George leans against a statue to catch his breath, Gwen stands upside-down on an overhang and suggests they get a cab. George refuses and tells her to come down as people are staring, but Gwen says they'd stare anyway and that it's not a crime to take a walk. The two Stacies have an intense staredown before George asks her topleasecome down. They're forced to stop a few blocks later, entering a boutique to rest and get some water. As the clerk grouses that if George is going to die he may as well get something more than than bottled water, Gwen spots a selection of Spider-Gwen memorabilia and after a moment of incredulity decides to buy a hoodie patterned after her Spider-Woman costume.\nOutside, Gwen tells her father to slow down, but he irritably snaps that he's fine. Growing frustrated, Gwen demands to know what he's trying to prove. George rounds on her and asks what gives her the right to ask him that, telling her to look at herself. Gwen indignantly asks if he's really upset over a stupid sweatshirt, but he tells her what's upset him is that he's found her symbiote's spiders in his shoes and pockets; asking if she thinks he's a child who can't look after himself and snapping that it's not her job to protect him. Gwen grumbles an apology and that she and the symbiote are worried, George expressing concern givenits negative influence over her in the past. Gwen explains that the symbiote isn't evil anymore, but that it picks up on her emotions and just doesn't understand what to do with them. George asks if the reason why she quit being Spider-Woman is that she's afraid of losing control of it again. Gwen states that she gave the symbiote life and that the first things it learned were her rage and hatred; and that for as long as they're at peace it's her responsibility to show it that there's a better way. Sitting next to his daughter, George asks how their lives ended up so messed-up, wondering if he's at fault for having taught her to fight to protect those weaker than herself, for having chastised Spider-Woman for initially using her powers for personal gain. Asking how it's fair that she's suffered so much for his mistakes, George asks what she could have possibly done to deserve the misery life's heaped upon her. Quoting an old Western movie, Gwen states that she and her father aren't the heroes they thought they were, but that all they can do is keep moving forward and striving to one day live up to that ideal. George asks Gwen how that's possible, saying that even after she served her time in prison people are still waiting for an excuse to label her a menace and lock her away for good or conscript her into being a S.H.I.E.L.D. supersoldier. Gwen states that she was certain that everyone hated Spider-Woman, but that her hoodie is proof that there are still people who believe in her. George states that no matter how hard Gwen tries to do better and avoid fighting, she knows better than anyone that sooner or later someone will seek her out and give her no other choice. Gwen states that if that happens that someone might just get what they were looking for, but until then she has to at least know she tried her best to solve problems without resorting to violence. George relents, and when Gwen asks if he's trying some wily old cop trick on her he states that he nearly died but that some higher power decided to give them more time together, and that he's not about to squander that being a hypocrite. Smiling, George tells his daughter that he has her back so long as she agrees to keep her spiders out of his shoes. Joking that he must have gone insane from hunger, George tells Gwen to show him the city from her perspective.\nWeb-swinging to the Dollar Dog, Gwen asks her dad what it was like being in a coma. George states that it was like lucid dreaming, giving Gwen a few humorous examples. Gwen remarks that she doesn't remember her dreams anymore, George replying that it'd be hard to top waking up with spider-powers. Eating a bacon-wrapped corn dog, Gwen remarks that really freaked her out, and she was initially terrified her powers would suddenly stop working and she'd fall to her death. Stating that there's no normal in her life anymore, Gwen remarks that she's finally okay with that but wonders what it means for the rest of her life.\nIn a flashback to an earlier meeting with her friends,Betty Brantanswers Gwen's question with an enthusiastic reply that it means the Mary Janes are going on a world tour. Gwen expresses incredulity, butGlory Grantremarks that for once Betty is making a modicum of sense. Glory elaborates that the band could go on tour and Gwen could use this as an excuse to help people outside of New York City, hiding in plain sight and helping people like a friendlyghost. Gwen shuts the idea down, stating that it reminds her of Murdock's ninja and that if she wanted to hide she'd never have taken off her mask.Em Jayasks if this is a no to going on tour, and Gwen replies that she's unsure and wants to keep things local at first. Taking Em Jay's hand, Glory says that coming from Gwen a \"maybe\" is a promise set in stone; but Betty - who had been ignoring the conversation and focused on texting - declares that she's secured her cousin's Winnebago and that they're going on tour whether they like it or not.\nSnapped back to the present by the sound of sirens, Gwen tenses and is told by George that they're fire trucks instead of police. As Gwen lets out a disappointed sigh, George tells his daughter that he loves her. They hug and Gwen rushes out the door, passing theBodega BanditandMr. Albie, who wish her luck and tell her not to be late for her shift. Watching his daughter web-swing away, George glances at a Venom spider perched on his hand and quips to it that his daughter always wanted a dog.\nAt a burning apartment, the firefighters are ordered to pull out and evacuate the area. A firefighter on the roof states that he can't comply, struggling to haul an injured comrade named Valdez onto the roof. The cable securing Valdez breaks, the firefighter devastated by the loss of his friend only for a hooded figure to land in front of him holding Valdez' unconscious body. The firefighter nervously asks who the figure is, Gwen Stacy throwing back her hood and introducing herself as Spider-Gwen.\nTHE TRIAL OF SPIDER-WOMAN CONCLUDES!\n• For months, Gwen Stacy has been fighting the world as Spider-Woman…"

Jonah Jamesondeliver a televised \"Spider-Woman is a menace!\" rant. George angrily shuts the television off in disgust, irritated that the mayor makes it sound like the police aren't trying their best. As Gwen expresses bemusement, her father grouses that it won't be a mayoral task force who brings the no-good vigilante Spider-Woman to justice but good old-fashioned police legwork. Gwen chuckles and asks if he means spider legs, and as her father raises an eyebrow at her bad joke she excuses herself.\nIn the present, Gwen watches a video of Mayor Jameson issue a press release welcoming Spider-Woman back to the city after her prison sentence ended and lauding her as a symbol of strength and integrity. Gwen shuts the video off in disgust, dismissing Jameson as a wolf who follows the strong and preys on the weak, and asksher symbioteif it can copy her blue hoodie, which now has a hole in the sleeve. As the symbiote shapeshifts, Gwen happily thanks it and thinks to herself that being a hero has had its ups and downs but never having to do laundry again is a definite bonus. Going downstairs, she greets George and calls him the best father in the world. George snarks that he's still not getting her a dog, and when she wonders when she asked him for one he says she was nine and that he has a long memory. Gwen remarks that she wants to have a spider-pony that can help her fight crime, and expresses confusion when George remarks she just describedSleipnir, lamenting his poor uncultured daughter. As Gwen helps herself to his toast and asks if he's going back to work, he jokingly scolds her to get her own breakfast or he'll arrest her for toast theft. George wonders why she's buttering him up, and Gwen tells him that she found a woman's purse the other day. George wryly asks if she wants a cookie on top of his stolen toast, but Gwen adds that she was paid for it. George doesn't see anything unusual, and Gwen elaborates that heroes don't usually get paid for saving the day, like police officers don't get paid for solving crimes. George corrects her, saying that the policedoget paid through tax dollars, and asks where Gwen's going with this. Gwen says that with her high-school diploma and prison record it's going to be impossible to get a regular job, but if she's paid for odd jobs she can both help people as Spider-Womanandpay the rent, asking if he's okay with this. George remarks that he's honestly not, adding that he can't ask her to stop being Spider-Woman but that he doesn't have to be happy about it. Gwen tells him it's too late to put the genie back in the bottle, and that by doing this she can show the people of New York that she's not a monster to be afraid of. George notes she's not asking for permission, asking that she be careful.\nAs Spider-Woman swings over the city, she huffs that she'salwayscareful. Spotting theBodega Banditrobbing a store clerk at gunpoint, she scolds him, saying she thought they talked about this when she gave himher pet hamster. Spider-Woman tells the Bodega Bandit to put the gun down, apologize to the store clerk, and walk away; but the Bandit -- still holding the clerk at gunpoint -- casually asks how she's been and if she wants to be called Spider-Woman or Gwen. Spider-Woman insists that he call her by her hero alias when she's in-costume, the clerk incredulously asking if they know each other. As the Bodega Bandit proudly declares himself her arch-nemesis, Spider-Woman web-yanks his gun away and says that he's not. As he dejectedly asks if he can at least have the sunflower seeds he was trying to steal, Spider-Woman tells him no and to leave. As the Bandit rushes out the door, Spider-Woman informs the clerk that the gun was fake before suddenly being overcome by a migraine. As she clutches her head, the clerk asks if she's alright. Gwen assures him she's fine and web-swings away, hopingBetty Branthas aspirin.\nAt her apartment, Betty sits on her couch next toMurderface, her cat; checking her laptop. As Murderface turns and meows at something outside, Betty turns and is shocked to see Spider-Woman dangling upside-down outside her window. Opening her window, Betty asks what Gwen is doing; and when Gwen states she's has a nasty headache and is hungry Betty wryly asks if her father feeds her. As Gwen helps herself to donuts and outlines her plan to be a hero for hire, Betty asks how she plans to deal with stuff like filing taxes and laments Gwen's utter lack of business acumen. Betty warns her that running a small business is more complicated than it sounds on the surface, but Gwen insists, stating she has no other way to make a living. Betty quickly whips up a website, Gwen giving her a thank-you hug and dislodging Murderface from her lap in the process.\nMeeting with theMary Janes, Gwen finds thatMary Jane Watsondoes not share her enthusiasm and berates her for not focusing on the band. Gwen states that she needs to pay her share of the rent, and Em Jay irately suggests she just move back in with Betty. Betty immediately vetoes that, saying the last thing she wants is a super-villain smashing through her bedroom window. Exasperated, Gwen asks if they can just start rehearsing, Em Jay grumping that that's her line. After practice, Betty apologizes and says she didn't mean to insult Gwen, who says that she understands perfectly as living with a hero is dangerous. As the band members depart, Gwen walks up a wall and transforms her symbiote from civilian clothes into her Spider-Woman costume, not noticing a couple of symbiote-spiders fall off as she web-swings away.\nPerching on a street lamp, Spider-Woman checks her site and is disgusted that the only message is from someone looking to hook up with her. Deleting it, she sets up some fliers and laments how difficult running a business is compared to simple things like fighting crime. Hearing a scream coming from an abandoned parking lot, Spider-Woman drops down and finds an old cassette player. As she examines it in confusion, a pipe strikes across the back of the head, knocking her to the ground. Several thugs come out of hiding, their leader -- the man with the pipe -- saying she made a big mistake walking into their trap. Spider-Woman evades his follow-up attack and scolds him for sinking so low as to set traps, using her spider-sense to take out his thugs. As Gwen prepares to punch him out, asking if this was supposed to be some kind of gang initiation ritual, the leader smirks and states there's a bad moon rising. Spider-Woman is confused, only to be blinded by a flash of bright light. As her vision clears, she finds herself standing on a rooftop overlooking the parking lot, her head throbbing in pain. Expressing confusion as to how she got up to the rooftop and why her head's hurting more than anything since she was bitten by the radioactive spider, Gwen laments that the criminals got away. Realizing she's in too much pain to safely web-swing home, Spider-Woman callsHarry Osbornfor a ride home.\nAt the gang's hideout, a bespectacled and mustached man calling himself theJackalsits at his laptop and congratulates the thugs on getting him what he needed. As they complain that Spider-Woman did a number on them, the Jackal shows them no sympathy and says he's doing his part. The gang's leader,a hulking werewolfin a leather jacket with metal-plated shoulders, sneers that jackals are scavengers and little better than prey. Disgruntled by the threat, the Jackal retorts that he knows how they can beat Spider-Woman, stating that she has no combat technique whatsoever and counts on taking her opponents out with brute force. Jackal states that she's also taking on clients, the Man-Wolf mockingly asking if he's thinking of hiring her. Jackal retorts that they know that she's Captain Stacy's daughter but attacking her at home would bring the entire NYPD down on them, less to protect her and more to protect her father. When the Jackal states that Spider-Woman will stretch herself thin and sooner or later leave herself vulnerable, Man-Wolf is amused and tells him to keep an eye on her and even throw her some work, giving her some time to set herself up to fail.\nArriving at her father's house, Gwen thanks Harry for the ride home. He asks if she's OK, and she assures him it was just a headache. He invites her out on a dinner-date to a fancy restaurant, and she accepts, saying that would be nice. Inwardly thinking that she could get used to doing more normal things, Gwen heads inside, not noticing the pieces of her symbiote she's leaving behind her.\n• After the life-changing events of SPIDER-GEDDON, Gwen Stacy of Earth-65 has resolved to stay on her home turf and resume her normally scheduled super-heroics as GHOST-SPIDER.\n• But in the wake of the Hand’s downfall, SOMETHING sinister has begun stalking the streets of New York at night."

Noticing theBodega Banditrobbing the store of ice cream sandwiches, she follows him and transforms into Venom. Noting that all her appetites are out of control, Venom pounces on him from behind as he celebrates his successful robbery. As he cowers before her, Venom coldly dismisses him as ridiculous and pathetic, calling him everything that's wrong with the world and stating that she's tired and bored of this obnoxious game. Pleading for mercy, the Bodega Bandit confesses he never wanted to be a criminal living on the streets, but that he became addicted to the thrill after his first robbery and can't stop himself anymore. Spotting a missing poster set up by the Mary Janes, Venom departs, leaving the Bandit confused and terrified.\nThe next morningDetective Jean DeWolffandOfficer Fletcher Boylespeak to Marvin, the owner of Grocery Etc, about what had happened. When Marvin states he's afraid that Spider-Woman will attack him, DeWolff assures him that Spider-Woman is confused, angry, and in pain due to someone close to her having been badly injured. Marvin asks if that person is George Stacy, and when Boyle tries to deflect, DeWolff interrupts and confirms it. Marvin tells DeWolff that after George Stacy was brutally beaten while under police protection he has no confidence in their ability to handle Spider-Woman. Leaving the store, Boyle apologizes to DeWolff, saying that he thought they'd finally gotten a lead on Spider-Woman; and she notes that the fact that Spider-Woman hadn't turned the Bodega Bandit in concerns her more than Frank Castle having gone rogue and starting a war with the Kingpin. Spotting the missing person poster for Gwen, she takes down the number and tells Boyle they're going to call the Mary Janes.\nAt the playground, Gwen solicitsReed Richards' help in breaking intoS.H.I.E.L.D.'s maximum-security prison. Reed notes that he can easily bypass S.H.I.E.L.D.'s encryption and findCindy Moon's cell, but observes that Gwen's new look and behavior strike him as borderline diabolical. Gwen acknowledges that he's right but promises not to hurt Cindy, saying she needs the S.I.L.K. leader's help. Reed warns Gwen that Cindy won't help her for free and that she can't owe a person like her, but Gwen replies that everything started with the spider Cindy made and released into the wild, and that if anything Cindy owes her. Infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D.'s prison using Reed's portal device, Venom notices a couple of guards gossiping and decides to borrow one ofMiles Morales' tricks: turning invisible. Sneaking up behind the guards, she knocks them out and then opens the door to Cindy's cell, finding her meditating. Without turning around or opening her eyes, Cindy mocks Gwen's attempt at stealth and how cliched donning black to reflect her angst is.\nTelling her to get in and close the door, Cindy asks Gwen what it is she thinks she wants, but Venom angrily grabs her by the throat and then throws her to the floor, demanding to know why Cindy ruined her life. Cindy notes she'd expected Gwen to ask her \"how\" — how to defeatMatt Murdock, how to control the symbiote — and then tells Gwen she wasted half her life trying to recapture a moment that had passed her by: replicating theradioactive spiderthat would have given her powers had it not been killed; but when she finally succeeded, she'd been terrified of the prospect of failure. Rather than use it on herself to gain the power she'd desired, Cindy had set it loose into the world where it had bitten Gwen. Furious at Cindy's flippant answer, Venom slams her into a wall, but Cindy reiterates that she'd been afraid not only that the spider would have failed to grant her powers, but that it would have succeeded. Telling Gwen that the rage and fear and doubt driving her to violence aren't the work of the symbiote but her own emotions, Cindy challenges her to let go of her hatred towards Murdock; then returns to meditating as additional guards arrive and break down the door of her cell. As Venom attacks them, she assures Gwen that she can overcome her fear and hatred if she tries, then asks if Gwen has the courage to do so.\nAt Betty's apartment, Em Jay outlines her plans for the group to hand out fliers across all of Manhattan. When Glory urges her to calm down and rest, Em Jay snaps that she has no intention of doing so and that Gwen needs their help. Glory states that if Gwen is Spider-Woman that means she's been on her own for longer than they realized; and as sad as it is that they weren't able to support her sooner, they can't make up for it in one day. Betty sends a text toFalconasking for his help just as there is a knock at their door. Glory opens it to see May and Ben Parker holding one of their fliers.\nAs Venom prowls a cell-block of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s prison complex, she spots a cell door labelled \"Hardy, Felicia\". Peering inside to see the former Black Cat lying on a cot and wearing an orange jumpsuit, Gwen retracts the symbiote  from her face and asks why she's locked up in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison. Reed opens a portal and tells Gwen to hurry up, so she offers to bust Felicia out. Felicia refuses and glumly remarks that Murdock has won, that everyone and everything not already under his control soon will be, and that this is the price she paid for failing to kill him.\nOnboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Falcon throws a tantrum over not being allowed to participate in Spider-Woman and the Kingpin's grudge match. Dismissing Spider-Woman as a distraction,Director Peggy CarterhasAgent Clay Quartermainread a list of global-scale threats -- including a eugenics war on Mt. Wundagore and a plague of Thor frogs in the Gulf of Mexico -- for him to tackle instead. Director Carter tries to bribe Falcon into compliance, so he relents and sends a text message toCaptain Americaasking her to find Gwen. Standing in the S.H.I.E.L.D. prison looking over the unconscious agents left in Venom's wake, Captain America replies that she's already on the case.\nGWENOM Part 2\n• S.H.I.E.L.D. is coming for Gwen and the Venom symbiote, and giving into its power may be Gwen’s only way out!"

Utau wakes up and asks if Utaa is going to report him to theCouncil, but his colleague says he won't and respects the sacred oath to only observe and never interfere. Dumping his squirrel pie wrappers in a garbage can, Utau complains about how depressing things have gotten on Earth-65; and when Utaa sneers at this Utau reminds him that his \"snooty future utopia\" is a possible future of Earth-65 and could be put in jeopardy if things get too dark. Sitting in Utau's chair, Utaa tells his colleague that like it or not he's there to support him, noting that the timelines of the multiverse operate on a paradoxical combination of the Many Worlds and Stable Timeline theorems - each event in a timeline making a chaotically infinite number of alternate timelines possible, yet ordered by a strict continuity. Utaa notes that certain events recur across multiple timelines, and that as time recycles the older and stronger timelines become resilient to alterations and disruptions to status quos, with changes being infinitesimal at best. Utau tells Utaa to get to the point, and Utaa remarks that thus far Earth-65 has been steadily leading towards Earth-8 but that the Council is concerned about Utau's vigilance - or lack thereof - and then incredulously asks Utau if he just sawUncle BentellGwen Stacyto murderMatt Murdock. Utau nonchalantly confirms this, causing Utaa to panic at the damage these developments could inflict on the time-space continuum. As Utaa demands Utau do something to rectify what's gone wrong, Utau smugly reiterates Utaa's statement that like it or not as Watchers they are only supposed to observe and not interfere.\nOn Earth-65,Frank Castlelimps down a hallway, leaving dead Hand ninja in his wake despite having been injured. Matt Murdock stands on the roof overlooking the city and examining the portal watch.Otomoarrives and says that the last of their ninja have been killed, volunteering to delay Castle while Murdock makes his escape. Murdock decides to deal with Castle himself, and Otomo tries to stop him from exposing himself as the Kingpin and ruining the Hand's work in New York. The door to the roof explodes as Castle arrives, Murdock smugly boasting that he is the puppet master and he alone decides when to cut the strings. As Castle attempts to blast Murdock with his War Machine gauntlet, Venom arrives, grabs Murdock - surprising Utaa and Utau - and snarls that she wants to be the one to kill him and is not going to let him get off so easily. Murdock draws his katana and cuts the web-line she used to secure him, dropping back down to the roof and saying that an easy death is the last thing he wants. He leaps over Castle's gauntlet blast before snarking that Castle should have looked into getting a fitbit given his labored breathing. Venom stops Castle from blasting Murdock and berates him for slaughtering the Hand ninja, stating the only one who should die is the Kingpin; Murdock chuckling that they're the worst team-up ever as Castle snaps at Venom's hypocrisy. Castle blasts Venom with his gauntlet, butCaptain Americaarrives at the last second - Utau telling the incredulous Utaa to calm down and enjoy the show - and deflects the energy beam with her shield; telling Castle to stand down. When he attacks her again, Captain America punches him out and turns to confront Venom and the Kingpin. Murdock affects a fake Southern accent and mockingly thanks her for saving him, but she kicks him in the face and tells him to shut up. As Venom incredulously asks what she is doing here, Captain America tells her to breathe and listen to her voice, gently apologizing to Gwen for taking so long to arrive but assuring her that she's there to help.\nGwen retracts the symbiote from her face as Captain America reaches out towards her, stating that Samantha can't fix anything since she doesn't know what Murdock's done. Captain America states she knows all about what Murdock has done and promises Gwen that he'll see justice. Enraged, Gwen transforms back into Venom and furiously punches Samantha, snarling that Murdock will never see justice because he owns both sides of the law; stomping on her shield before she can reclaim it. Captain America tells Gwen to stand down and that the symbiote is making her sick; but the Venom attacks her instead, using the symbiote's tongue to break Samantha's arm before knocking her out, stating that she has to kill Murdock. Murdock quips that he's proud of Gwen punching the American flag in the face, but Venom grabs him by the throat and tells him to shut up and die. As she prepares to drop him off the edge of the building, Murdock states that he's succeeded in showing her what true power is and can die happy knowing he's not alone. Realizing that this is what he wants, Venom angrily tosses him aside and snaps that she won't be like him, and Murdock incredulously asks if she truly didn't enjoy indulging her rage and hatred by fighting him. Thedimensional portal watchactivates, opening a portal under Venom. As Gwen disappears from the time-space continuum, Utaa and Utau incredulously try to figure out what's going on; Utau speculating that the portal watch somehow has a mind of its own based on its actions during theMiles Moralesteam-up, and Utaa complaining they're just adding fuel to the temporal dumpster fire withanothercrossover as Venom regains consciousness in front ofan alternate Gwen Stacy.\nGWENOM PART 5\n• Gwen Stacy has let herself get lost in the Venom, and it’s turning her against her allies — including Captain America!"

Arriving as Spider-Woman, Gwen apologizes for being late and transformsher symbioteinto a white hoodie and black jeans. Harry asks if she thinks her chronic migraines are connected with her powers, and Gwen states that they have to be since she hasn't gotten sick since she first obtained them. Harry wryly comments on her lack of food poisoning or weight gain despite her diet primarily consisting of corndogs, Gwen swatting him for the remark before saying she thinks something is wrong with her symbiote. Noting that it's alive, Harry asks if she can't just ask it if something is wrong, but Gwen states that it's more complex than that and that the only person who can help her figure out what's wrong with it is its creator,Dr. Elsa Brock; however,Oscorphas no records of having employed a Dr. Elsa Brock, confusing and infuriating Harry.\nGwen obtains a guest badge from the receptionist and she and Harry check out Dr. Brock's office only to find it empty. Gwen laments that with Dr. Brock gone andCindy MoonandMatt Murdock-- the other individuals with knowledge of her symbiote -- imprisoned, she has no-one to turn to. Harry volunteers to help her, though when she bitterly asks him how he can do so, he is insulted, stating that there's no point in bothering if he doesn't have powers of his own anymore. Gwen tells Harry that he and theMary Janesare the only people who still treat her as Gwen Stacy rather than Spider-Woman, thanking him for helping keep her grounded and sane. When Harry asks what they can do, Gwen says they'll just have to sleuth it.\nAt band practice, Gwen tries to look up Elsa Brock on Zoogle, but is interrupted by an irateMJ Watson, who demands she devote every ounce of her being to the band's comeback. Enduring MJ berating her drill sergeant-style, Gwen walks over to her drum kit,Glory Grantwhispering that MJ is just anxious. Gwen tries to keep the beat despite the loud music aggravating her headache, but the song is interrupted by MJ noticing one of Gwen's Venom spiders on her and freaking out. As MJ rounds on Gwen and accuses her of trying to usurp control of the band, Glory intercedes to calm her girlfriend down and tells Gwen to take her leave. Watching Gwen web-swing away, MJ expresses jealousy of her powers, Glory telling her she's heard her complaints before.\nEating a corndog and feeling it soothe her headache, Gwen wonders if MJ's bad temper couldn't be solved by an increase in calories. Transforming into Spider-Woman, she sets off in search of criminals to beat up, coming across a group of thugs robbing a store. As one of the thugs attacks her, Spider-Woman partially Venomizes - her hood becoming jagged, her mask turning black, and her voice distorting as she snarls that it's her turn. The criminals beg for mercy, but she furiously lays into them, chasing them down when they attempt to flee. Leaving them bruised and broken, Spider-Woman web-swings away wondering why her life has to be so hard.\nLater on, one of the thugs complains to theJackalabout how brutal Spider-Woman was, calling her a monster. Miles Warren snaps at him to be quiet and hold still while he sutures his cuts, lamenting that he didn't pursue a career in academia before spotting a Venom spider clinging to the thug. Capturing it, the Jackal brings it toMan-Wolf, ignoring his threats and explaining that it's connected to Spider-Woman and her powers, thus giving them a way to defeat her. Man-Wolf orders Jackal to do the job, telling him to prove himself a predator by killing Spider-Woman.\nWeb-swinging over the city, Spider-Woman berates herself for going too far when thrashing the thugs, pulling off her mask only to have it crumble into Venom spiders and sobbing into her hands. Arriving at the Mary Janes concert on-time for once, Gwen transforms her symbiote into a black t-shirt with a large white spider-emblem; however, as the concert begins, Gwen's spider-sense goes off and she spots a bomb planted in the theater's trusses. Transforming into Spider-Woman, she shoves MJ out of the way and covers the band in webbing before leaping up and cocooning the bomb in an attempt to disarm it. Noticing countless other bombs, she spots Harry in the audience and leaps down to warn him... but is too late, the bombs detonating and bringing the theater crashing down on everyone in the audience.\n• Making a dent in the criminal underworld has painted a target on Spider-Woman’s back — and with her secret identity revealed, Gwen Stacy will find the people she cares about most in the crosshairs!"

He starts to backslide into his former nihilism, but corrects himself, lamenting that his guilty conscience is causing him such pain. When Alice wakes up and starts screaming for help, Carnage reassures her and explains that he wants to be a superhero. Alice agrees to help him if he promises not to hurt her, explaining to a confused Carnage that good people, especially heroes, keep their promises. Carnage fantasizes about killing her, but agrees and makes the promise.\nElsewhere, Gloria, a social worker, comes home and tells her husband thatEmil Greggmissed out on their appointment again. The next morning she and her husband go to a shantytown to look for him, and she mentions that when she last saw him he'd developed the delusion that he actually was the Sin-Eater. Directed to a tent, they find Emil's necrotic corpse clutching a green balaclava and being eaten by rats and maggots.\nAt a cemetery, Alice tells Carnage that in order to redeem himself the first step is to confess his sins. Spotting an observer and believing him to be a grave robber, Carnage attacks, knocking him into an open grave, but Alice stops him, stating that the man is a gravedigger and ordering him to apologize. Once Carnage does so, Alice takes out her smartphone and films his confession, stating she'll post it on the internet for the world to see that he is repentant. Instead, she sends it to her boss, Frank, in order to get Chris Rollins' spot. Frank alerts the police that she was kidnapped by Carnage, but the SWAT teams dispatched only find the gravedigger.\nComing across a bank robbery, Alice instructs Carnage to intervene but berates him when he sets the bank on fire to prevent future robberies. The Sin-Eater arrives at the CVN broadcast station and holds Frank at gunpoint looking for Alice, and he points to the TV, where Carnage is putting out the fire. As Alice and Carnage set out to look for a new crime to thwart, they are attacked by a police helicopter, which gets Carnage's tendrils tangled in its rotors. The copter crashes, causing Carnage to drop Alice, but just as he catches her the Sin-Eater arrives, severing his tendrils and taking her hostage. As the Sin-Eater drives away with Alice, Carnage vows to rescue her just as a pair of F-15's fire their missiles at him.\n• Carnage has kidnapped one of New York City’s most beloved news anchors -- BUT WHY?\n• What is the Sin Eater after? And what does it have to do with Carnage?"

Coming across a woman being accosted by a thug, Cletus fantasizes about bisecting her before scolding himself. Punching the thug hard enough to pop one of his eyes out, Carnage is attacked by a second thug and cuts off his arm. Paralyzed by his new conscience when he realizes he went too far, Carnage is attacked by the woman, who he realizes is a prostitute. He knocks the woman out with a light punch, congratulating himself for not killing her, but is yelled at by onlookers for hitting a woman.\nAt a massage parlour/brothel, Chris Rollins, a reporter, is approached by the Sin-Eater. When Rollins asks if he isa cop, the Sin-Eater remarks that the impostor is dead and takes aim. Rollins grabs the Sin-Eater's shotgun, knocking over a candle that sets the parlour on fire. In the struggle, he rips off the Sin-Eater's mask to reveal a glowing green skull, and the Sin Eater takes advantage of his shock to shoot him.\nAt the CVN news station, reporter Alice Gleason, Chris' coworker and lover, delivers a heartfelt eulogy. Carnage, observing the broadcast on TV, deduces that she is a good person and decides to ask her for advice on how to be a superhero, but once the cameras stop rolling she reveals herself to be a cold and ambitious woman who had been sleeping with Rollins to further her career. Her boss, Frank, issues her police protection, which she rejects and demands to take Rollins' place reporting on superheroes. Her boss initially refuses, but when she insists tells her to bring him something to prove her worth.\nAt Alice's apartment, she seduces the police officer sent to protect her. While she's making coffee, he spots someone hiding behind her curtain and opens fire. The intruder, revealed to be the Sin-Eater, is unaffected by the bullet and returns fire, killing the officer. He devours the green spectres that emerge from the officer's corpse just as Alice walks in. As he takes aim at her, rebuking her protests of being a good person, Carnage crashes through the window and shoots him in the head with his own shotgun. Alice faints and Carnage takes her, not noticing the Sin-Eater's head regenerating. Alice regains consciousness webbed to the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge, and when she sees Carnage inches from her face screams over his request for her tutelage.\nAXIS TIE-IN!\n• Carnage is back in NYC and the city will never look at him the same way again!"

Atalanta refuses to let him in. However, Doom appears before The Pantheon via his Time Platform. Atalanta  reluctantly concedes to hear what Doom is offering to them. Discussing over tea, Doom explains to The Pantheon that he is not from their time period and he had traveled to their era through the Time Platform, and he is interested in ruling the post-apocalyptic world. But he sees the Maestro to be a threat to his plans and as well to everyone, and he wanted to form an alliance with The Pantheon to neutralize the tyrannical Hulk. The Pantheon agrees with his offer, and forms a plan to defeat the Maestro by restoring him to his human form.\nSometime after the Maestro returned from his failed mission against Machine Man, the Maestro is rebuilding his Dogs of War at the Alchemax Building until he is approached by The Minister, who informs him about a group of strange visitors who called themselves The Pantheon. Maestro is surprised to hear their names, and still recognizing them as friends. The Pantheon waits for Maestro in his throne room until their former ally makes his entrance through the skylight. The Pantheon's dimwitted member Ajax immediately attacks the Hulk, mistaking that he is about to attack them. Fortunately their brief brawl is ceased when Maestro and Atalanta calms down Ajax. The Maestro reacquaints with The Pantheon and invites them for lunch.\nThe Pantheon and Maestro have a friendly discussion about the latter's PAX movement in which The Pantheon voice their agreement with its goals and are willing to join the Maestro. Atalanta then points out that not many are willing to embrace PAX, as she claims that A.I.M. is among those who will pose a threat to the Maestro. The Maestro is unconcerned about them, as they had failed twice to stop him from leaving their bunker in Los Angeles. But Atalanta insists that A.I.M. must be neutralized, not just for being a threat to PAX but for personal reasons; she allegedly claims that A.I.M. was responsible for killing Prometheus. Maestro understands the need for vengeance and agrees to lead them to A.I.M.'s headquarters.\nThe Pantheon takes Maestro on board their aircraft and make their way to Los Angeles. But on the way, the Maestro curiously ask of how Prometheus died. Atalanta states that she doesn't like to talk about it, but Ajax ignorantly blurts out that Prometheus died from a sickness and that no one actually killed him. Atalanta frantically tries to cover up the ruse saying that Ajax isn't remembering correctly. Unfortunately the Maestro is not fooled. He grabs Atalanta by the throat and demands The Pantheon on what is going on. A stand off ensues between Maestro and Hector and Ulysses until the Maestro suddenly becomes disoriented and drops Atalanta. Ulysses explains to Maestro that he had been breathing high-powered knockout gas (potent enough to take out a pod of blue whales) provided by Doctor Doom that had been filling the entire cabin while The Pantheon were wearing nose filters thus making them immune. The Maestro finally goes unconscious.\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nYears ago, a dying Prometheus is hospitalized in The Pantheon's medical facilities while being looked after by a very distraught Delphi and Ulysses. Prometheus, under his dying breath, lash out at Delphi for the cause of his death: Delphi had envisioned the Black Scythe terrorist group's attack on Philadelphia, and she had tasked Prometheus to stop them. However, Delphi had failed to foreseen the Black Scythe unleashing toxic gas that would affect and kill millions along with Prometheus.\nShortly after Prometheus's death, Atalanta orders Ulysses and Delphi to gather in the situation room along with the others to make their plans to avenge Prometheus by completely destroying the Black Scythe. The Pantheon may have failed to stop the world from blowing itself up and stop the Black Scythe from killing millions more, they are ending this no matter what.\nDEUS IN DEUS!"

From her gathered intel,Chasm (Ben Reilly)has caused events in the city along with aredheadedaccomplice, which reminds Felicia to seek outMary Janeafter immolating several newspaper demons hounding her. Although not a choice, Felicia does so forPeter's sake; and because she never really learns from her past experiences, she cares about what he needs all over again. Recalling their last adventure,[1]Felicia likes Mary Jane and they're good friends now, but Felicia was content with Peter being with Mary Jane, yet the roles are reversed. Felicia still aims to help Mary Jane because Peter would want her safe as she doesn't have super powers, only to find Mary Janewith super powersprotectingPauland his kids from demonic appliances from her sisterGayle. Once finished, Mary Jane is startled by Black Cat's arrival and orders that she saw nothing, while Black Cat did see something and is curious if Mary Jane held back when they went against Tombstone.[1]\nHowever, a demonic water tank grabs Mary Jane with water tendrils, so Felicia orders Paul to take the kids to the basement for safety as she'll save Mary Jane. CallingIron Manto send security drones, he capitulates when Felicia elaborates on Mary Jane's involvement before he hangs up. As the water tower demon climbs a building, Mary Jane calms down to activate her device tospinfor a new power. Reaching out to grab some form of energy, shepullsit and earns three slot icons: Horse Shoe, Seven, and Bell. With flame wings and a fire sword to fight the demon, Felicia arrives and inquires if Mary Jane is anAvengeror aMutant, the latter being a hot topic now. Mary Jane refuses to discuss this any further but asks if Felicia won't simply accept that it's her business, and Felicia reminds her about cats and curiosity. With the water tower demon defeated, Felicia informs Mary Jane that Tony had sent a drone to check up on Paul and the kids. Felicia also tells her that Ben Reilly is back and the cause of the demonic disturbance like what happenedyears earlier, so a concerned Mary Jane asks her for a lift back to her family.\nWhen asking who knows, Mary Jane admits that Paul knows but not Peter, wishing to keep it so, trusting Felicia can keep the secret. Feeling guilty since she's dating Peter now, Felicia fails to change the subject as Mary Jane asks about Peter's well-being. Felicia mentions his tussle withTombstone,[2]but is distracted when a portal toLimboopens, blaming herself for forgetting to consider that the channeled magic could flow both ways. Upon landing, they are met by native demons, perplexed by moreEarthgirls showing up in their domain. Not wanting to stay any longer than they want, Mary Jane spins for a new power and gets Cherry, Skull, and BAR. With a bad spin, Mary Jane becomes a pudding person, elaborating that her wristband works like slots with a new power per activation. When reminded of the demons staring them down, the two women fight said demons, not attentive to the man aside from the skirmish calling their attention. Blasting away the demons, the man has their attention and elaborates that it was he who \"invited\" them to Limbo while the borders of reality were so porous. Because while a pudding woman was a bonus,Belasconeeded a thief for a matter and Belasco gets whatever Belasco requires.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nEvents:\nRecounting her theft ofDoctor Doom's mask,Black Catescaped by using hisTime Platform.

However,Professor Xenters their minds and has them calmly leap from the window, killing them all. Back on Krakoa, Xavier feels bad for having to resort to killing them, whileEmma Frostchides him for being soft.\nLater, Emma summons theQuiet Council of SinistersatHope’srequest. Hope lays out the larger galactic scenario as she sees it, with Earth likely being conquered within 17 years. Her opinion is that they “need bigger guns” to deal with the threats coming over the horizon. The Council convenes to think about it, while Emma notes that Sinister wasn’t into the idea when it was first brought up[1].\nMister Sinisterheads to his Westchester Complex where a Sinister clone awaits. Sinister created the clone to talk through the current problem and hope the discussion prompts new ideas. He recounts the problem - his lab has been stolen and the Quiet Council of Sinisters is disagreeing with him. His power is split with the rest of the Council and if they knew about the existence of the Moira lab, they would want it for themselves. Sinister reveals that he has a psychic inferno installed as a fail-safe which could kill all his Sinisters, but wonders if it’s worth it to go that route. The clone asks him if he’s worried about someone else triggering the fail safe and he says yes, that’s why he kept it in the safest place he could think of - in the secret Moira lab! His next option is to regain control of the Council by physically inserting a gene update in the members. Satisfied, Sinister triggers the clone to self-destruct, as Sinister doesn’t even trust himself.\nLater on Krakoa, Sinister sneaks into Emma Frost’s room and attempts to inoculate her with the new gene update. But as he stabs her with the needle, he discovers that she now sleeps in her diamond form for protection[2]. Emma also had telepathic protection from a hidden amphetamine-addledMastermindnearby to ensure no one knew she was invulnerable. Sinister quickly flees through an emergency portal and Emma assembles the Council to go after Sinister.\nThe Council hunts for Sinister around the globe but Emma eventually finds him at his Westchester Complex lab. When she confronts him, she tells Sinister she knew right away where he was going. He shoots her with a weapon that shatters her diamond form, but she counters with a Wolverine adaptation that grows her arm back. Sinister reveals a group of chimeras of theNasty Boyscrossed withCyclops, but Emma takes them out and subdues Sinister. Out of options, Sinister shows Emma the plans forRasputin IV- the chimera with five power sets. Sinister tells Emma that in order to take on the galaxy, they need weapons like Rasputin and that he is the only one with the tools to provide those weapons. Before she brings this proposal to the Council, she makes Sinister beg for mercy. Emma mentally gathers the Council and asks if they forgive his indiscretion for the benefits he will bring them, and they all vote yes. Emma leaves a beaten-down Sinister alone in his lab with his defeated chimera.\nADORED AND RESPECTED!\nNYCC 2022: A Twisted Fate Awaits Mutantkind in 'Sins of Sinister'"

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nYear 100\nAn opening splash page details the happenings since Year 10. The Sinister Council’s Red Diamond Empire is at war with the Interstellar Compact, an alliance of the remaining galactic powers. The Compact is led byOrbis Stellaris.Stormandthe Brotherhoodfight both sides to free everyone from Sinister’s influence and to avenge the destruction of Arakko[1]. Another insurgent cell,Freedom Force, managed to transmit the location of the Compact’s mobile command post to Arakko Base, the Brotherhood’s starship and headquarters.\nA starship namedAnankeapproaches Arakko Base and provides the security code.Noh-Varr, suspicious, asks for the upcoming security code - which has not been generated - and the respondent successfully provides the code. It isDestiny, who enters the ship and recounts past events. In a flashback,Mystiqueleaves to fight as a rebel with her Freedom Force against the Sinisters and Destiny begs her to stay back, but Mystique doesn’t want to be hemmed in and be “a keepsake in (Destiny’s) vault”. Destiny laments that Mystique died fighting for freedom and that simply being together was enough for Destiny, but not for Mystique. Storm arrives and they trade barbs before Storm asks why she’s there. Destiny recounts that they once offered Storm a chance to end the timeline, but instead they stole theMoira lab[2], as Destiny wanted the timeline to continue since it was the timeline in which Mystique lived the longest, but now that Mystique was dead, Destiny wants to kill Moira and reset everything.\nThe Brotherhood dispatch attack ships and arrive at the Death Sphere. The Death Sphere is Orbis Stellaris’ planet-sized sphere that now houses theWorld Farm. Within the World Farm, the enslaved civilization known as theProgenitorsprocess massive amounts of information to help Orbis Stellaris achieve dominionhood. Orbis Stellaris is alerted to the incoming attack and at first assumes it is the Red Diamond Empire. Orbis is dumbfounded at the small scale of the Brotherhood’s attack forces. He dispatches all of their fighter craft to take on the Brotherhood’s ships.\nOn the main ship,Khora of the Burning Heartboosts Destiny’s precognitive powers to help determine what course of action they should take to achieve victory. Destiny sees them winning the battle, hears Storm give the order to destroy the Moira lab, the euphoria of victory, and then senses darkness, meaning the timeline ends with them having won. The specific maneuvering instructions that lead to victory are telepathically sent to the Brotherhood. AsJon Ironfirereceives his instructions,Mother Righteousappears to him as a “daydream”. She asks him if he has any regrets or anything he’d do differently, and he confesses that he made a mistake during the Genesis War that still haunts him, but as penance for that mistake he has faith in “the Storm” now. Observing the remarkable maneuvering, Obris knows Destiny is helping out. The Brotherhood’s ships infiltrate the Death Sphere by entering the hatch that Orbis’ star fighters are leaving from. Since Orbis dispatched all his fighter craft, they are unopposed inside.\nNoh-varr tells Storm that their Black Hole Torpedo is aimed at the World Farm and ready to go. As Storm tells him to fire the weapon, Destiny whispers to the now-dead Mystique “until next time”. Suddenly, a blade splits Destiny’s head in two down the middle. Khora killed Destiny and the darkness that Destiny foresaw earlier was not the timeline resetting, but rather her death. Khora wonders if Destiny had a contingency plan. The whole plan to destroy the World Farm was a ruse, and Noh-varr disarms the torpedo. Noh-varr has doubts about not destroying the Moira lab since “this reality is hell”. Storm counters that their reality still supports hope and that they cannot justify murdering an entire universe.Cable, knowing they are trapped in the Death Sphere, asks what the next step is in her plan.\nKhora amplifies Storm’s powers - “powers beyond powers” that she is “heir to” - and Storm rends time and space to create a wormhole. The Brotherhood and the World Farm (and the Moira lab) leave through the wormhole. Orbis mourns the loss of all the computational power of the World Farm and the Progenitors. A Skrull crew member asks him if something can be done, and he says “something can always be done” and orders the ship’s computer to switch off life support.\nBack with the Brotherhood and their captured World Farm,Gannaasks about the Progenitors inside the World Farm, and Cable responds that an electromagnetic pulse can wipe their current orders and without a leader, they would simply maintain their artificial planets. Ironfire asks Khora if Storm is listening and Khora responds that Storm is dead, with the creation of the wormhole overwhelming her.\nBATTLE OF THE X-PLANETS!"

Following his latest victory, he is led away by armed soldiers back into his hole, a circular pit not much wider than that of a sewer pipe, and is fed the leftovers of his victims.\nAs Daredevil feeds, he hears the voices of many people he helped before his infection, both as his superhero persona and his alter-ego, the lawyer Matt Murdock. He also reflects on the many people he's killed since becoming a zombie, including Black Widow, Foggy Nelson, and a mother and her children.\nThe armed men above are ambushed and killed by Frank Castle, aka the Punisher as he brings a full bag of claymore mines to Daredevil's pit. He offers his former ally a choice-- he can either be killed right now and rid of his torment, or Frank can turn him into a walking bomb to destroy his captors with him the next day.\nThe next day, new armed soldiers arrive, confused by the disappearance of the previous group. They bring Daredevil out of the pit, and back to the ring, where his main captor -- a man nicknamed \"Cap\" --notices the undead hero being more quiet than usual, as well as his body being lumpy and misshapen, and questions if the soldiers fed him too much.\nAs Daredevil is prompted to fight, the mines hidden in his body go off, destroying the fight club and killing everyone inside. On the surface, Punisher hears the screams and sees the explosion leave the sewer pipe before walking away.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nThe Daily Bugle is being swarmed and invaded by the undead hordes. The few that remain uninfected (including J Jonah Jameson) are being protected by Spider-Man, who continues to fight off wave after wave of zombies, even as he feels his hope fading despite his best efforts to hold onto it.\nJonah activates the fire alarm, distracting the undead and allowing Spider-Man a moment to try and contact the Avengers on his watch. He feels his despair grow when he hears only static over his communication device, and is attacked by two more zombies, Betty Brant -- the first girl he ever loved -- and Robbie Robertson -- the first colleague at the Bugle who ever believed in him.\nThen, Hawkeye's voices comes over the comms, telling Spider-Man that the Avengers are on their way. This gives Spider-Man a new burst of hope, but is quickly replaced by horror as he recognizes the next zombie that attacks him is his Aunt May, who seems to be in a rage-induced frenzy as she demands to know where her nephew is.\nDespite May's brutal attacks, Spider-Man refuses to fight back against the woman who raises him. He finally removes his mask, revealing that he is her nephew Peter Parker, which seemingly snaps May back into a conscious state, despite her infection. Unsure of where she is and realizing she's become a monster, she tearfully begs Peter to kill her, which he does, much to his own despair.\nPeter feels the last of his hope leave him, as he gazes at the mutilated corpse of May on the ground, and becomes aware that his arm has been wounded, sealing his fate as the virus begins to take hold. Jonah leaves the room in which the survivors had been hiding out in, attempting to save Peter-- only to find the wallcrawler succumbing to the infection as Peter screams at him to run.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nAN ALL-NEW ERA OF MARVEL ZOMBIES!\n• The undead plague starts here…and you know it won’t stop until everyone’s in its clutches!\n• This first of four action-packed, utterly original, gloriously gory anthology issues features Daredevil, Spider-Man, Moon Knight and many, many more Marvel heroes and villains beset by ever-growing zombie hordes!"

He sent souls to the afterlife and murdered people who don't adhere to death's natural rules, by either cheating death or killing people before their time.\nIf his opponent managed to kill him, they would fight again inPurgatoryonce the opponent died, for the chance to escape the afterlife if they won in Purgatory. Most of the people who were able to beat Azrael twice would become trapped in their earth-bound corpses, unless their fatal wounds could be healed.[6]\nWhen God asked that all first born children ofEgyptto be killed, theAsurawere dispatched,[7]and/or theVoidmanifested,[8]but they were recounted inExodus: 1-13as the Angel of Death.[9]\nWhenLoganhad a near-death experience Azrael (known as Lazaer) arrived to claim his life but Logan fought back defeating him. After his defeat Azrael returned and told Logan that every time he experiences a near-death scenario he will be forced into combating Lazaer, presumably if Logan ever lost one of these fights he would die.[10]\nAzrael circa 1951\nAzrael became interested in the German born scientistBaron Franz Heinrichwho was developing an atomic powered rocket in order to fly toMarsand discover theFountain of Youth. Azrael traveled to Mars and waited for Heinrich to eventually show up. Heinrich did in 1951, taking along with him theOlympianlove goddessVenus, so Venus could cover the story forBeauty Magazine. Azrael posed as aMartianand confronted Heinrich, telling the scientist that the Fountain of Youth belonged to him. This led to a fight between Azrael and Heinrich which led to Heinrich throwing Azrael over a cliff to his seeming death. Heinrich and Venus fled Mars shortly thereafter, believing his Martian ruse and seeking to avoid reprisals for \"killing\" Azrael.[1]Azrael's motivations during this incident were unexplained.\nAzrael was among the angels' names invoked byMorgan Le Fayto harness the power of theEbony Blade, along withMetatron.[4]\nShevaun Haldane's father was killed byMephistofor betraying their pact, and Shevaun was helpless to stop him. As he lay there dead, theAngel of Deathappeared to her, in an effort to claim his soul, which was already taken by Mephisto. The Angel would take pity on Shevaun, granting her a shred of the universe and some armor to give her powers to fight off Hell on Earth.[11]It remains unsure if this Angel of Death was Azriel.[5][2]"

After Beast mounted an attack on X-Force and in light of Beast's years of crimes and atrocities in the name of the greater good, X-Force elected that the only way to stop Beast was with a Beast of their own. They would thus upload Hank McCoy's loneCerebrobackup, dating from many years prior, to the clone. Disoriented and frightened, this new Beast would be placed in a cell under the watch ofBlack Tom Cassidy, but would quickly escape after his jailor fell asleep. Becoming extremely distressed after learning of the atrocities the \"real\" Hank McCoy had committed, the clone would leave the X-Force compound and wander out into the world.[3]\nHe met with his old friendWonder Manand convinced him to go after the original Beast with him, hoping to remind him of his once noble goals. When the duo caught up with Beast underwater, off the coast of California, he removed Wonder Man's breathing apparatus to force him to go back to the surface and give him some time alone with his clone. He showed him his Black Hole Gun and explained his plan to sendArrakoto a cosmic vault for safekeeping. However, the clone wasn't moved by his words and, when the weapon was deployed, they got into a fight. The original Beast tried to end his clone's life, but Wolverine's surprise appearance allowed the clone to free himself. Wolverine then attempted to kill Beast, but the clone was adamant no one should die and tackled Wolverine. Without losing more time, the original Beast escaped, but was shocked to find Wonder Man attempting to stop his weapon. As the gun was about to fire with Wonder Man in front of it, Beast made one final selfless act and sacrificed himself to save his friend's life.[4]"

The fight spills outside where she attacks a passing pedestrian. However, the pedestrian pulls a gun and shoots her several times. A pick-up truck drives up and Wolfsbane dives into the bed while it drives away, escaping. The pedestrian claims he was looking for the purifiers in order to join up, so the Purifiers accept him. The pedestrian is really depowered mutant Rictor, pretending to be a mutant-hater so he can infiltrate the Purifiers on behalf of the X-Men.\nAway from the scene, the driver of the truck is revealed to be Siryn and the bullet wound Rahne received where merely squibs filled with fake blood.\nBack at the X-Men's base, X-23 and Rockslide ask to speak to Cyclops.\nMultiple Man and Layla Miller arrive at Forge's Aerie in Dallas Texas. Forge tells Jamie that he's built a time machine and he wants Jamie to investigate two possible future timelines that demonstrated a mutant presence.\nAt the Sacred Heart Hospital in Santa Cruz, an emergency patient is wheeled into the emergency room. It's Wolverine and he's looking for Amelia Voght, a former member of the Acolytes. She turns into a mist and escapes into a vent. Exiting the hospital, she's stopped by Storms control over the wind. Storm and Nightcrawler question Amelia about the location of the Marauders, former allies of the Acolytes. She agrees to give up their whereabouts.\nBack at Forge's Aerie, Forge has outlined a plan to send two of Jamie's dupes into the future. Jamie warns Forge about the dupes unpredictable nature, but generates them anyway. Just at the moment the second dupe is being sent to the future, Layla Miller jumps on the time machine and goes with him to the future. Jamie urges Forge to reverse the time machine, but he can't; the trips were one way. The dupes each received psychic messages telling them to kill themselves after gathering the information, thereby transferring the knowledge back to the original Jamie's mind. Just as Jamie is about to punch Forge in the face, Jamie's eyes roll up and he passes out.\nAt the X-mansion, Surge, Rockslide, Hellion, X-23, and Mercury question Cyclops on when they can't get involved in the mission. Scott says they have a part to play, but only when and where he says.\nBack with the Purifiers' base, Rictor is scanned for mutant DNA. Since he was depowered on M-Day, he registers as negative. After Rictor passes, the Purifiers reveal the extent of their resources by showing him their massive weapons arsenal."

When he turns his back, he finds theInhumansoffering help.\nWeeks later inManhattan, theAvengersare getting back on their feet after being beaten up by the unidentified army of aCelestial. WhileSpider-Manquestions if that's the best course of action,Iron Maninforms him they have to stick to the plan. As they charge at the enemies, the cavalry arrives in the form of the Inhumans, theX-Men,A-Force, theUltimates, theAvengers Unity Division, and theNew Avengers. The heroes hold the line against the invaders asMagikteleportsDoctor Strangeand several other magicians to the scene, as planned. The magic users conjure theGroup Spell of Dimension Reversalfrom theBook of the Vishanti, transporting the Celestial back whence it came from, and closing the rift it used to arrive in this dimension in the process.\nThe next evening, all of the heroes present in the scene attend a celebratory party at theStark Tower. Tony Stark makes a toast to the Inhumans, who are thanked for making the victory possible, as they had warned the Avengers of the upcoming threat; however, the heroes don't know how did the Inhumans do that, soMedusais eventually approached by both Tony Stark andCaptain Marvelwith that question. After consulting with her fellow Inhumans, Medusa asks a handful of the heroes to meet privately in the kitchen.\nShe introduces them to Ulysses, who is revealed to have the ability to unwillingly have visions into the future after undergoingTerrigenesiswhen theTerrigen cloudhithis college. Captain Marvel offers him to work with the Ultimates, as their purpose is to preemptively tackle disasters before they happen; however, Tony frowns upon the idea, suggesting it's dangerous to take his visions at face value, considering the ability to prevent the events Ulysses sees from happening means he doesn't have access to anything set in stone; furthermore,Marvel Girlcannot read his mind to verify what he's saying is indeed what he saw. The fact that so little is known about how Ulysses' powers exactly work and their efficacy also worries Stark. Carol argues that using him is the right thing to do, considering it was effective in defeating the Celestial.\nBefore continuing the debate, Stark asks Ulysses to tell more about him. When he was a vision, Ulysses vividly experiences it, overwhelming him. After being brought into the Inhumans,Magister Karnakhelped the young boy control his abilities to be able to understand them. The first clear vision he had was that of the world ending as a consequence of the Celestial, but that has been stopped. Stark subsequently brings up the morality behind using Ulysses, wondering if it's okay to stop and punish a person for something they could potentially do, and might not even know they'd do. Before leaving the rest of the heroes, Tony warns Carol that they need to be careful about Ulysses' visions and what course of action could be taken based on them.\nThree weeks later in the middle of the night atNew Attilan, Ulysses is awakened by a vision. He panics, and when Medusa comes to his aid, he insists they need to call the Ultimates.\nIn his laboratory, Tony Stark is testing the abilities ofhis armor's stealth mode whenMJ Watsoninterrupts him to inform him thatJim Rhodeshas passed away. Tony quickly flies to theTriskelion, demanding to see his best friend's corpse. After seeing the damage done toRhodey's armor, Tony urges, on the verge of tears, to be told how did this happen, calling out Carol Danvers. He's directed to one of aid stations in the Triskelion's medical wing. Stark enters the tent to find Captain Marvel sitting in a chair next to a comatoseShe-Hulk. When he asks her what happened, Carol reveals that the Ultimates used the information from one of Ulysses' visions to ambushThanosat theProject P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Facility, and Rhodey was killed by Thanos in combat. Tony blames Carol of the tragedies caused by this incident, but Carol clarifies that Rhodey had gone into battle willingly and that she'd do it again, considering at least Thanos was neutralized and apprehended.\nTony furiously leaves the building, claiming he'll make sure nobody will try to play god again. Right after he leaves, She-Hulk awakens, barely conscious, and asks Carol to fight for using Ulysses. Her vital signs immediately go flat, and the doctors rush to attempt to resuscitate her. Carol is separated from She-Hulk, and breaks out in tears.\nIT’S HERE!"

As Felicia sleeps Peter laments that they don't talk afterwards not about Diablo, not about breaking into Dexter Bennett's house, not about finding a corpse made of stone or about their 'relationship' as her twirls Felicia's hair around his fingers. Peter worries about getting very close to Felicia without the mask on and how much it scares him especially with her potentially seeing his unmasked face even though the room was pitch black, the shades were 'enough to keep out July', that Felicia promised not to look, the element of trust even the one between him and Black Cat is hard to come by. Peter tries to ask Felicia about the events of the last issue but talking isn't Felicia's thing and she whispers to Peter for him to wait until morning and then they can 'play grown up' before going back to sleep. Despite this, for reasons that Peter is afraid to consider he is totally okay with that, even though Peter knows Felicia and himself are defiantly not playing grown up. As Peter sleeps Felicia disappears. A newly wedded couple comes into their room out of nowhere. Spidey is jolted awake and barely gets out with his costume on. Spiderman notes as he swings through the city, laughing to himself, that it was the best night of sleep he's had for a month and doesn't feel an ounce of guilt about it.\nPeter returns to his apartment glad that there are no 'crazy ladies' waiting for him at his apartment as the smile on his face takes a few hours to fade with Peter noting that Michele would have surely 'popped a vessel' for sure if she ever saw the smile on his face. Spidey then tracks down Dexter Bennett at the Daily Bugle, showing him an image of the dead guy who was lying in his safe. Bennett confesses that the man is Bernie Mayer, a former business partner of his that he had a falling out with many years ago. Spidey also notices the newspaper article with him and Cat sharing a kiss on the front page.\nSpidey then makes a stakeout at Mayer's warehouse. Black Cats's bad luck powers alerts him to Cat's presence. Black Cat says she thought his spider sense only went off when danger was present, Spidey says when he squashed a fist full of rat shit while his underwear ripped he knew Felicia was nearby. Spidey tries asking Black Cat about the ledger book she stole from Bennett but Felicia ignores his questions and gets intimate with him until Spider-Man hears a ringer.\nDown below, Diablo uses his science to erase peoples minds. Then suddenly, Spider-Man crashes right through the glass window and slams into him. As Black Cat assists him, Diablo uses one of his capsules to liquefy the cement beneath their feet. Spider-Man manages to tear himself from the ground and smash the solid cement against a pipe. However, Diablo unleashes a gold-like substance that slowly encases Black Cat and Spider-Man and cutting off their air. As he tries leaving, Black Cat's bad luck powers kick in and one of his capsules falls from Diablo's belt and dissolves the substance freeing Spider-Man and Black Cat. Spidey then flings web balls at him before trying CPR on Cat with Spidey noting that's the first time he's slipped in the tongue doing CPR.  Cat says Spidey can do some 'chest compressions' if he wants but the wall crawler says they should capture Diablo first, Black Cat then calls Spider a spoilsport. Diablo then escapes in a cloud of smoke.\nBack at the Daily Bugle, Spidey realizes that Mayer had 20,000 tons of steel but refused to disclose it's origin to Bennett. But that steel was made by Diablo and not meant to last. Already there is a building made of that steel. Cat then asks Spidey if he trusts her, for there are parts of the puzzle that she has to solve alone. He asks if she kept the lights off and did not look at his unmasked face; she replies no. Spidey says that he trusts her and Black Cat leaves to solve her mystery and thanks the Wall Crawler before mentioning to get as much webbing that he can spin.\nSoon enough Cat informs Spidey of the building, which he covers entirely in his webbing and the building is evacuated by the fire brigade. J Jonah Jameson tries to get into the people's good books while this happen, until Spidey knocks off his hat with a web ball. He then rejoins Cat on a rooftop, where he informs her that Diablo killed Mayer and was after Bennett and the building's collapse was meant to hide something and Diablo would have received a hefty insurance payout due to all the many small businesses that were secretly owned by Diablo in the building. The problem is though, what was he trying to cover up. Black Cat and Spider-man then discuss the events of last night and agree to a no-strings attached relationship before sharing a passionate kiss with Black Cat mentioning to Spidey to keep his mask on this time. Spider then says with a smile on his face that he 'is in so much trouble'.\nIn Diablo's lair, he listens to the news report where Mayor Jamison has taken credit for evacuating the building before the building collapsed much to his fury. Then, Ana Kravinov enters, stating that her mother would like a word with him.\nhttp://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12940"

Acknowledging the perks that come with the relationship, she remembered the sleepless nights and endangerment by villains, but despite the repeated break ups and restarts, they would always lose someone close. These losses would have them re-examine life and begin the relationship again. Mary Jane found that she fell in love with him for his drive to helping and saving people, in spite of past suffering, with an appreciation for his ability to free himself with humor, having enjoyed his jokes. Yet in reflection, Mary Jane doubted her extroverted self complimented Peter's nature, wondering if he would be happier with someone more like his superhero exes. Afterwards, Mary Jane thankedJarvisfor the meeting, as he reminded her that she was indispensable to Peter because of her strength and character.\nIn theThieves Guildstorehouse,Black CatandOdessatraded remarks as Odessa infuriated Spider-Man by not saying his name with a hyphen. Given that Felicia paid her dues, she could not be hurt or killed, and she maintained that while some items were fair game, most of the treasures were needed to keep people safe, thus she was against the Guild's \"comeback\". Disappointed, Odessa ordered her subordinates to kill Spider-Man, while Odessa tried to sway Felicia back to following the guild. With no luck as Felicia continued her defiance, Odessa instead had her mages ready to cast both vigilantes into the Guild's True Vault, a mystical pocket dimension accessible only to the Guild mages.\nRacing to prevent their eternal imprisonment, Spider-Man locatedMs. Marvel's backpack and activated a Find my Phone app to signal theAvengers. Elsewhere, whileReed RichardsandTony Starktried to locate the missing items, Ms. Marvel called their attention to her Find My Phone app which pinged the target location, embarrassing the veteran heroes. With the swarm of heroes inbound, Odessa was forced to order a retreat, ending the spell prematurely and left the stolen goods. While excited his planned worked, Felicia corrected him as the Guild got their notoriety back, as more common thieves, robbers and crooks shall pay their dues. Once the heroes arrive, their bombastic entry caused Spider-Man and Black Cat to jostle into a misconstrued scene.\nSpider-Man unmasks again to Black Cat\nAt night, Spidey and Felicia talked briefly about the Heist before mentioning their awkward reunion as partners, and confirmed to each other they were seeing a respective significant other. Felicia admitted to being in a dark place in her life, but going back to whenSuperior Spider-Mandevastated her life, she realized that she didn't remember who Spider-Man was under the mask. Spider-Man revealed that amemory alteration spellwas used to restore his secret identity, but the removal of her knowing him also removed a part of her past. Seeing how much his secrecy harmed Felicia, Peter decided to unmask himself and trust her again with his secret identity, to which the two hugged as friends again.\nReturning to Mary Jane's apartment, Peter updated her on his day with Felicia and Mary Jane calmed his worry as she wasn't jealous. Elsewhere, themysterious bandaged entitywas enraged that Peter shared his identity with Felicia again, blaming him for dragging her into his personal hell. But in a breath of promise, the entity swore that in the end, it would only be him and Peter.\n• There’s been a major theft the likes of which we’ve never seen and for once, The Black Cat didn’t do it."

He appeals to her fandom forCarolin order to snap her out of the shock by using the \"Slingshot\" maneuver he created with Carol. Kamala wants to keep fighting, suggesting they try a \"Fastball Special\" next, but Spidey tells her that they must focus on retrieving the cocoon. As they approach,oneof the thugs complains that he accepted the job because Minerva wasn't an enemy of Spider-Man (since he refuses to take any jobs that involves Spider-Man), but takes advantage of the situation so he can modify his Sonic Scanner into a weapon. Spidey and Kamala try to escape with the cocoon, but Kamala's size makes her an easy target, and as she fights against Minerva the cocoon starts to hatch.\nMeanwhile, asCindy Moonponders on her rent status, she is called to assistNatalie Longat theFact Channel. Natalie reviews the battle between Silk andElectroand considers making her their \"exclusive\" just like theBugledid with Spider-Man, but criticizes Silk's outfit as tacky. Just as Natalie gets a report on two crimes, one being Spidey's battle, Cindy escapes to deal with the other situation, determined to become the Fact Channel's exclusive by making herself a new outfit.\nThe cocoon hatches revealing a seemingly human baby inside, which Kamala takes to keep him safe while Spidey battles Minerva. The henchmen take down Kamala while she keeps the baby safe, but as she confronts them one of the henchmen turns against the rest, showing moral qualms about attacking someone carrying a baby. The henchman takes off his mask so that he won't scare the baby and then joins Spider-Man, who explains that Kamala knows everything about the Kree thanks to her knowledge of Carol Danvers, while the henchman is a local. This prompts Spidey to ask Minerva if she is indeed working for the Kree Empire, since it's rare that she's using local people instead of Kree Soldiers, and Minerva insists that her activities are fully sanctioned by the Kree Empire. Spidey fakes a call to Jarvis in Avengers Tower to ask the Kree if they know about Minerva's activities in order to call her bluff, which succeeds, forcing her her escape the site.\nAt the other robbery site, The Ringer attempts to escape, only to be taken down quickly by Silk, making her first appearance in her new outfit in front of Natalie Long and the cameras of the Fact Channel, saying that it was time for a change.\nSpidey and Kamala bring the baby to the hospital so he can be taken care of with his parents. Kamala worries since they don't know what powers she might have, but Spider-Man insists that they love her and that will be a good start. He says he has to leave to make an alert atAvengers Towerabout Minerva and compliments Kamala, seeing a reflection of his past self when he was a teenage superhero dealing with the double life. He encourages her, saying that she'll do fine, then confronts the henchman, who swears that he was trying to find legit work but nobody wants to hire a man with a criminal record since juvie, only to be stunned when Spidey recognizes him as Clayton Cole, his first rival, formerly known as Clash, which surprised Clayton. Spidey sees that Clayton really wants to go straight and change his life, but no one wants to hire a man with \"Supervillain since fifteen\" on their resume, so he gives him a card fromParker Industries, claiming that Parker believes in second chances and to tell him he sent him. He takes it and by the next day he is officially hired into Peter's company.

Unfortunately, in this situation, the government would send in the Avengers, but Osborn's Avengers are the primary attack force, which includes H.A.M.M.E.R. and the entirety of the Initiative. The President orders the army to arrest Osborn and his team, when he is informed of a new development: Captain America and Nick Fury just arrived on the scene, leading their own team of Avengers.\nAt the battlefield, Captain America gives the rally cry of \"Avengers Assemble\", throwing his shield at Osborn. Balder proudly welcome Thor's allies help. While the Avengers fight it out with the Dark Avengers, Thor goes for the Sentry, but he takes every hit like they're nothing. Just then, the Hood appears with his gang, summoned by Loki. Meanwhile, Speed rushes through Broxton, carrying a suitcase given by Jarvis, when Maria Hill threatens to shoot him. Speed explains that Captain America sent him with something for Tony Stark. Stark tells Maria to let him in.\nAt this point, the United States military is ready to begin carpet bombing the area, but the President isn't willing to endanger the people fighting for them. One of his advisers states that Osborn not only declared war on Asgard, but on America itself. Therefore, the President orders that Captain America's Avengers be left to the ground battle, while the Air Force takes down H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarrier. With such unexpectedness, Victoria Hand orders the crew to abandon ship.\nAs Osborn fight Captain America, trying to declare that he is under arrest for treason, he learns that his armor is shutting down, and sees Iron Man in his Mark IV armor, telling him the Iron Patriot armor is about to shut down, given that it ishistechnology.

Stymied by the lack of a mailbox, he installs one and labels it Asgard, 1 Asgard Rd before depositing the letter and driving off. Thor, having observed this strange mortal custom, flies down and discovers that they have been invited to a town meeting at the Broxton Town Hall. Returning to the castle, Thor finds Heimdall, who informs the thunder god of a troubling development. Not only is the watchman of Asgard still unable to detect any trace of the goddess Sif, but the essences he can detect are mysteriously vanishing. Instead of the dormant gods, he senses a growing darkness in the desert between Nevada and New Mexico.\nThor immediately flies to the site, where he finds a fence and a sign describing various dire punishments for trespassing on a Restricted Area. Ignoring the sign completely, Thor finds an old bunker, with dozens of people inside. They tell Thor that something has kidnapped them from all over the world. A raven-haired woman in a wedding dress claims to know him, but before Thor can free them, booming steps emanate from the hallway. The unknown offender reveals itself to be the Destroyer Armor, and engages Thor in combat. Inside himself, Thor and Don discuss how this is possible and why, and come to the conclusion that the Destroyer intends to kill the hosts so that no new  Asgardians are reborn. Thor counter-attacks, taking the fight outside. Thor orders the Destroyer to cease fighting, to which it responds that Thor is the destroyer, and states his intention to kill him.\nThor flies up over the bunker, leaving himself open to the Destroyer's attack, and uses Mjolnir to free the Asgardians in an attempt to bring in reinforcements. However, the hammer affects the Destroyer as well, freeing Balder the Brave. Balder explains how he raged against the destruction of Asgard, and hated himself for failing to prevent Ragnarok. After his death, something sensed his rage and pulled him into the Destroyer where he began collecting the Asgardian hosts until Thor freed him. Thor forgives him, but is baffled by the absence of the freed Asgardians. He goes back below where one of the people tells him that they all left except for the one that came out of the female that said she knew Thor.\nAssuming that it is Sif, Thor goes over and welcomes his lover back to the world of the living. The lady replies that he must be mistaking her for someone else, and turns around to reveal a female Loki. Loki tells a shocked Thor that he should not be surprised since she is not a child of Asgard, but of Frost Giants. Thor reminds her that she died and was reborn by his hands, but is willing to give her this one chance. Later, Loki converses with Doctor Doom over their evil scheme. With Thor distracted by the Destroyer, he will work to free as many Asgardians as quickly as possible without considering who he is freeing, and in doing so release the Asgardian villians. Back in Oklahoma, Volstagg arrives at the town meeting with a number of other Asgardians, in search of cake."

Agamotto explains that he knows the threat at hand: it's one of theCelestials, a race of almighty giants as old as time itself, but this one is more deranged and seems to be looking for something inside the Earth. Odin leads the group with the goal of killing the monster, forming a legacy that would get all the way to today'sAvengers.\nIn present day,Robbie Reyes, the current Ghost Rider, wakes up from a dream where he was living the previously described experience of his ancestor. He finds himself in his car, being questioned by a police officer. He impulsively decides to run away as he realizes he somehow went from Los Angeles to Cape Town, in South Africa. Suddenly, he's attacked by the currentStarbrandof Earth, its inherent defense mechanism, who intends to protect his planet by keeping something that lays nearby hidden. Robbie is confused and tries to explain to Starbrand that he has no idea what he's talking about, but Starbrand seems determined to kill him. Robbie's car intervenes, attacking Starbrand and letting him transform into his superhero form.\nOnJotunheim, land of theFrost Giants,Lokiis addressing a group of human-sized outcast Giants to stand up to their name and stop being a disappointment. Claiming that tonight's mission will change the world's vision of them, Loki sends them to Earth to retrieve a powerful object that will give them the power to change worlds. As the Giants pass through the portal, Loki explains that he's deceiving them, for he actually wants to save the world.\nIn a classified location, twoS.H.I.E.L.D.agents are accessing a S.H.I.E.L.D. Storage Facility with a group of U.S. Army soldiers. Apparently, they're being tasked with moving every one of the crates storaged in the high-security location after S.H.I.E.L.D.'s shut down. There's one crate, Vol 1 4-1939, that was never recorder and whose content is unknown, though, and it happens to be the one Loki's Giants are supposed to steal. The Giants, for the occasion of the mission rebaptizedBlack Ice Berserkers, teleport in and attack the soldiers. Fortunately, the soldiers have brought along superhuman back-up.\nSeconds later, the ceiling of Sublevel Nine, where the scuffle is taking place, is smashed byMjolnir, and two of the Avengers, currentThorandCaptain America, turn up, attacking the Giants. One of the foes takes a hostage, but is hit from behind byIronheart, the \"backup for the backup.\" Crate Vol 1 4-1939 starts glowing with a blue light.\nIn a diner in the middle of the desert,Steven Rogersis listening to Roxx News. They talk about a nationwide manhunt forDeadpool, the rise in popularity ofWilson Fiskas possible mayor of New York City, and, most importantly, they wonder where does Captain America hide.

Apparently, the comatoseTony Starkhas vanished from his room and there were no signs of him waking up or of anybody entering the room.\nBack to the fight between Starbrand and Ghost Rider, while the former seems to be taking the upper hand in the dispute, he explains that the times ahead are going to try them all, reshaping everything they know, especially for those whose hosts were there from the beginning, like the two of them.\nIn the Great Karoo Region, South Africa, two agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on their last day are escorting two archeologists, who appear to be about to excavate an uncanny finding. Suddenly, the Starbrand lands between them in an explosion: he's terrorized by the fact that the \"fallen\" is drawing him there and he resolves once again to not let the Rider find the location. After the scare, the archeologists decide to keep digging.\nIn a Roxxie Burger restroom stall, Deadpool is asking forgiveness (in his own way) toGodfor his sins, when he's attacked by policemen who intend to arrest him for the murder of agentPhil Coulson. He's unimpressed, and resumes praying as he's riddled with bullets.\nAt theSanctum Sanctorum,Doctor StrangetellsIron Fistthat someone tried to enter his sacred house, but fortunately his magic shrubbery stopped him. That person, walking away from the mansion, isNorman Osborn.\nAt theAvengers Mansion,JarvistellsNadia Van Dyne, a.k.a. the Wasp, that he feels something is wrong, although everything seems perfectly normal.

Starbrand feels all the people who died because of him and implodes, vanishing and leaving Robbie without his powers. He's confused by the situation, so he resolves to never sleep in his car again. He drives away from the scene, unaware that he is entering into the aforementioned archaeological site. Here, the two archaeologists enter the cave they dug and find theCelestial fallen to Earth one million years ago. He wakes up and speaks the following words: \"Summon... the final host. Cleanse them all\" as he kills the archaeologists.\nAt the S.H.I.E.L.D. Facility, the head of the soldiers thanks the Avengers for saving them and capturing the Frozen Giants. Meanwhile, the one Giant who ran away with the case asks for Loki to open the portal and take him back home, but is run over by a beer truck. The Giant is furious, and ready to kill the driver, but he's easily defeated by him, revealed to beLogan, apparently back from the dead. Meanwhile,Jean Greyfinds the Adamantium casing inside whichLoganhad died opened up. She then salutes the return of her old friend. Back to the scene of the confrontation between Wolverina and the Giant, Logan rests after having killed his enemy.

It repeats \"Summon... the Final Host\" and Loki agrees to it.\nThe narrator of this story is revealed to beValeria Richards. She ends her story by saying that never before in the history of theuniversecataclysm has been looming in so many different ways at the same time and never before heroes have appeared so uncapable of escaping them. She proceeds to create another universe and then races her brother,Franklin Richardsto the next one.\nEVERYTHING STARTS HERE!"

Fury, Johnny, Ben and Mahr Vehl also land below (with the latter being knocked unconscious). Seeing that the debris might be too strong for Susan to have held up, Ben digs through the debris to where Susan and Rick were standing, but finds them missing.\nRick has teleported himself and Susan to Project Pegasus to escape from the falling debris, and find the entire facility in ruins and its personnel killed from Mahr Vehl's rampage. Susan demands Rick teleport themselves back to New York, but they then see a mysterious figure inside Pegasus.\nBack in New York, the Roxxon Brain Trust are at a sub basement of Roxxon Industries where they discuss the attacks on Roxxon and the Baxter Building. Dr. Sterns shares his strong theory that the attacks are nothing but a robbery, in which the properties in common possessed entire objects and work of immense scientific importance, and are now either destroyed or stolen. Misty Knight and Layla Miller have suspicions about Drew and the former then questions her about her original career at the Baxter Building. This outs her after Drew erroneously claims that Dr. Miller worked at the Baxter Building, which she didn't.\nIn Pegasus, Susan sneaks into the ruins where she finds the same creatures that attacked Jessica Drew and Peter Parker's home are stealing Pegasus's artifacts and entering into a dimensional portal. Her presence is accidentally alerted by Rick Jones and Rick calls her by name. The leader of the creatures calls to Sue and repeats a comment he has often made to her in the past, \"You always were just a teeny bit smarter than me\", while revealing himself to be a still-alive Reed Richards!"

He changes into a monstrous feral being and immediately attacks Project Pegasus.\nMeanwhile in New York, Jessica Drew infiltrates the Roxxon Corporation by posing as a hired employee under the alias Dr. Julia Carpenter. At the Baxter Building, Ben Grimm, Susan and Johnny Storm and a disguised Nick Fury investigate the site of the attack. Susan finds some residue from the entity that attacked the building. She believes that it appeared from some sort of dimensional teleportation. Another peculiarity Sue notes is that the entity seemed to grow on contact and then lost the hold on its form, causing it to fall apart before she and the other heroes could stop it. Susan theorizes that the being may have appeared by growing out of technology. Suddenly, Rick Jones teleport himself and a mutated Mahr Vehl to the Baxter Building - as Rick is unable to fight alone against Mahr Vehl - he brings the mutated Mahr Vehl to the Baxter Building where Ben Grimm immediately engages him with his new powers."

However, when Jennifer mentions Thundra, attacks again. Her personal computer Boudicca warns her that they have a little over 4 hours to complete their mission. Lyra isn't interested in the mission anymore since her opponent knows her mother. Meanwhile, the blow from Lyra has sent She-Hulk crashing into an expensive condominium. As the owners complain about the damage she caused, when Lyra arrives to resume the battle. The scene is being observed by Norman Osborn and Ares in Avengers Tower. Ares questions why they don't go and kill them, but Osborn wants this fiasco to work to his advantage of having ARMOR shut down so that HAMMER can get ahold of its resources. Meanwhile, the Sentry overhears Alexander Erde telling his fellow ARMOR agents about his encounter with Lyra and how she is searching for the greatest hero of this era. He quickly flies outside to ask more information about this. Meanwhile, the battle between She-Hulk and Lyra continues. When She-Hulk mentions that Thundra became a hero, this angers Lyra even more. As they battle each other, Lyra thinks back to the events that led her to coming to the present...\n... In the 23rd century of Earth-8009, Lyra and her fellow Femazons were on a mission to recover a device that would restore their birthing cradles to operational order. Along the way, they are attacked by an army of Berserkers, male barbarians who worship Wolverine. Lyra and her fellow warriors fight off their attackers, but one of the women is seriously wounded. When Lyra tries to treat her, the woman refuses to be touched by Lyra because she is the only women in their society who was a natural birth. The woman later dies and when Nella tries to comfort her, but Lyra is certain that the dead woman said what they are all thinking. As they press on, Boudicca to keep her temper in check. They soon arrive in the ruins of St. Louis a male stronghold which consists of the Crawlers, Men of Gold, Goblinkin, and the Wargods. While the other women hold off the male hordes, Lyra goes off to complete her mission. In an ancient Origins Unlimited Meta Science Center. There she activates a tour robot named Ismene who informs her that this facility was used to grant normal humans with superhuman powers. After listening to the recording, Lyra goes on and find the male's cradle. There she takes the needed part, from the device, even though it will mean the extinction of men. When Lyra has her concerns about doing this, Boudicca warns her not to let her sisters hearing her speak such blasphemy. Just as she says so, Nella is lunging out from behind, prepared to stab Lyra in the back.\n... Lyra's recollection ends when she and She-Hulk crash into the street. Lyra lets slip that Thundra is her mother and suddenly weakens. She-Hulk realizes that Lyra gets weaker the angrier she gets. Before She-Hulk can learn anymore, the Sentry grabs She-Hulk and tosses her away. When he introduces himself as the greatest hero of the era, Lyra tells him that he's not, the man she is looking for is Norman Osborn.

Many of its former hosts were filled with rage and corrupted it into a predatory monster, but two of them -- Spider-Man and Flash Thompson -- showed it there was a better way and taught it to be a hero. Its current host, Lee Price, is less than upstanding in that regard.\nIn the present, Price snaps at Agent Wambaugh to get out of his way or die. Wambaugh orders Venom to release the hostage or be shot with his bazooka, and his partner, Agent Bagman, recognizes the Venom symbiote and expresses shock that it is a villain. Taking advantage of the distraction, Firebug blasts Venom with a torrent of flames, causing the symbiote to reel in pain, tossing Firebug through the wall of one of the surrounding apartments. Price orders the symbiote to pull itself together or they'll both die, but it refuses to stay bonded with him. Deciding to bond with one of the FBI agents, it separates from Price, who struggles to keep it bonded to himself. The symbiote grabs Wambaugh and starts to bond with him, but Bagman shoots Price in the chest three times in retaliation. The symbiote tries to calm the panicking Wambaugh, who yells at Bagman to hit it with fire, then notices Price bleeding out nearby. Faced by the hypocrisy of telling Wambaugh it's duty is to save lives and letting even someone as despicable as Price die, the symbiote lets go of Wambaugh and plugs Price's injury, picking him up in its jaws and carrying him away.\nAt the Black Cat gang's headquarters, Mac Gargan asks Black Cat if she saved Lee Price's vomit. Disgusted, Black Cat asks him why he'd think she'd do that, and Gargan responds that Price was lying to them. Adams, Black Cat's lieutenant, looks up from reading the newspaper and asks Gargan what he expected to find in Price's vomit. Gargan pulls out photos from the botched arms deal, pointing out that the wounds sustained by the dead gang members aren't from gunshots and that Price lied to them. Black Cat sarcastically responds that if she refused to work with liars she wouldn't have any employees, and that all they know was that there was a superhuman ambush, suggesting that the Kingpin might be responsible. Gargan accuses Price of being responsible, but Black Cat remains skeptical, saying that at worst that would make Price guilty of trying too hard to work for her.\nPrice has a vision of Tony, who coldly states that there's not much to say these days since Price murdered him. Eyes glowing red, Tony states that there's something black inside Price, who retorts that it's been there all along and just needed something to set it free, Venom's shadow looming behind him. Waking up in Tony's apartment, Price inquires why the symbiote brought him there, and it states that it saw in his memories that this was the only place he considered to be safe. Price asks it why it saved him when it hates him, and it responds that while it does hate him, it wasn't going to let him die when it's its duty to protect life. Smirking, Price states it didn't seem too concerned with protecting Firebug when it tossed him into the apartments, and the symbiote ashamedly stammers that the fire caused it to lash out. Price tries to reassure it, stating that it's like a dog — smart when it's calm but acting on instinct when spooked — and that itthinksit wants to be a hero, but what it really wants is for someone to be in charge of it. Before the symbiote can respond, Agent Wambaugh kicks the door down and points an assault rifle at Price, who asks how they found him. Wambaugh retorts that it wasn't hard when he's a known associate of a member of Black Cat's gang.\nPrice tries to talk his way out of a fight, saying they must be mistaken, but Wambaugh retorts that they got a good look at his face in the alley. Dropping the act, Price coldly states that he could easily kill Wambaugh and that the rifle would be useless, ignoring the symbiote's manifestation saying that it won't let him kill Wambaugh and that in his weakened state it could probably stop him. Price mentally retorts that Wambaugh doesn't know that, just as Wambaugh states that if Price transforms into Venom his partner will open fire using the high-ordinance incendiary bazooka. Looking out the window, Price sees Agent Bagman standing on the roof of an apartment across the street aiming the bazooka at him, and calmly states that Wambaugh would definitely die if that happened, but that might not be enough to kill him. Wambaugh agrees that it might not, but notes that he knows that Price has the Venom symbiote and has taken steps to keep everyone — including his criminal allies — from finding out about it, saying the FBI isn't there to arrest him. Price responds that he's listening, and Wambaugh lays down an ultimatum: if Price were to attack, either he dies in the ensuing explosion or Black Cat realizes something is off and comes gunning for Price when she realizes he was playing her, leaving him exposed and hunted by every police agency and superhero on the planet. However, Wambaugh extends the offer of working for the FBI as an informant, appealing to Price's pragmatic nature and saying to meet him in front of Parker Industries at noon the next day. As Wambaugh leaves, the symbiote says it can understand that Price is angry at being forced into action, but expresses eagerness to be working on the side of good again. Price tells it to shut up, asking if it honestly thinks Wambaugh is any better a person than he is just because he carries a badge.\nAt Black Cat's headquarters, Adams approaches Gargan and shows him a picture of Price's destroyed apartment, asking if he did that. Gargan sarcastically retorts that it wasn't him, and is surprised when he learns who the apartment belonged to, asking if Price is dead. Adams states that no bodies were recovered, saying he just thought that given his earlier suspicions Gargan had taken matters into his own hands. Gargan rebukes him for thinking he'd go behind Black Cat's back, but Adams says that he understands that Gargan is concerned about something that Black Cat doesn't comprehend. He admits he was wrong about the fire, saying that Gargan is more the type to listen to his gut and do what needs to be done personally, saying that's why Black Cat hired him in the first place as he walks away. Admitting Adams is right about that, Gargan turns and regards the Scorpion armor.\n• After working as a Guardian of the Galaxy and a Space Knight, all of the Venom symbiote’s good deeds have left it abandoned, starving and alone…\n• Bonded to a new host — far crueler than Flash Thompson ever was — the symbiote finds itself returning to its old ways."

Pursuing them areSpider-ManandMockingbird, in a futuristic-lookingSpider-Mobile. Spider-Man sings a theme song, and when Mockingbird tells him to stop he activates an auto tune function. Mockingbird tells him that herS.H.I.E.L.D.training affords her fourteen ways of killing him, and Spider-Man shuts the auto tune off just as he receives a message alert fromNick Fury, Jr.who asks Mockingbird for a status report. She informs him that the Zodiac broke into Parker Industries' Shanghai branch and made off with its servers, which would allow them to hack into the Webware devices. Fury tells them to not let it fall into Zodiac's hands, and Spider-Man tells him he has no intention of letting S.H.I.E.L.D. have access to it either, cutting off Fury's protests by threatening to stop designing tech for S.H.I.E.L.D. if necessary.\nAs they swerve to avoid energy bolts, Spider-Man boasts of his superior driving skills, courtesy of his superhuman reflexes, Spider-Sense... and private lessons. In the driver's seat of the Zodiacs' getaway car,Leotells his grunts to take out the road. As Mockingbird complains that the Spider-Mobile is slowing down, Spider-Man tells her not to worry about crashing because it has web-fluid airbags. The Zodiac thugs blow up a car, destroying the road, but as they gloat the Spider-Mobile tails them, driving along the underside of the overpass. Cheered on by the citizens of Shanghai, Spider-Man switches the steering over to Mockingbird and opens the roof, addressing his fans in Mandarin, which he picked up taking his driving lessons. The Spider-Mobile's wheels unfold into insectoid legs and it flips over, cutting off the Zodiacs' escape. Spider-Man jumps onto the hood of their car, displaying a couple of the new webbing types he developed: micro-coiled Z-metal \"Bug Zappers\" capable of being electrified, and shock-absorbing expanding web-foam. The Zodiacs' car crashes and Spider-Man checks on the citizens to see if anyone's hurt. When one of them reprimands him for letting the Leo Sect escape, Spider-Man states he's delegating their apprehension to Mockingbird, who knocks the grunts out and interrogates Leo as to why Zodiac has been trying to steal the Webware servers. Leo bites a suicide pill, but Spider-Man shoots him with an antidote he developed, griping that he's tired of them killing themselves. Mockingbird accuses him of adhering to his \"no-one dies around me\" idealism, but Spider-Man tells her he's not so naïve anymore and simply wants to save everyone he can.\nAs they return to Parker Industries to check out the crime scene, Mockingbird teases Spider-Man for his dramatic speech. A young Chinese woman,Lian Tang, exits a nearby vehicle and reprimands Spider-Man for taking the Spider-Mobile without her permission. When Spider-Man brushes her complaints aside by stating it's his car, Lian snaps that the Spider-Mobile doesn't belong to him but to her and Peter, since they designed and built it together. Lian threatens to report Spider-Man to Peter, saying that they are very close in a manner that implies physical intimacy, and Mockingbird quietly teases Spider-Man for sleeping around. Changing the subject, Spider-Man introduces her to other members of his staff:Min Wei, Peter Parker's personal secretary;Dr. Yao Wu, the head of the bio-tech division; andPhillip Chang, in charge of renewable energies research. Min inquires as to Peter's whereabouts since he has a press conference in ten minutes, and Spider-Man remarks that he knows where to find Peter as he enters an elevator. Changing out of his costume and into a business suit, Peter psyches himself up for the worldwide press conference.\nLater, in front of a crowd of reporters, Peter denounces rumors that he built the Webware industry in China to exploit cheap labor, stating that he's paying fair wages and is not out to build a fortune, but to build the future. Citing hisUncle Ben, Peter explains that his intent is to make sure that the world superheroes risk their lives to save is one worth saving, announcing theUncle Ben Foundation- using technologies to help the less fortunate and improve standards of living around the world - as his next venture. When a reporter accuses him of being a \"poor man's Tony Stark\" for having Spider-Man as the company's mascot and his personal bodyguard, Peter replies that unlikeTonyhe capped his salary at a middle management level. After the conference ends, Peter asks Min Wei how he did, and she reveals his fly was down and tells him the corporate jet is waiting to take him back to theStates. On board the jet, Peter places a call toHobie Brown, who's been operating as Spider-Man inSan Francisco. Hobie laments that he'd rather be out as the Prowler, and Peter remarks that he pays Hobie more than he himself makes, asking him to come to a wedding that evening.\nThat evening, Peter, Hobie, andSajani Jaffreyattend the wedding ofMax ModellandHector Baez. Despite them having fallen out during the timeOtto Octaviusswapped minds with Peter, Max congratulates Peter for Parker Industries' success and Sajani for being appointed manager of the company's European branch. Hector thanks Peter for putting him and Max in charge of the company's west coast operations, the Parker Institute for Technology, but Peter informs them there were a few last minute changes: he renamed the institute theHorizon Universityin honor of Max's now defunctHorizon Labs. Peter says that while he couldn't get any of Max's intellectual property back fromAlchemax, he cut a deal withLiz Allanfor the name. While Max is touched by this gesture, Sajani pulls Peter away to dance, using the opportunity to criticize him for his humanitarian approach instead of dominating the global market. Just as Sajani makes an ominous remark about taking things into her own hands, Peter's Spider-Sense goes off and Zodiac's Pisces Sect emerges from thebay. While Peter offers himself up as a distraction, Hobie changes into his Spider-Man costume.Piscesreveals they are after Peter's Webware specifically, because it has access to restricted data caches. Hobie - as Spider-Man - intervenes, and Peter tells Sajani to help the wedding guests - former Horizon Labs employees - find cover. Hobie's lack of a Spider-Sense gets him knocked out of the fight, and Peter realizes that he could be killed. Encrypting his Webware, he gives it to the Pisces Sect, who depart as thepolicearrive. Peter tells Hobie to change into his Prowler costume and that they'll retrieve the Webware together before Zodiac undoes his encryption, while the Horizon Lab alumni lament that they'll find themselves targeted by supervillains again, reminiscing over past incidents.\nPeter confronts Sajani, who assumes that he's going to ask her out, but instead he reveals that he knows that someone in the company has double-crossed him and that he's well aware that she'd been sabotaging his projects to undermine his authority and usurp control of the company, and that she had colluded with supervillains in the past, making her his number-one suspect. Peter lets her off with a warning that he won't tolerate her insubordination anymore, and a dismayed Sajani returns to the Parker Industries HQ inLondon, where she's greeted byAnna Maria Marconiandthe Living Brain. Sajani irately tells Anna to call an emergency senior staff meeting and advance their nanotech program to Phase Three, brushing aside Anna's protests. Once Sajani is out of earshot, Anna jokingly orders the Living Brain to terminate her, but he responds that his programming prevents him from complying. Anna remarks that she'll have to upgrade his sarcasm-detection software and sets off to comply with Sajani's orders. The Living Brain follows and offers to assist her, making her remark that ever since his last upgrade he's become clingy, not realizing that the Living Brain contains a copy of the consciousness of her deceased lover,Otto Octavius.\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nAt the Bank of the United States, Mr. Santos, a former drug addict, applies for a loan, telling the creditor he's turned his life around for the sake of his daughterJuliana.

As the man continues to fire into the fleeing crowd, demanding to be given money, a strand of webbing hits his gun andSpider-Man, Miguel O'Hara, decks him, noting that the would-be robber is stoned out of his mind. He hears someone crying and turns to see Mr. Santos cradling his daughter, who was killed by the gunman. Furious, Spider-Man grabs the gunman and pins him to a wall, extending his claws.Policearrive and tell him to stand down, and Miguel - about to sink his claws into the gunman's face - complies and leaves.\nClinging to the side of a building, he unmasks himself just asSpider-Man, Peter Parker, arrives to congratulate him.

The home of the gods is under attack by an army of frost giants and humans. This, Thor observes as he and the Warriors Three face the oncoming horde, is the end.\nIn the here and now, James Braddock reports on the mental condition of one of the European Super Soldier Initiative's test subjects, and their continuing mental degradation. Having exhausted all their own resources, the ESS has called in outside help, as his son, Brian Braddock, has come to report.\nThe two Braddocks talk on the subject. The ESS is too behind the American efforts to give up, to say nothing of the fact they don't know what caused the breakdown. Was it something wrong with the man, or something with the technology? This is what they hope their guest, Doctor Donald Blake, can help them with.\nThe two men lead Blake to the patient, filling him in on the way. For the last few days he's been writing something. On a whim, Brian examined it, to find rather than being gibberish, it was in fact poetry. The Prose Edda, which Blake notes is Norse mythology.\nInside the cell, Thorlief Golmen is writing on the floor.\nBlake approaches, and Thorlief tells the man that he is not delusional. He is the god of thunder. Blake examines the strange circular writing Thor is working on, and notes it looks incomplete, not to mention ominous. Thorlief is taken aback that Blake can read his work, and in similar fashion to an Asgard, Blake quotes the last line.\n\"There is a storm coming.\"\nGermany, 1939.\nHeinrich Himmler talks with a subordinate, Baron Zemo, and his request for one hundred thousand men, for a so-called secret mission. Himmler refuses to sign off, until Zemo shows him a box, and its contents. Stones, marked with runes similar. The stuff of legends. Himmler notes they are said to be useless without something dubbed an access point. And Zemo has found one. Immediately, Himmler grants Zemo his men.\nAsgard, long agoThor and Loki rush through thick snow, to reach Balder, who fights an incursion of Frost Giants alone. The giants swarm, only for Thor and Loki to arrive, apologizing for their tardiness, having been carousing with the people of Folkvangr.\nDuring the fight, one giant grabs Loki, reminding him of his mother's sorrow at his absence, and threatens to kill him. Loki instead stabs his attacker, and goes to help Thor with his fight.\nWhen Thor thanks Loki for his assistance, Loki glumly tells him he has too much faith in things, that one day, Ragnarok will come.\nLoki's grim tidings are interrupted by a snowball from Balder, who proclaims victory, but Loki's mood is not lifted, as he wonders whether the war between Asgard and Jotunn will ever end. Balder tells of a secret held by Odin.\nIn Ulik the Dwarve's forge, the smith works at Odin's command to build the perfect weapon: Mjolnir.\nNiebull, Germany, 1939Zemo's forces have set a camp, as the Baron has found the access point. He asks his lieutenant, Helmutt, to tell what he has learn.\nThere are twenty-four stones, and on the control pillar three spaces. In order to activate the device, one must know the secret work, which Zemo does. At his command, many more pillars burst from the ground, forming the Rainbow Gate.\nZemo continues. The gate can reach any of the seven other realms, but any stone can only work with two others in the same sequence. Using the Edda, he can determine which sequence is used to take them to Asgard. But first, he uses a different sequence. After all, while the plan is to raid Asgard, mere men cannot take it alone. That is why Zemo has summoned a company of Frost Giants."

Otto now swears that he is Peter Parker so from now on Otto Octavius is truly dead. His visit is cut short as he receives news via headset transmitter of a newSinister Sixrobbing a science building. Peter/Ock swings into action and is extremely annoyed that such D-List villains (Shocker,Living Brain,Overdrive, the newBeetle,Speed Demon, andBoomerang) get to take the name of the team \"he\" created.\nHe then starts beating them until Speed Demon unleashes a super-speed attack full of fists. Octavius is annoyed and swings away. Boomerang throws a boomerang at him but he dodges. It curves back and is about to hit an officer. \"Spider-Man\" jumps back in to shield the officer with his own body and Octavius doesn't know why he did such a thing. Boomerang comes up and is about to cut off Spidey's head when he turns around and scratches him with his newly implemented claws.\nFor some reason, at this revelation, Boomerang decides to leave along with the rest of the Sinister Six and the officers help \"Spider-Man\" up. The officer is grateful for the save and asks what he can do for him. He tells him to ship the Living Brain toHorizon Labswhere an \"associate\" (i.e. him) can study it.\nBack at Horizon Labs, \"Peter\" looks over his recent shipping of the Living Brain whileGradylooks on in envy. \"Peter\" leaves andMaxappears right behind him and asks Grady if he's seen Peter. Max goes to Peter's lab and asks him about \"helping\" Spider-Man. He says that he's developing weapons and that he can't condone that. \"Peter\" dissuades his fears by showing him the few of many revolutionary new technologies he's exploring that could be used for peace. Max is convinced and in awe of \"Peter\"'s work. He congratulates \"Peter\" and credits all this to the name Peter Parker.\nBack in the Octavius mindset, Ock is angry. All of his work is going to be credited to Peter Parker and not him. He brushes off these fears by repeating to himself that HE is Peter Parker now. Just then,Mary Janecalls \"Peter\" for their date.\nThey go to a restaurant and they talk. Mary Jane asks why Peter is wearing a headset at the date. He reveals to her that when he scratched Boomerang, he injected many nano-Spider-Tracers into him and that now he can hear and follow where they are. Mary Jane is flummoxed. She asks him why he isn't going after them when he knows where they are. Peter brushes it off as \"I know what I'm doing\" and pours himself a glass of wine. Mary Jane is skeptical.\nAt dawn the next day, the new Sinister Six break into Horizon Labs and steal equipment. They run outside to see the whole building webbed around. They are surprised to see Spider-Man already there. Speed Demon rushes him but Spider-Man pushes the spider on his chest and Demon slips. \"Spider-Man\" flashes back to when he swept the floor outside to coat it with a material to make it instantaneously friction-less. \"Spidey\" webs a line so that Speed Demon slips into it with his neck as he's slipping to stop him.\nThe villains are shocked at the brutality as Spidey clicks his spider again. The lights around them turn red. The lights are a power dampening field. The new Beetle collapses as the armor she's wearing is nonfunctional. Shocker's gauntlets are nullified and Overdrives hijackedWheelis useless. \"Spider-Man\" webs the Wheel vehicle and makes it tumble on Shocker. Norah Winters congratulates \"Spidey\" and Boomerang wonders why the press are here. As it turns out, \"Peter\" called them a while ago so that everybody could witness the defeat of the new Sinister Six.\n\"Spider-Man\" lunges at Boomerang just as he's admitting defeat and starts pummeling him. He wants to prove that this is what happens when anybody crosses Spider-Man. He's about to finish him off when something holds him back. The officers arrive and are about to cart the team of super-villains away when suddenly something shocking is revealed. Octavius can't seem to know why he held back when he was dead-set on killing him.Peter'sconsciousness appears and tells him that it was him.\nHowever, Octavius cannot notice him but Peter is still in his body.

Spider-Man then arrives, saying that he came up with an idea and escorts Fury to a secret elevator. He gives Fury a spacesuit and tells him to have the sky above the Baxter Building cleared. He explains that his idea is to use S.H.I.E.L.D.'s satelites to find Scorpio. Fury explains that Scorpio still has control over them ever since he hacked them, but Spidey's idea is to reactivate them manually. They take off in a rocket that he named the \"Arachno-Rocket\".\nMeanwhile, at Scorpio's base in Paris, the villian has been summoned by his newGemini, this time male twins, and wants to know why. They/He explains that he is still new to this and Spider-Man made a plan they didn't see coming by coming up with it right after midnight, as they can see a full day ahead and reset when a new day begins. He sees in the monitor Spidey's rocket coming to his satelites. Gemini explains that they will be able to localize the Orrery, the artifact Scorpio stole, and says he has to destroy it. Scorpio refuses, but is told that otherwise they will be found. Scorpio complains that the \"alignment\" is a few minutes away, but gets the idea to take remote control of the satelites.\nMeanwhile in space, Fury and Spidey arrive at a S.H.I.E.L.D. satelite. They recall that Scopio took control of their satellites to find the relic and that his search program is still on them, so if they hack the satellites, they can use it to find him. They start to work but other S.H.I.E.L.D. satellites arrive and start shotting at them. Fury starts shooting them down with his laser gun, complaining how each will cost over 26 million, while Spidey hacks the satellite. He finds that the relic and the Zodiac Key are inParis, but a satellite to big for Fury's laser appears. Using hisWebware, Spidey has his Arachno-Rocket crash into the satellite, saving them but leaving them stranded. He points Fury to spacewalk towards the International Space Station, while Spidey is going to Paris, a one-way trip. At Scorpio's air, Gemini sense that Spider-Man yet lives and is coming for them, right before the \"alignment\" starts and the Orrery starts shinning. Talking at the same time, Gemini claims that the secret of the Zodiac will be revealed and detect a new constelation forming in the heavens. A thriteen sign of the Zodiac. The sign of the Spider.\nMeanwhile, Spidey is free falling from the oribit, having seconds thought on his plan. His new suit of armor should be able to resist reentering the atmosphere, and then he can use a web-shute to slow his fall. He tells his suit to make a call. Meanwhile,Parker IndustriesLondon,Annais talking to thePrime Ministeron the phone, offering their Webware network to emergency services after various satellites started going down. After the call,Aiden Blainappears with food and they start making out. Then theLiving Brainarrives, offering beverages as usual, butOtto Octavius, inside the Brain, is angered by what he sees. Anna then gets called by Spidey, who explains that he went fromNew Yorkto space and now is in Paris and asks her to come by with a suit. Meanwhile, Spidey is falling to Paris. His new suit managed to resist reentry and he slowed down with web shutes, like he planned, but the chutes were burned away. He eventually runned out of web shutes as the space for his regular webbing has been taking by his special webbings. He comments on the irony of having accesorized himself to death. He activates a beacom for the people below and a device that makes web foam come out of his back and cover him to cushion his fall. In his plan he was going slower, but it should still work. Should being the key word.\nSpidey crashes safetly into Paris. His suit is destroyed, but he still made it from space. But before he can get out of his web ball, it gets blasted by Scorpio with theZodiac Key. He admits that Spidey almost got a drop on him, but he is one day ahead, so Spidey won't make it to tomorrow.\n“SCORPIO RISING” STARTS NOW!"

Kincaid rushes out of the building to go acrosstown, when he realizes he is out of cigarettes and heads into a nearby bodega to get some.\nAs he heads in, he discovers that a robber is holding up the bodega, and demands Kincaid hide behind the counter with the owner. Kincaid tries to explain he needs to leave, but the robber keeps pointing the gun at him. They are then interrupted by the timely arrival ofSpider-Man, who smashes through the window and knocks Kincaid to the ground. Seeing Spider-Man but not knowing who he is, the robber threatens that he will shoot the bodega owner, only for Spider-Man to take him to safety as well with his webs. Spider-Man then tricks the robber into firing all of his bullets at him, which he dodges before breaking his gun.\nSpider-Man eventually webs the robber up, at which point the bodega owner recognizes him as the celebrity from the news. As the owner asks if Spider-Man will eat the robber, the police arrive, prompting him to flee after leaving his trademark note. The police recognize Spider-Man, and begin apprehending the robber, but also force Kincaid to stay to give a witness testimony.\nHours later, Kincaid arrives at the hospital, where it is revealed the thing he needed to do was say goodbye to his dyingfather. He manages to make it in time, and says his goodbye before he passes. Later, he confides in his wifeElliethat he nearly missed his dad’s death for some cigarettes, but she tells him it’s okay because he made it regardless, and that as long as he’s there, everything is okay.\nOver a decade passes. Kincaid’s son graduates high school, while Kincaid himself gets a niece,Judy, via his sister.\nEventually, in modern dayChinatown, Spider-Man is fighting theInner Demons, who are trying to steal a suitcase of money. One of them manages to run away, but a man (at Spider-Man’s request) trips him, allowing Spider-Man to catch him. The man is revealed to be an older Kincaid, and he hands Spider-Man the money. Kincaid mentions to him that Spider-Man once saved his life, though he does not remember. When he asks what he did, Kincaid says that Spider-Man “got [him] to quit smoking”, though this leaves him even more confused.\nAs Spider-Man leaves, Judy is revealed to be with Kincaid. Judy calls the interaction lame, saying that Spider-Man pales in comparison to more powerful heroes who save the world routinely. Kincaid contests this by saying that Spider-Man also saves the world every day, because every person he rescues means the world to somebody. He concludes by saying that Spider-Man also saves a person’s uncle routinely, referring to himself but also unknowingly tying in to Peter’sUncle Ben. Judy then admits that Spider-Man is cool, and the two walk off together, as both Kincaid and Spider-Man say to Judy and the world respectively, “I’ll always be here for you”."

Eddie remarks that it feels wrong that Flash is the one dead and buried while he's still alive; admitting that for all his tough talk about being the original Venom he can tellthe symbiotepreferred Flash as a host, and that even with its voice gone he can feel it still trying to reach out to him.The Makerinterrupts, asking Eddie if he's finished, and presses a button on the side of a tombstone - revealing the cemetery to be a hologram. As the Venom symbiote transforms back into a T-shirt and jeans, the Maker asks Eddie where they were. Eddie recounts the gist of their prior conversation, the Maker snarking that the question was rhetorical and that he has an eidetic memory. Eddie reiterates that he had nothing to do with the theft of the Maker'ssampleof thesymbiote-dragon, though the Maker - pouring himself a cup of coffee - remarks that the symbiote may be hiding information and until his curiosity is sated Eddie will remainProject Oversight's prisoner. When Eddie states that he wants to go home, the Maker asks him where he considers home to be - given that his apartment in New York was vacated. When the Maker begins speculating why the symbiote brought Eddie to his father's home in San Francisco, Eddie snaps that he's had enough. The Maker asks Eddie where he'd go if Project Oversight let him leave, Eddie admitting that he'd go visit Flash's grave to pay respects for real.\nSmirking, the Maker tells Eddie there's something he'd like to show him, taking him to a morgue where he holds up a vial containing a sample of symbiote biomass, which he introduces as Corporal Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson. In response to Eddie's shock, he reveals that the symbiote biomass was extracted from a sample of Flash's blood taken during his time as Agent Venom. The Maker remarks that even after a symbiote is separated from its host, trace remnants - which he dubs a codex - remain inside the host's body. As he returns Flash's codex to a cold storage device, the Maker remarks that the sample of the Grendel symbiote could contain information about the symbiotes that could revolutionize scientific progress. When Eddie interrupts, asking what that has to do with him, the Maker remarks that he theorizes that harvesting the symbiote's codexes and returning them to the host could reactivate its connection to the hive mind. When he announces his intent to exhume and vivisect Flash's body to obtain additional samples, rebuking Eddie's outrage as misplaced sentimentality, Eddie Venomizes and smashes him face-first into the wall of the morgue, shattering his helmet's visor. As Venom roars at him to leave Flash alone, the Maker grumbles that he woke up the dog and tries to use his shape-shifting abilities to break free.\nThe symbiote separates from Eddie, who notes that he can feel its presence for the first time since fighting the Grendel symbiote and opens a morgue locker. The symbiote immobilizes the Maker and drags him inside, Eddie slamming the door as it returns to him with Flash's codex. Lamenting that it'll always prefer Flash to him, Eddie scolds himself for feeling sorry for himself and runs out into the hall only to be confronted by a squad of soldiers armed with sonic cannons. As the soldiers blast him, Eddie recoils into the morgue and slams the door, wondering how they'll escape. In response, the Venom symbiote grabs Flash's codex and shatters the vial to absorb it, causing Flash Thompson's personality to emerge - which transforms the symbiote into its Agent Venom appearance. Permitting Flash's personality to take over, Eddie is again reduced to a passenger but remarks that this feels completely different from when Knull was trying to take over the symbiote - less like drowning and more like backup. As Agent Venom easily trounces the soldiers and escapes the building, using tendrils to steal and wield multiple firearms simultaneously; Eddie notes that this is simply an echo of Flash that the symbiote is channeling because it doesn't have a voice of its own, but that he can't help but marvel at Flash's prowess and begrudgingly admits that Flash made a badass Venom.\nLater, the Maker walks down a hallway, instructing the facility's AI to erase a section of security footage. The AI asks if he means the period he spent locked in the autopsy drawer, causing the Maker to irately deactivate it. Extending his eyeball for a retinal identification scan, the Maker enters a room with several view-screens displayingthe Unseen,Morlunof theInheritors,Thanos's corpse,Galactusand theSilver Surfer, and members of theSpider-Army. Remarking that Eddie escaping is only a minor setback due to him secretly having a tracking device implanted into him, the Maker wonders what will come next.\nLater still, Eddie stands before Flash Thompson's grave in the real Arlington National Cemetery, thanking him for his posthumous help escaping the lab and sadly noting that the codex seems to have burnt out, leaving him alone inside his head once more. Nevertheless, Eddie states he'll keep fighting the good fight, calling Flash his brother and telling him to get some rest. Departing the cemetery, Eddie resolves to deal with his personal issues - gazing into the abyss and making it blink for once - and boards a bus to San Francisco.\nElsewhere, a figure clad in a hooded brown cloak walks down an underground tunnel, carrying a torch. The figure announces that his team was successful in infiltrating Project Oversight and escaping unnoticed, producing the sample of the Grendel symbiote and giving it to a second cultist -a womanwearinga purple bodysuitunder her cloak. The woman announces that they act so that darkness can devour the light and thattheir lordcan awaken in his new vessel and return all to the void - the torch illuminating a stasis pod containing the desiccated, badly-burnt body ofCletus Kasady.\n“THE ABYSS” CONTINUES!\n• After the gut-wrenching events of last issue, Eddie Brock finds himself alone for the first time in a LONG time, and the silence is deafening…"

She attempts to flee but is pursued and soon knocked out by a combination of the suits' repulsor blasts and a punch from theModel 52, causing her to plummet.\nTwo years earlier, Riri is working at her garage while talking toNatalie, who's trying to convince the young genius to help her with her crush at the picnic the following day. As Natalie leaves, Riri continues working on her rocket pack.\nBack to the present, Riri uses her armor's flight boots and stabilizers to avoid crashing into the water. However, theModel 3tackles her from behind and plunges her into the water, to the surprise of the bystanders at the bay.\nIn the past again, shortly after the picnic shootout, Riri and her mother are at a hospital and receive confirmation about the death of Riri's step-father. When the doctor refuses to give Riri any information regarding Natalie due to the absence of any family members, she rushes to the emergency room. Riri walks past the turmoil in the room and focuses on a bed with nobody by its side, and a sheet that covers the person's entire body. She lifts up the blanket and is shocked as she unveils Natalie's body. Riri begs her not to die, and a nurse abruptly holds her down. Riri is forcefully escorted out of the room as she breaks down into tears, demanding the nurses not to touch Natalie.\nNow, Riri flies out of the water and manages to get the Model 3 to let go of her, while the digital Tony Stark keeps reminding her she can't keep running away. The other suits continue giving chase, and when they catch up with her, Riri avoids them by abruptly going in reverse.\nBack in the past, a detective interrogates Riri andher motherregarding the tragic events. While Mrs. Williams provides the detective with all the information she can, Riri fixates on a TV on the wall behind him, where the news report several superhuman battles, including a fight betweenIron Man,Spider-Man, andStilt Man. When the detective directs his attention to Riri, she questions with a deadpan expression why is she alive. The detective stumbles on his words and is unable to find an answer, while Riri continues looking at the TV as it shows a closeup of Iron Man.\nIn the present, the digital Tony Stark questions once again why does Riri keep running away, when suddenly the armor that were chasing her suddenly go numb and fall into the water. She explains that she wasn't actually trying to escape, but she was stalling for time while she uploaded a virus into the neural network of the suits. The A.I. Tony congratulates Riri, and she flies away after accidentally activating one of her repulsors and propelling herself away.\nSomewhere else,Zhangis showingTomoea tablet playing a video of the sightings of a supposedly new Iron Man. Tomoe proclaims that the appearance of a new Iron Man could compromise her plans, and orders Zhang to dispose of this potential threat immediately."

More over, Wakanda needs a new Black Panther to defend their country against whoever attack T'Challa.\nFive hours ago, T'Challa, accompanied by two of his Dora Milaje bodyguards, arrive at Namor's estate. Namor informs him of the \"Cabal\" Norman Osborn had formed, including Namor himself, Loki, Emma Frost, the Hood and Doctor Doom. He asks for T'Challa to join this illusive group so that Wakanda can be prepared for the upcoming war; T'Challa states that he did not join the Illuminati and would not for the Cabal too. He knows very well that Osborn is a madman and that his alliance will not last. He also adds that Wakanda defended itself against the Skrulls weeks ago. As soon as T'Challa and Namor part ways, the former's path to his personal jet is blocked by Doom himself and a squad of Doombots. And this time, Doom is not here to recruit him, but to kill him.

White\nFeatured Characters:\nSupporting Characters:\nAntagonists:\nOther Characters:\nRaces and Species:\nLocations:\nItems:\nVehicles:\nThis story continues fromAll-New X-Men Special#1...\nThe Hulk is coming back from destroying a colony of intelligent super-tarantulas. As he approaches his S.H.I.E.L.D. pick up point, they prepare to deal with the gamma-spawned brute. When he arrives, they open a series of large metal containers which contain a whole bunch of playful puppies. This delights the Hulk who calms down enough to trigger a reversion back into Bruce Banner. Bruce learns that he is being deployed again, but this time they don't need the strength of the Hulk, but the mind of Bruce Banner. Soon a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter brings Banner to Empire State University where he meets with Spider-Man, time-displaced original X-Men, and Dr. Jude. After the pleasantries are exchanged, Banner does a double take when he realizes how young these X-Men are, prompting the Beast to explain the situation. They also explain the appearance of a younger, healthier, Doctor Octopus whom they have a prisoner. The X-Men believe that he must have followed them forward in time, although Spider-Man can't bring himself to believe it.\nWhen Banner suggests that they use the resources that S.H.I.E.L.D. has provided him, neither the X-Men or Spider-Man want to get involved with the anti-espionage agency. Banner agrees and they start working at Empire State University instead. Soon, Bruce, Dr. Jude, the Beast and Spider-Man get to work to try and understand who this Doctor Octopus was and why he is immitting gamma radiation. As they work on solving this mystery, Bruce Banner cannot help but be impressed at the scientific knowledge that Spider-Man has at his disposal. He also wonders how a great scientist like Dr. Jude could be reduced to such an undignified position at ESU after being such an accomplished scientist. They theorize the possibility that this is actually some kind of construct of Octavius, but they cannot figure out who could have made it or why. While Spider-Man carries out more tests, the Beast observes the proceedings with Dr. Jude's student Molly. Henry becomes bashful when she starts asking him if he is currently dating somebody when suddenly there is a large crash from outside.\nBruce, Spider-Man, and Hank rush outside and witness the rest of the X-Men battling what appears to be the Abomination. Banner suspects this may be another time displacement as the Abomination is dead. However, he realizes that the X-Men are no match for this foe and tells Spider-Man to get them to cover. Banner then approaches the Abomination and before his long-time foe can attack him, Banner transforms into the Hulk. With the battle between the two raging on, Spider-Man tells the X-Men that they need to get to their time machine and investigate what is going on. However, the blows between the two powerhouses cause a hole to open up in the ground. When Molly falls in, the Beast goes to save her, Dr. Jude says there is no time. However, Henry is not willing to leave the girl in danger and leaps down to recover her. As the Hulk and the Abomination battle it out in the nearby football field, Spider-Man commandeers the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter that brought Banner to them. When Iceman sees that he is bringing Doctor Octopus, he protests this move. However, Spider-Man is more interested in sending the apparent time displaced villain back to where he came from.\nMeanwhile, the Beast finds Molly, who is miraculously unhurt. However, she has discovered a secret lab beneath the school. At that moment on the surface, the Hulk strikes the Abomination with such force he decapitates his opponent, revealing it to be nothing more than a robot. Meanwhile, Beast and Molly discover a number of pieces of equipment that she had wrote grant requests for and was told that she was denied. They also find schematics to create a Doctor Octopus robot. Realizing what's going on, the Beast asks to use Molly's cell phone to tell the others. When Spider-Man receives the call he turns to confront Doctor Jude. Realizing his ruse has been exposed, the doctors eyes begin to glow and suddenly the helicopter explodes.\nThis story is continued inSuperior Spider-Man Team-Up Special#1...\nPART TWO OF “THE ARMS OF THE OCTOPUS!”"

Cyclops tells her that they're going to take her somewhere safe and teach her how to use her powers.\nEva then asks him why he's doing this, and Cyclops responds that he has so much to atone for and that he needs to make things right with the world and make it a better place for mutants. He asks for Eva's help in doing this. Eva manages to undo the temporal freeze when the military suddenly charge and point their guns at her. The guns suddenly crumble, as Cyclops, Magneto and Emma Frost then attack.\nStorm, Iceman and Kitty Pryde watch it on the news and Iceman says he's astonished that Cyclops would go so far. He also says that what is going on now is worse than the apocalyptic future for mutants they used to worry about when they were young. Storm remarks that Beast really should see this.\nMeanwhile, in the police station in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a boy is being interrogated by the police for bringing back his friend to life after she fell and hit her head. The police accuse him of being a mutant when suddenly Cyclops and Magik burst in and free him. Cyclops stands in front of the security camera and sends a message to mutants, telling them not to let humanity dictate the course of their lives and that they deserve freedom.\nMeanwhile, Iceman tries to convince the others that they need to shut him down but Storm refuses, telling them that a mutant civil war is the worst thing that could happen to them now. Kitty argues that they need to do something or the government is going to shut their school down. Iceman remarks that the Scott they grew up with would never stand for something like this and he'd stop the Scott of the present. Beast tells him he's right and abruptly leaves.\nMeanwhile, in the past, Hank and Bobby return to the mansion from being attacked by a mob of angry humans. Hank tells Scott that he's fed up with putting his life on the line for humans that hate him and that he's leaving the X-Men. Just as he's about to storm out, he finds present day Beast standing in the doorway. After explaining who he is, Beast asks Cyclops of the past to help him stop his future self from committing mutant genocide."

The Goblin King expresses that with \"Peter's (ex girlfriend)\"seemingly dead, he might as well search for someone elseSpider-Mancares about. Meanwhile,Alchemaxmembers are discussing withMayor Jamesonin order to activate theGoblin Slayerssince theAvengersand even outside vigilantes likeCardiacare way too busy dealing with the Goblin King's minions. Jameson argues that they must be activated once Spider-Man is out, since he ordered their creation to destroy him, but his assistantGlory Grantshows her disgust about Jonah's behavior and the fact that he's refusing to concede his late wife's dying wish in order to pursuit his vendetta against Spider-Man and promptly quits her job.\nOutside of thecity,Mary Janearrives toConnecticutwith AuntMay,Jonah Sr. andOllieto keep them safe, but then she receives a phone call from \"Peter\" who warns her to stay safe. She replies that she already did that but when she tries to tell him about Aunt May's worriness, he brushes her off rudely. Otto tries to find a safe way to cure Carlie's condition  while arguing withSajanibut then he's interrupted by the Goblin King who taunts him into a challenge. The Goblin comments that he's upset that Otto stole his biggest prize: killingSpider-Man, so since he refused to become his lackey, he's taking everything away from him, and he does so by forcing him to witness through his goggles the destruction of his childhood house, the atomic laboratory where he suffered the accident that made him into Doctor Octopus, theBoneyardwhere most of his inventions are storaged, the Mocha Cola Bottling Plant where he fended off Massacre's bombs and saved the hostages who are performing night shift, and the H.E.A.R.T. Clinic where he assisted Cardiac, who is dealing with some of the Goblin's minions. Otto shows a desire of vengeance after witnessing all that destruction, but the Goblin King taunts him that he's not over yet, as he has one final card at theEmpire State Universitywhere he holds one of his schoolmates hostage, making Otto ask himself how Peter managed to handle himself in such a situation.\nIn the Mindscape, what is left of Peter's consciousness has merged with Otto's memories, now reaching the point where he witnesses all the times he, as Spider-Man, has beaten Doctor Octopus, going as far to the day where he discovers he's dying and only has a few months left to live, activating his desire for his final vengeance against Spider-Man. Meanwhile Otto tries to reach the ESU and callsChief Pratchettto deal with the minor robberies, but the Chief refuses to assist him. Mayor Jameson orders Pratchett to send one of the Goblin Slayers to the robbery location and then head to chase Spider-Man, butTiberiusdiscovers thatMichael O' Mara, his assistant, has disappeared.\nSpider-Man arrives to the ESU ready to confront the Goblin King who reveals that his hostage is actuallyDon Lamaze, his teacher as \"Peter\" but also his former schoolmate as Otto. Otto dismisses his plan as a joke but the Goblin replies that he still has another hostage. As Otto launches to attack with his mechanical arms, the Goblin King reveals that he also hacked his arms, making them attack Otto but as the arms attack him, Lamaze jumps into one of them receiving the fatal stab. Otto asks why he did it and Lamaze replies that he did it to repay him for saving his life whenStunnerattacked, thanking him to make him see what a hero is. He cradles Lamaze in his arms as the latter dies.\nOtto ponders on how he will track down the Goblin King but then he's confronted by a legion of Spider Slayers with Jameson's face projected on the front faceplate. Jameson replies that he's done with being blackmailed by him and he doesn't care if he loses everything, as long as he can finally bring down Spider-Man. Otto tries to fight the Slayers, but discovers that they're far stronger than all the previous ones. Suddenly the Slayers are deactivated remotely by Spider-Man 2099, who confronts Otto about who he really is and the reasons behind his actions of late, when suddenly the Slayers are reactivated, to Spider-Man 2099's shock. The Goblin King's voice rings out, declaring that he has taken control of the Slayers as well, which grab both Spider-Men by their heads.\nTO BE CONTINUED.\n“Goblin Nation” - Part 3 of 5\n• The Spider-Slayer Squadron were supposed to be under Mayor J.

Tony proposes creating a unified group of all the world's superhumans. After some discussion, the assembled decide to meet in secret and discuss threats to the entire world. Despite having hosted the meeting, Black Panther warns them against this, and refuses to participate.\nIn present-day Wakanda, a trio of promising youngsters solve the last puzzle of an obstacle course and are commended by T'Challa, King of the Dead and Black Panther, as the country's newest Makers.  Suddenly, a startled rhinoceros breaks through a sort of barrier.  T'Challa investigates and finds that the barrier is a veil. Behind it, the sky is dark and a second Earth looms large in the sky. Six figures descend from that Earth to land on Wakanda.\nThe figures are a strike team, armed, and lead by an alternate-universe version ofManifoldand a blond woman in black. T'Challa and the three teenagers confront them.  The woman calls herself a Black Swan but denies that the dark sky and the encroaching Earth is her doing.  She tells him she has come to destroy a world.  When T'Challa replies that he will stop her, she calmly orders the guards to kill them.\nTwo of the teens are killed instantly by blasts which break through T'Challa's shields.  He takes the third, N'Kono, and runs for cover, but the guards find them and the boy dies in T'Challa's arms. The Black Panther goes on the offensive, killing the guards and working his way back to the Black Swan and Manifold.\nShe takes a device from Manifold and asks if he can pay the \"offering.\" When he refuses, she kills him with a blast from her eyes and directs the device at the world overhead.  Just as she triggers it, Black Panther tears through the last of her guards and reaches her.  He knocks her down, but the Earth explodes overhead and the world around him instantly returns to normal.\nThe next day, T'Challa prays to Bast for salvation... from what he is about to do.  One or two at a time, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Namor, Reed Richards, Doctor Strange, and Black Bolt -- the Illuminati -- are arriving in Wakanda."

However, Strange barely hears the warnings.\nElsewhere, the Watcher looms over Adam Brashear, the former Blue Marvel, as he analyses some readings in his undersea fortress. The man talks about problems he's facing, with his wife's passing, and his reluctance to join the Avengers. After a few minutes he realizes Uatu isn't there to socialize, and examines his emergency monitoring system. To his alarm, it declares a level seven event is occurring, which particularly troubles Brashear since he built the system, and it's previously never gone higher than four.\nIn New York, the ragtag assortment of heroes find themselves dealing with the level seven event. The Superior Spider-Man tries to call in reinforcements, but his spider-minions are also under attack. As he engages Proxima's troops, Spider-Hero chides him for talking too much. Proxima, meanwile, targets Monica Rambeau, recognizing her as the leader of the group. Her lance incapacitates Monica, and distracted by her pain, Luke Cage is taken out by a vicious beatdown from the alien. Then, the citizens of New York city start throwing bricks at Proxima, to no effect, before repeatedly yelling \"Avengers Assemble.\"\nThe defiance is enough to anger Proxima Midnight, but also enough to provoke a second wind in Luke Cage. As he hits, the ground begins to shake, something Spider-Hero notes isn't entirely the fight's fault, but rather because something is being summoned.\nAny further fighting is forestalled by Thanos contacting his servant, reminding her of her other obligations elsewhere. Reluctantly, Midnight leaves, though not before informing the Avengers present that Monica is still poisoned by her staff, and will die in minutes.\nAs the gathered heroes start trying to help Monica, something else happens. An ominous voice echoes out, as Doctor Strange, still in the Ebony Maw's thrall, summons none other than Shuma-Gorath.\nAs he arrives on the scene, The Blue Marvel notes that the new development counts as a level eight disaster.\nINFINITY TIE-IN! new ongoing series!\n• Proxima Midnight is killing New York City one block at a time...\n• Luke Cage’s ad-hoc Avengers might not be able to stop her...\n• And the one hero who can is at the bottom of the Mariana Trench."

Tataina asks if she's dead, and proceeds to drug her with a lethal spider by forcing it down her throat; if she bites down it will kill her, so she must tell her what Spider-Man is doing in her visions (the spider induces her powers.) She manages to lie, stating that he is \"surrounded by loved ones.\"\nMeanwhile Peter is in his apartment asking Michele if they are going to talk about the other night but then sees Michele trying to shove his stuff into the garage disposal. Peter stops her and asks Michele is if she is out of her mind, Michele says she's defiantly out of patience and believes Peter is trying to distract her from the pig she thinks he is. Peter says that went out the window when she punched him in the jaw recently. Peter laments this is why people invented coffee to deal with situations like this. Peter begins to say to Michele that its not her but she interrupts him saying that if he says that he will be the next thing she throws into the trash compactor waist first. Before the argument gets any further they are interrupted by Norah Winter who begins flirting with Peter and mentioning the Osbourn story a few issues back before Michele interrupts and she and Nora begin arguing about Peter when a third voice begins saying knock knock before Peter is consumed by his frustration yells at the person at the door to go away before realising its Mary Jane he just yelled at to go away. Mary Jane then says she'll drop by another time despite Peter saying its fine before Michele storms off into her room shortly followed by Nora who slams Peter's own bedroom door in his face. The garbage disposal with Peter's stuff in it erupts in flames and Peter sighs heavily.\nFourteen hours later Peter now as Spider-Man is swinging through the city after catching a thug trying to mug an old lady while lamenting on his recent troubles while the thug screams his head off and pisses himself with Spidey saying thats what you get for being a mugger. Suddenly the flagpole Spider-Man has landed on suddenly comes loose from its screws and Spidey and the mugger begin falling before Spider-Man quick webs onto a statue but a chunk of the statue that holds the webbing comes off the statue and if things couldn't possibly gets worse one of Spidey's web shooters fall apart and then the other one jams when he attempts to use it. Spidey then comments that he hates his life . The mugger then lands in the pool while Spidey lands roughly on the concrete next to the pool but unharmed. Spidey then asks himself if his bad luck will ever end before a voice tells him he shouldn't blame it on her. Spidey looks up and is surprised to see his ex-girlfriend Felicia Hardy AKA the Black Cat lying on a pool chair. Spidey asks if the her bad luck powers are back. Felicia says they are more like hilarity ensures powers to her but does confirm her bad luck powers are back.\nSpider-Man sarcastically then says if he should send Black Cat his chiropractor bill. Cat then asks Spidey about his recent stint in jail a few issues back before walking off. Spidey tries to follow Felicia but finds that his web fluid has stuck his hands to the pool chair and loses his balance and falls into the pool. The wall crawler asks Cat why she is breaking into the house but Black avoids his question and asks if Spidey is staring at her breasts which succeeds in making him uncomfortable. After dodging around some lasers and discussing their previous relationship the duo come across a safe when Spidey realises that they are in Dexter Bennetts house and asks Black Cat why she is robbing Dexter Bennett. Black Cat proceeds to open the safe and to their shock find a corpse in the safe with his insides spilling out what appears to be concrete. Spidey jokingly asks Cat if he cut him off in traffic and he 'accidentally' got killed. Not catching his joke Felicia says that's not her style and Spidey points out that he is joking to keep the urge to vomit away.\nBlack Cat grabs a ledger from inside the safe while Spidey examines the body accidentally crushing the corpses 'spleen' when the body suddenly explodes with Spidey narrowly avoiding it thanks to his spider sense but pallets then shoot towards him and Spider-Man guesses correctly that they are moving to slow to be bullets when they hit the wall behind him that he just leapt off then sprout off into spikes to his horror. Spidey tries to protect himself and Black Cat with the door but the spikes pierce thought the door slashing the wall crawler with minor cuts to his frustration. He begs Black Cat to un-bad luck him now. Suddenly, the villain Diablo appears and comments that they weren't the corpse he expected. Black Cat asks Spidey any clue and Spidey jokes that its Dr. Kevorkian's evil cousin. Cat snaps at the wall crawler saying its Diablo and she meant \"Any clue to what he's doing here?\" and comments if he wasn't so good in the sack he would be completely useless, Spidey then retorts that she though he was good in the sack before being hit by one of Diablo's chemical bombs blasting him outside and slamming into the mugger in the process who was just walking off and sending him tumbling into the pool again.\nCat smoothers Spidey with a blanket and checks to see if he was burnt but the wall crawler is only slightly dazed and tells Felicia he's fine. Spider-Man notices Felicia's red ledger in her hand and tries to ask questions as to why she grabbed that book but Black Cat refuses to answer his question before bidding Spidey farewell and she'll see him in the next life. before grappling off and talking to her unseen employer noticing Bennett was target not a player. Finally had enough with all the problems with the women in his life Spidey shouts aloud to himself that have women gone crazy especially Black Cat. Spidey confronts Black Cat saying she dumped him because she didn't love the person under the mask and why is he the bad guy in this situation. Black Cat begins to say its not him but her but the wall crawler cuts her off saying he's already used that line today so she doesn't get to use that on him but Cat says it is her. Even though she forgot who Spidey was underneath the mask all her past life came rushing back to her: The thrills and the heartaches and she was just trying to avoid that buts trails off and lifts up the bottom part of Spider-Man's mask and Spidey notices her breath is getting all choppy before they embrace and passionately kiss each other unaware their escapades and their kiss is being broadcast all over New York by news feeds for all to see including Mary Jane.\nhttp://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12939"
